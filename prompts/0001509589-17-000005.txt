Item 1. Business
When we use the terms “Bonanza Creek,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” we are referring to Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires. We have included certain technical terms important to an understanding of our business under Glossary of Oil and Natural Gas Terms above. Throughout this document we make statements that may be classified as “forward-looking” Please refer to the Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section above for an explanation of these types of statements.
Overview
Bonanza Creek is an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of onshore oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas in the United States. Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on December 2, 2010 and went public in December 2011. 
Our oil and liquids-weighted assets are concentrated primarily in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado and the Dorcheat Macedonia Field in southern Arkansas. In addition, we own and operate oil-producing assets in the North Park Basin in Colorado and the McKamie Patton Field in southern Arkansas. The Wattenberg Field is one of the premier oil and gas resource plays in the United States benefiting from a low cost structure, strong production efficiencies, established reserves and prospective drilling opportunities, which allows for predictable production and reserve growth. 
Bankruptcy Proceedings under Chapter 11
Restructuring Support Agreement
On December 23, 2016, the Company entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the “RSA”) with (i) holders of approximately 51% in aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 5.75% Senior Notes due 2023 and 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 and (ii) NGL Energy Partners, LP and NGL Crude Logistics, LLC. 
The RSA contemplates, among other things, (a) the equitization of the Company’s unsecured obligations pursuant to the Plan, including approximately $800 million in principal amount of Senior Notes, (b) a fully backstopped rights offering for the purchase of $200 million of common stock of reorganized Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc., and (c) the entry into a new crude oil purchase agreement between the Company and NGL Crude Logistics, LLC.
Voluntary Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Proceedings 
On January 4, 2017 (the “Petition Date”), the Company and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (the “Bankruptcy Petitions,” and the cases commenced thereby, collectively, the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”) to pursue the Debtors’ Joint Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Prepackaged Plan”). The Debtors are authorized to operate their businesses as debtors in possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. 
The Bankruptcy Court has granted on a final basis all of the first day motions filed by the Debtors seeking relief that would minimize the impact of the Chapter 11 Cases on the Company's operations, customers and employees. As a result, the Company is not only authorized to conduct business activities in the ordinary course and generally pay all associated obligations for the period following the Petition Date without further Bankruptcy Court approval, but it is also currently authorized to pay and has paid, subject to certain limitations, obligations that arose prior to the Petition Date related to employee wages and benefits, services and supplies provided by vendors in the ordinary course of business and mineral interests held by royalty holders and other partners. In general, during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, all transactions outside the ordinary course of our business require the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court. As a result of the automatic stay under the Bankruptcy Code, which became effective upon the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, most judicial or administrative actions against the Company by its creditors to collect on or otherwise exercise rights or remedies with respect to claims that arose before the Petition Date are stayed during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.
A hearing to consider confirmation of the Prepackaged Plan and approval of the Debtors’ Disclosure Statement is currently scheduled to begin on April 3, 2017.

For the duration of our Chapter 11 proceedings, our operations and our ability to develop and execute our business plan are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 cases as described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” As a result of these risks and uncertainties, our assets, liabilities, officers and/or directors could be significantly different following the outcome of the Chapter 11 proceedings, and the description of our operations, properties and capital plans included in this Annual Report may not accurately reflect our operations, properties and capital plans following the Chapter 11 process. 
For a further description of these matters, see Note 19 - Subsequent Events.
Our Business Strategies
We scaled back our capital expenditures to match our liquidity constraints and current commodity pricing environment. We invested $21.7 million on capital projects in 2016 versus $404.0 million in 2015.
While faced with these liquidity restraints, we have taken various steps to reduce our operating costs. During 2016, we eliminated unnecessary costs and negotiated with our primary suppliers and service providers resulting in a 33% reduction in our lease operating expenses. 
Our strategy is to operate a development program on contiguous acreage blocks that have high working interest, allowing us to control the pace and magnitude of our future capital expenditures and provide efficient resource development through multi-well pads and centralized facilities. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, management currently intends to operate a one-rig program in 2017 to drill 61 operated standard reach lateral equivalent wells that are within close proximity to the Company's existing infrastructure to keep costs down.
In 2016, we successfully drilled ten and completed 13 gross productive operated wells and participated in drilling seven and completing eight gross productive non-operated wells. We had six gross operated wells and seven gross non-operated wells drilled and awaiting completion as of December 31, 2016. Our sales volumes during the fourth quarter of 2016 were 18,239 Boe/d, a 36% decrease over the comparable period in 2015. 
The following tables summarize our estimated proved reserves, PV-10 reserve value, sales volumes, and projected capital spend as of December 31, 2016:

_____________________

(1) | Proved reserves and related future net revenue and PV-10 were calculated using prices equal to the twelve-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for each of the preceding twelve months, which were $42.75 per Bbl WTI and $2.48 per MMBtu HH. Adjustments were then made for location, grade, transportation, gravity, and Btu content, which resulted in a decrease of $4.33 per Bbl of crude oil and a decrease of $0.41 per MMBtu of natural gas.


(2) | PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquid reserves, less future development and production costs, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash inflows using the twelve-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices, after adjustment for differentials in location and quality, for each of the preceding twelve months. We believe that PV-10 provides useful information to investors as it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors when evaluating oil and gas companies. We believe that PV-10 is relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our reserves. Professional analysts and sophisticated investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies’ reserves. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable in evaluating the Company and our reserves. PV-10 is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated reserves. PV-10 differs from Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (“Standardized Measure”) because it does not include the effect of future income taxes. Please refer to the Reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure presented in the “Reserves” subsection of Item 1 below.


(3) | Mid-Continent sales volumes were 4,063 Boe/d for 2016, which is comprised of 3,653 Boe/d of production net to our interest and 410 Boe/d sales volumes from our percentage-of-proceeds contracts.

Our Operations
Our operations are mainly focused in the Wattenberg Field in the Rocky Mountain region and in the Dorcheat Macedonia Field in the Mid-Continent region.
Rocky Mountain Region
The two main areas in which we operate in the Rocky Mountain region are the Wattenberg Field in Weld County, Colorado and the North Park Basin in Jackson County, Colorado. As of December 31, 2016, our estimated proved reserves in the Rocky Mountain region were 77,934 MBoe, which represented 86% of our total estimated proved reserves and contributed 17,619 Boe/d, or 81%, of sales volumes during 2016.
Wattenberg Field - Weld County, Colorado. Our operations are in the oil and liquids-weighted extension area of the Wattenberg Field targeting the Niobrara and Codell formations. As of December 31, 2016, our Wattenberg position consisted of approximately 96,000 gross (67,000 net) acres. 
The Wattenberg Field is now primarily developed for the Niobrara and Codell formations using horizontal drilling and multi-stage fracture stimulation techniques. We believe the Niobrara B and C benches have been fully delineated on our legacy acreage, while the Codell formation has been delineated on our western acreage. Our northern acreage is in the early stages of delineation. 
 Our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 in the Wattenberg Field were 77,730 MBoe. As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 628 gross producing wells, of which 406 were horizontal wells, and our sales volumes during 2016 were 
14

17,543 Boe/d. Our sales volumes for the fourth quarter of 2016 were 14,508 Boe/d. As of December 31, 2016, our working interest for all producing wells averaged approximately 89% and our net revenue interest was approximately 73%.
We drilled and participated in drilling 18 gross (9.5 net) standard reach lateral equivalent wells and one vertical well in 2016 in the Wattenberg Field. In 2016, we completed and participated in completing a total of 27 gross (14.0 net) standard reach lateral equivalent wells and one vertical well in the Wattenberg Field. As of December 31, 2016, we have an identified drilling inventory of approximately 210 gross (163.4 net) proved undeveloped (“PUD”) drilling locations (226 gross standard reach lateral equivalents) on our acreage. 
During the year, in the Niobrara benches, we drilled two extended reach lateral operated wells, six standard reach lateral operated wells and one vertical operated well and we completed four medium reach lateral operated wells, eight standard reach lateral operated wells and one vertical operated well. In addition, we drilled one Codell standard reach lateral operated well. We also participated in the drilling of six standard reach lateral wells (0.01 net) and the completion of five extended reach lateral wells (0.5 net) in the Niobrara formation.
Upon emergence from bankruptcy, based on the plan provided to signatories to the RSA, management currently intends to operate a one-rig program with an intermittent second rig to satisfy leasehold obligations within the Wattenberg Field in 2017. The capital requirements expected for this program range from $160.0 million to $175.0 million for the time period from May to December 2017. This program contemplates drilling and completing 61 gross operated standard reach lateral equivalent wells, participating in economic non-operated wells that are proposed and investing a modest amount on infrastructure. The capital budget is dependent on emergence from bankruptcy and approval from a newly appointed board and could vary, given, for example, that we observed evidence of an increase in drilling and completion costs since year end. 
North Park Basin - Jackson County, Colorado. We control approximately 19,000 gross (15,000 net) acres in the North Park Basin in Jackson County, Colorado, all prospective for the Niobrara oil shale. We operate the North and South McCallum Fields, which currently produce light oil, which is trucked to market. 
In the North Park Basin, our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 were approximately 204 MBoe, consisting of 100% crude oil, and our sales volumes during 2016 were 76 Boe/d. Our sales volumes in the North Park Basin for the fourth quarter of 2016 were 72 Boe/d. There were no wells drilled during 2016 in the North Park Basin. 
None of our 2017 capital budget is assigned to the North Park Basin. 
Mid-Continent Region
In southern Arkansas, we target the oil-rich Cotton Valley sands in the Dorcheat Macedonia and McKamie Patton Fields. As of December 31, 2016, our estimated proved reserves in the Mid-Continent region were 12,716 MBoe, which is inclusive of a reduction of 7.8 MMBoe of PUDs due to an inability to demonstrate a commitment to deploy capital into this program during 2016, 69% of which were oil and NGLs and 100% of which were proved developed. We currently have 308 gross producing vertical wells. During 2016, no wells were drilled in the Mid-Continent region; however, the Company recompleted 32 wells in the Cotton Valley formation. We achieved a sales volume rate for 2016 of 4,063 Boe/d, of which 70% was from oil and NGLs, and a sales volume rate for the fourth quarter of 2016 of 3,658 Boe/d. We have a 2017 capital budget of $3.0 million to $5.0 million for the Mid-Continent region.
Dorcheat Macedonia. In the Dorcheat Macedonia Field, we average an approximate 89% working interest and an approximate 74% net revenue interest on all producing wells. The majority of our acreage is held by unitization or production. Our production during 2016 was approximately 3,485 Boe/d (3,895 Boe/d sales volumes). During the fourth quarter of 2016, our production was 3,173 Boe/d (3,583 Boe/d sales volumes). Our proved reserves in this field are approximately 11,604 MBoe. Due to the Company having no plans to drill within the Mid-Continent region, we wrote off all 96 PUD locations that were previously recorded. 
Other Mid-Continent. We own additional interests in the McKamie Patton Field in the Mid-Continent region near the Dorcheat Macedonia Field. As of December 31, 2016, our estimated proved reserves were approximately 1,112 MBoe, and sales volumes during 2016 were approximately 168 Boe/d. During the fourth quarter of 2016, our production was 76 Boe/d.
Gas Processing Facilities. Our Mid-Continent gas processing facilities are located in Lafayette and Columbia counties in Arkansas and are strategically located to serve our production in the region. Our McKamie Gas Plant has been idle since 2015 and our Dorcheat Macedonia Field Gas Plant has a current capacity of 24 MMcf/d with 54,000 gallons per day of 
15

associated NGL capacity. Our ownership of these facilities and related gathering pipeline provides us with the benefit of controlling processing and compression of our natural gas production.
Reserves
Estimated Proved Reserves
The summary data with respect to our estimated proved reserves presented below has been prepared in accordance with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities. Our reserve estimates do not include probable or possible reserves, categories which SEC rules do permit us to disclose in public reports. Our estimated proved reserves for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were determined using the preceding twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices. For a definition of proved reserves under the SEC rules, please see the Glossary of Oil and Natural Gas Terms included in the beginning of this report.
Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and estimates for undeveloped properties are more imprecise than reserve estimates for producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, these estimates are expected to change as new information becomes available. The PV-10 values shown in the following table are not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. Neither prices nor costs have been escalated. The actual quantities and present values of our estimated proved reserves may vary from what we have estimated. 
The table below summarizes our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 for each of the regions and currently producing fields in which we operate. The proved reserve estimates as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are based on reports prepared by our internal corporate reservoir engineering group, of which 100% were audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), our third-party independent reserve engineers. For more information regarding our independent reserve engineers, please see Independent Reserve Engineers below. The information in the following table is not intended to represent the current market value of our proved reserves nor does it give any effect to or reflect our commodity derivatives or current commodity prices.

(1) | Proved reserves were calculated using the preceding twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices, which were $42.75 per Bbl WTI and $2.48 per MMBtu HH, $50.28 per Bbl WTI and $2.59 per MMBtu HH, and $94.99 per Bbl WTI and $4.35 per MMBtu HH for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Adjustments were made for location and grade.


(2) | Determined using the ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil.

Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. Proved undeveloped reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic productivity at greater distances. 
Proved undeveloped locations in our December 31, 2016 reserve report are included in our development plan and are scheduled to be drilled within five years from their initial proved booking date. The Company’s management evaluated the proved undeveloped drilling plan using NYMEX strip prices, the liquidation model for general and administrative costs, the cash from the rights offering as contemplated in the RSA and the cash flows from existing properties. The Company's PUD conversion was 3%, 16% and 21% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company suspended all drilling and completion activities after the first quarter of 2016; as such, 2016 was deemed an anomaly to the Company's PUD conversion standards. The Company currently intends to operate a one-rig program upon emergence from bankruptcy and fully anticipates being able to convert the remaining Rocky Mountain region PUDs within the allotted five-year window assuming drilling and completion activities resumes in the second quarter of 2017. The Company wrote off 100% of its PUDs within the Mid-Continent region as there are no current funded commitments to drill within the region as of December 31, 2016. The reliable technologies used to establish our proved reserves are a combination of pressure performance, geologic mapping, offset productivity, electric logs, and production data.
Estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were 90.7 MMBoe, a 10% decrease from estimated proved reserves of 101.3 MMBoe at December 31, 2015. Approximately 86% of our December 31, 2016 proved reserves are attributed to the Rocky Mountain region, and 99.7% of the Rocky Mountain proved reserves in turn are attributed to the Wattenberg Field. The 
17

net decrease in our reserves of 10.6 MMBoe is the result of 2016 production of 7.8 MMBoe coupled with writing off 16.4 MMBoe of PUDs and 1.9 MMBoe of other engineering revisions offset by additions in extensions, discoveries and infills of 10.8 MMBoe and net positive cost revisions (reserve prices less drilling and completion costs and LOE) of 4.7 MMBoe. 
The 10.8 MMBoe addition in extensions, discoveries and infills is primarily the result of completing five operated and six non-operated unproved horizontal locations in the Niobrara formation that were in progress at year-end 2015, and drilling and completing three non-operated unproved horizontal wells and one operated unproved vertical well in the Niobrara formation in the Wattenberg Field during 2016, and adding 42 infill PUD locations near existing central processing facilities (“CPFs”). These infill locations offset PDP wells drilled prior to 2016. In the engineering revision category, 38 proved undeveloped locations were written off because they were not in close proximity to existing CPFs or CPFs that were planned to be built in 2016 but were not due to liquidity contraints. New drilling in 2017 will begin around the existing CPF's, as they can be hooked up immediately upon completion. For the year ending December 31, 2016, approximately 85% of the Company's development drilling in the Wattenberg Field was in the Niobrara formation, 15% in the Codell. The majority of the proved undeveloped locations are spaced on 80 acres within each bench. Thirty-six of the Niobrara locations are planned to be drilled on 80/40 geometry. An 80/40 well is where the locations in one formation are spaced on 80 acre units, while the lower locations, also spaced 80 acres apart, are offset 40 acres from the bench above.
Total Company positive engineering revisions as of December 31, 2016, were 28,625 Mboe, of which 32,899 Mboe were related to positive reserve changes in the Wattenberg Field and 4,416 Mboe were related to negative reserve changes in the Dorcheat Macedonia Field. The overall positive engineering revision is offset by a negative pricing revision of 39,222 Mboe in the Wattenberg Field and 2,778 Mboe in the Dorcheat Macedonia Field. The negative pricing revision of 42,143 Mboe for the Company resulted from a decrease in average commodity price from $50.28 per Bbl WTI and $2.59 per MMBTU HH for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $42.75 per Bbl WTI and $2.48 per MMBTU HH for the year ended December 31, 2016. The majority of the positive revisions in the Wattenberg Field resulted from a combination of decreased drilling and completion costs and a continued decrease in the LOE which had begun in 2015. The total proved undeveloped location count in the Wattenberg Field is 210 (226 standard reach lateral equivalents) and was 204 as of December 31, 2015. Our five-year plans include the drilling of these proved undeveloped locations. The 2017 drilling program included in the year-end 2016 reserves is a one-rig program estimated to convert 25% of our year end 2016 proved undeveloped reserves in the Wattenberg Field. There are nine horizontal proved undeveloped locations in the Wattenberg Field that would expire in 2017 if they are not drilled this year. If we begin drilling in the second quarter of 2017, operate a single-rig program in 2017 and 2018, add one additional rig for six months in 2019 and revert to a one-rig program thereafter, all remaining PUD locations will be developed within their five-year windows. The PUD locations in the Dorcheat Macedonia Field were all demoted because they would not be drilled within their five-year window under the current drilling plan, which is focused on the Wattenberg Field.
Total Company positive engineering revisions as of December 31, 2015, were 37,174 Mboe, of which 30,086 Mboe (81%) related to reserve changes in the Wattenberg Field. This positive engineering revision was offset by a negative pricing revision of 21,417 Mboe in the Wattenberg Field. The majority of the positive revisions in the Wattenberg Field resulted from a combination of decreased drilling and completion costs, $3.0 million per standard reach lateral well as of December 31, 2015 compared to $4.2 million at December 31, 2014, a 29% decrease, and an increase in productivity from horizontal proved developed producing wells, which increased the offsetting proved undeveloped reserves. The increase in PDP reserves was primarily attributed to the installation of infrastructure in the east side of our Wattenberg Field acreage, which removed the producing constraint that inhibited productivity over the prior two years of development in that area. Another significant contribution to the positive reserve revision in the Wattenberg Field results from a contract change as of January 1, 2015, which gives our Company ownership of the natural gas liquids from our gas production. This conversion from two-stream (wet gas and oil) to three-stream (dry gas, natural gas liquids and oil) added 8,560 Mboe to our proved reserves as of December 31, 2015. With the addition of 45 horizontal proved undeveloped locations in the Wattenberg Field to the proved reserves at December 31, 2015, the total proved undeveloped location count was 204 (220 standard reach lateral equivalents) and was 226 as of December 31, 2014. A negative pricing revision of 28,810 Mboe for the Company resulted from a decrease in average commodity price from $94.99 per Bbl WTI and $4.35 per MMBTU HH for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $50.28 per Bbl WTI and $2.59 per MMBTU HH for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2014 were 89.5 MMBoe, a 28% increase from estimated proved reserves of 69.8 MMBoe at December 31, 2013. The net increase in reserves of 19.7 MMBoe was the result of additions in extensions and discoveries of 20.2 MMBoe, primarily due to the development of the Niobrara B and C benches and the Codell formations in the Wattenberg Field, coupled with a net positive revision of 7.1 MMBoe (engineering and pricing) and net acquisitions (acquisitions less divestitures) of 0.8 MMBoe offset by 8.4 MMBoe in production. The addition in extension and discoveries was primarily the result of drilling and completing 99 unproved horizontal locations (including 12 non-operated) in the Niobrara and the Codell formations in the Wattenberg Field during 2014 and the addition of 37 new horizontal proved undeveloped locations directly offsetting new wells brought online in 2014. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 70% of 
18

our horizontal development in the Wattenberg Field was in the Niobrara B formation, the majority of which was on 80-acre spacing. The net positive engineering revision was primarily the result of adding new Niobrara B proved undeveloped locations on 80-acre spacing, directly offsetting economic proved producing Niobrara B wells drilled prior to 2014, diagonal offsets to economic Niobrara B proved producing wells and a relatively small number of locations greater than one offset to economic Niobrara B proved producing wells but within developed areas and surrounded by Niobrara B proved producing wells. A total of 119 horizontal proved undeveloped locations were added to the proved reserves at December 31, 2014 of which 86 (72%) were direct offsets to economic proved producing wells (drilled in 2014 or prior to 2014), 21 (18%) were direct offsets in a diagonal pattern to economic proved producing wells and 12 (10%) were greater than one offset from economic proved producing wells. The reasonable certainty of the reserves associated with the latter two categories of proved undeveloped locations was based on analysis of the immediate surrounding productivity of the Niobrara B bench and detailed geologic mapping. All Niobrara proved undeveloped locations were spaced on 80 acres. The positive engineering revision was offset by a small negative performance revision of approximately 540 MBoe. A negative pricing revision of 0.25 MMBoe resulted from a decrease in average commodity price from $96.91 per Bbl WTI and $3.67 per MMBTU HH for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $94.99 per Bbl WTI and $4.35 per MMBTU HH for the year ended December 31, 2014.
Reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure
PV-10 is derived from the Standardized Measure, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV-10 is a computation of the Standardized Measure on a pre-tax basis. PV-10 is equal to the Standardized Measure at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10%. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties. PV-10, however, is not a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Neither our PV-10 measure or the Standardized Measure purport to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves.
The following table provides a reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

 | December 31, 
 | 2016 | | 2015 | 2014
 | (in millions)
PV-10 | $ | 276.9 | | $ | 327.8 | $ | 1,340.5 | 
Present value of future income taxes discounted at 10%(1) | | — | | | — | | (233.1 | )
Standardized Measure | $ | 276.9 | | $ | 327.8 | $ | 1,107.4 | 

____________________________
(1) The tax basis of our oil and gas properties as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 provides more tax deduction than income generated from our oil and gas properties when the reserve estimates were prepared using $42.75 per Bbl WTI and $2.48 per MMBTU HH and $50.28 per Bbl WTI and $2.59 per MMBTU HH, respectively.

End of year | 40,057 | | | 49,184 | | 43,246 | 

At December 31, 2016, our proved undeveloped reserves were 40,057 MBoe, all of which are scheduled to be drilled within five years of their initial proved booking date. During 2016, the Company converted 3% of its proved undeveloped 
19

reserves (seven gross wells representing net reserves of 1,352 MBoe) at a cost of $16.2 million. Our 2016 capital program was shut down after the first quarter, and no proved undeveloped locations were added as a result of drilling. The net decrease in our PUD reserves was mainly the result of demoting 7.8 MMBoe of PUDs in the Mid-Continent region, as drilling is now focused entirely on the Wattenberg Field. Thirty-eight Wattenberg proved undeveloped locations that were not in areas with existing CPF's were demoted and were replaced with 42 infill proved undeveloped locations that are near existing CPFs. Current plans are to begin drilling the new and existing proved undeveloped locations within close proximity to existing CPFs upon emergence from bankruptcy.
At December 31, 2015, our proved undeveloped reserves were 49,184 MBoe, all of which were scheduled to be drilled within five years of their initial proved booking date. During 2015, the Company converted 16% of its proved undeveloped reserves (52 gross wells representing net reserves of 6,994 MBoe) at a cost of $121.0 million. Executing our 2015 capital program resulted in the addition of 2,308 MBoe (17 gross wells) in proved undeveloped reserves in the Wattenberg Field. A small acquisition within the field limits of the Dorcheat Macedonia Field added 14 gross proved undeveloped locations and 1,541 MBoe to our reserves. The positive engineering revision of 9,083 MBoe was primarily the result of adding 28 gross new proved undeveloped locations in the Wattenberg Field on 80-acre spacing, the majority directly offsetting economic proved producing wells drilled prior to 2015, and an increase in proved undeveloped reserves in the eastern portion of the Wattenberg Field resulting from increased productivity due to the installation of infrastructure, which eliminated a production constraint thereby allowing productivity to rise, proved developed reserves to increase, and associated proved undeveloped reserves to increase by an estimated 3.0 MMBoe.
At December 31, 2014, our proved undeveloped reserves were 43,246 MBoe, all of which were scheduled to be drilled within five years of their initial proved booking date. During 2014, the Company converted 21% of its proved undeveloped reserves (58 gross wells representing net reserves of 7,791 MBoe) at a cost of $116.9 million. Executing our 2014 capital program resulted in the addition of 5,596 MBoe (45 gross wells) in proved undeveloped reserves. The positive engineering revision of 7,838 MBoe was primarily the result of adding 49 new proved undeveloped locations in the Wattenberg Field on 80-acre spacing, directly offsetting economic proved producing wells drilled prior to 2014, 21 diagonal offsets to economic proved producing wells and 12 gross proved undeveloped locations positioned greater than one offset to economic proved producing wells but within developed areas and surrounded by proved producing wells. Also included in the revision category was the removal from proved undeveloped locations of 15 horizontal locations in the Wattenberg Field that were no longer spaced on 80 acres following the 2014 capital drilling program and all of the vertical proved undeveloped locations in the Wattenberg Field that have been replaced by horizontal wells or are expected to be replaced in the future. Proved undeveloped locations remaining in the category from December 31, 2013 received a downward revision of 214 Mboe.
Internal controls over reserves estimation process
Our policies regarding internal controls over the recording of reserves estimates require reserves to be in compliance with SEC definitions and guidance and prepared in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The Company’s Reserves Committee reviews significant reserve changes on an annual basis and our third-party independent reserve engineers, NSAI, is engaged by and has direct access to the Reserves Committee. NSAI audited 100% of our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Responsibility for compliance in reserves estimation is delegated to our internal corporate reservoir engineering group managed by John E. Vorwerk. Mr. Vorwerk is our Corporate Reserves Manager. Mr. Vorwerk attended the Colorado School of Mines and graduated in 1976 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Geological Engineering. He also received a Master of Science degree in Mineral Economics from the Colorado School of Mines in 1991. Mr. Vorwerk has been in the petroleum industry for 41 years, and has been a Registered Professional Engineer since 1981. He has been directly involved in evaluations and the estimation of reserves and resources, and has worked in the corporate reserves function for over 21 years. He has been employed at Bonanza for three years, and has been the Corporate Reserves Manager for the past two and a half years. Collectively with Mr. Vorwerk, our internal corporate reservoir engineering group has over 85 years of industry experience. 
Our technical team works with our banking syndicate members for a valuation of our reserves by the banks in our lending group and their engineers in determining the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility.
Independent Reserve Engineers
The reserves estimates for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 shown herein have been independently audited by NSAI, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-2699. Within NSAI, the technical persons primarily responsible for auditing the 
20

estimates set forth in the NSAI audit letter incorporated herein are Mr. Dan Paul Smith and Mr. John G. Hattner. Mr. Smith, a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (No. 49093), has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 1980 and has over 7 years of prior industry experience. He graduated from Mississippi State University in 1973 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Petroleum Engineering. Mr. Hattner, a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas, Geology (No. 559), has been practicing consulting petroleum geoscience at NSAI since 1991, and has over 11 years of prior industry experience. He graduated from University of Miami, Florida, in 1976 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Geology; from Florida State University in 1980 with a Master of Science Degree in Geological Oceanography; and from Saint Mary's College of California in 1989 with a Master of Business Administration Degree. Both technical principals meet or exceed the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; both are proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines.
Production, Revenues and Price History
The recent collapse in oil prices was among the most severe on record. The daily NYMEX WTI oil spot price went from a high of $107.62 per Bbl in 2014 to a low of $26.19 per Bbl in 2016. The drop in crude oil pricing was due in large part to increased production levels, crude oil inventories and recessed global economic growth. Oil prices are also impacted by real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil producing regions, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, weather and the global economy. Gas prices were under downward pressure during 2015 and the first half of 2016 due to excess supply leading to higher levels of gas in storage when compared to the five-year average. These depressed oil prices lead to dramatic cuts in the exploration and production budgets which incrementally reduced oil supply, and have helped prices rebound off of the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016. With better pricing in the beginning of 2017, compared to 2016, we expect increased industry activity which could moderate the magnitude of price increases throughout the year. 
Sensitivity Analysis
If oil and natural gas SEC prices declined by 10%, our proved reserve volumes would decrease by 8% and our PV-10 value as of December 31, 2016 would decrease by approximately 42% or $116.2 million. The PV-10 value of our Rocky Mountain region, primarily our Wattenberg assets, would decrease by 48% or $97.5 million.
The Company incurred an immaterial impairment of proved properties of $10.0 million on its Mid-Continent assets resulting from a received bid while the assets were held for sale, but these assets are no longer held for sale as of December 31, 2016. We do not anticipate triggering additional impairments in 2017 when analyzing price changes only. However, upon emergence from bankruptcy, there could be additional impairments due to the assigned enterprise value of the Company. 
Production
The following table sets forth information regarding oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production, sales prices, and production costs for the periods indicated. For additional information on price calculations, please see information set forth in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Principal Customers
Three of our customers, Silo Energy, LLC, Lion Oil Trading & Transportation, Inc., and Duke Energy Field Services comprised 50%, 18%, and 14%, respectively, of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. No other single non-affiliated customer accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas sales in 2016. We believe the loss of any one customer would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations because there are numerous potential customers for our production.

Delivery Commitments
We have entered into two purchase agreements to deliver a fixed determinable quantity of crude oil within the Wattenberg Field. The first agreement took effect during the second quarter of 2015 for 12,580 gross barrels per day over an initial five-year term. The second agreement took effect during the fourth quarter of 2016 for 15,000 gross barrels per day over an initial seven-year term. The aggregate financial commitment fee for both agreements is approximately $437.1 million at December 31, 2016. While the volume commitment may be met with Company volumes or third-party volumes, the Company has been required to make periodic deficiency payments for current shortfalls in delivering the minimum monthly volume commitments. Amending one of these agreements and terminating the other is contemplated within our bankruptcy case. Please refer to Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion.

Undeveloped acreage
We critically review and consider at-risk leasehold with attention to our ability either to convert term leasehold to held-by-production status or obtain term extensions. We focus primarily on the core fields of development where reserve bookings are prevalent. Decisions to let leasehold expire generally relate to areas out of our core fields of development or do not pose material impacts to development plans or reserves.

Capital Expenditure Budget
Upon emergence from bankruptcy, management currently intends to operate a one-rig program, with capital expenditures ranging from $160.0 million to $180.0 million for the time period from May to December 2017. The Wattenberg Field capital budget ranges from $160.0 million to $175.0 million to drill 23 operated standard reach lateral wells and 19 operated extended reach lateral wells. The Wattenberg program will also consist of a modest infrastructure investment as well as participation in economic non-operated wells. The remaining capital budget of $3.0 million to $5.0 million is slated for recompletions within the Mid-Continent region. Actual capital expenditures could vary significantly based on, among other 
24

things, emergence from bankruptcy, approval by the newly appointed board, market conditions, commodity prices, the final amount of the rights offering effectuated pursuant to the RSA, and changes in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility. We have observed evidence of an increase in drilling and completion costs since year-end, which would impact actual capital expenditures.
Title to Properties
Our properties are subject to customary royalty interests, overriding royalty interests, obligations incident to operating agreements, liens for current taxes and other industry‑related constraints, including leasehold restrictions. We do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with our use of the properties in the operation of our business. We believe that we have satisfactory title to or rights in all of our producing properties. We undergo thorough title review and receive title opinions from legal counsel before we commence drilling operations, subject to the availability and examination of accurate title records. Although in certain cases, title to our properties is subject to interpretation of multiple conveyances, deeds, reservations, and other constraints, we believe that none of these will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or will materially interfere with the operation of our business.
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies explore for, produce and market oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market the resultant products on a worldwide basis. The primary areas in which we encounter substantial competition are in locating and acquiring desirable leasehold acreage for our drilling and development operations, locating and acquiring attractive producing oil and gas properties, attracting and retaining qualified personnel, and obtaining transportation for the oil and gas we produce in certain regions. There is also competition between producers of oil and gas and other industries producing alternative energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by federal, state and local governments; however, it is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation that may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may, however, substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing gas and oil and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. The effect of these risks cannot be accurately predicted.
Further, oil prices and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other. Because approximately 75% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 were oil and natural gas liquids reserves, our financial results are more sensitive to movements in oil prices. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the daily NYMEX WTI oil spot price ranged from a high of $54.01 per Bbl to a low of $26.19 per Bbl, and the NYMEX natural gas HH spot price ranged from a high of $3.80 per MMBtu to a low of $1.49 per MMBtu. 
Insurance Matters
As is common in the oil and gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because premium costs are considered prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, oil and natural gas production and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes and numerous other laws and regulations. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate properties for oil and natural gas production have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area, and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas wells, and regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and that impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells.
Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations. The regulatory burden on the industry can increase the cost of doing business and negatively affect profitability. Because such laws 
25

and regulations are frequently amended through various rulemakings, it is difficult, and we are often unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states and various municipalities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective and if the outcomes will negatively affect our operations.
We believe that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen incidents may occur or past non-compliance with laws or regulations may be discovered.
Regulation of transportation of oil
Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. Interstate transportation of oil by pipeline is regulated by FERC pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines, including interstate pipelines that transport crude oil and refined products (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”) be just and reasonable and non‑discriminatory and that such rates and terms and conditions of service be filed with FERC.
Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated.
Regulation of transportation and sales of natural gas
Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government, primarily FERC. FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”) and culminated in adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated primarily under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by Congress and by FERC regulations.
FERC issued a series of orders in 1996 and 1997 to implement its open access policies. As a result, the interstate pipelines’ traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas has been greatly reduced and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage service on an open access basis to others who buy and sell natural gas. Although FERC’s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.
The Domenici Barton Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EP Act of 2005”), is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans, and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. Among other matters, the EP Act of 2005 amends the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC. The EP Act of 2005 provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per day for violations of the NGA and increases FERC’s civil penalty authority under the NGPA from $5,000 per violation per day to $1,000,000 per violation per day. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti-market manipulation provision of the EP Act of 2005, and subsequently denied rehearing. The rules make it unlawful: (1) in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation more accessible to natural gas services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The 
26

new anti-market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order 704. The anti-market manipulation rule and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of FERC’s NGA enforcement authority.
Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our costs of getting gas to point of sale locations. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory-take requirements. Although nondiscriminatory-take regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress.
Our sales of natural gas are also subject to requirements under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). The CEA prohibits any person from manipulating or attempting to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce or futures on such commodity. The CEA also prohibits knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of a commodity.
Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete.
Regulation of production
The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the spacing and unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the regulation of well spacing and well density, and procedures for proper plugging and abandonment of wells. The intent of these regulations is to promote the efficient recovery of oil and gas reserves while reducing waste and protecting correlative rights. By collaborating with industry's exploration and development operations, these regulations effectively identify where wells can be drilled, well densities by geologic formation along with the proper spacing and pooling unit size to effectively drain the resources. Operators can apply for exceptions to such regulations including applications to increase well densities to more effectively recover the oil and gas resources. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
We own interests in properties located onshore in three U.S. states. These states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters, including the handling and disposing or discharge of waste materials, the 
27

size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled, and the unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties. 
Regulation of derivatives 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was passed by Congress and signed into law in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for the regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market with the intent to provide greater transparency and reduction of risk between counterparties. The Dodd-Frank Act subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to capital and margin requirements and requires many derivative transactions to be cleared on exchanges. The Dodd-Frank Act provides for a potential exemption from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation
Our natural gas and oil exploration and production operations are subject to numerous stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing safety and health, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection, non-compliance with which can result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and other sanctions, including suspension or cessation of operations. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits before drilling or other regulated activity commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment; govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process; limit or prohibit drilling activities that impact threatened or endangered species or that occur in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier and other protected areas; require some form of remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits; establish specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with regulatory filings. In addition, these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of production.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
Hazardous substances and waste handling
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these potentially “responsible persons” may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We are able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which we act as operator. Notwithstanding our lack of direct control over wells operated by others, the failure of an operator other than us to comply with applicable environmental regulations may, in certain circumstances, be attributed to us. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances but we are not aware of any liabilities for which we may be held responsible that would materially or adversely affect us. 
We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used for numerous years to explore and produce oil and natural gas. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons and wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons and wastes were not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including groundwater contaminated by prior owners or operators), to pay for damages for the loss or impairment of natural resources, and to take measures to prevent future contamination from our operations.
28

In addition, other laws require the reporting on use of hazardous and toxic chemicals. For example, in October 2015, EPA granted, in part, a petition filed by several national environmental advocacy groups to add the oil and gas extraction industry to the list of industries required to report releases of certain “toxic chemicals” under the Toxic Release Inventory (“TRI”) program under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. EPA determined that natural gas processing facilities may be appropriate for addition to TRI applicable facilities and in January 2017, EPA issued a proposed rule to include natural gas processing facilities in the TRI program.
Pipeline safety and maintenance
Pipelines, gathering systems and terminal operations are subject to increasingly strict safety laws and regulations. Both the transportation and storage of refined products and crude oil involve a risk that hazardous liquids may be released into the environment, potentially causing harm to the public or the environment. In turn, such incidents may result in substantial expenditures for response actions, significant government penalties, liability for natural resources damages, and significant business interruption. The U.S. Department of Transportation has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of our pipeline and storage facilities. These regulations contain requirements for the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and the correction of anomalies. These regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans.
There have been recent initiatives to strengthen and expand pipeline safety regulations and to increase penalties for violations. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act was signed into law in early 2012. In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) has issued new rules to strengthen federal pipeline safety enforcement programs. In 2015, PHMSA proposed to expand its regulations in a number of ways, including through the increased regulation of gathering lines, even in rural areas. In 2016, PHMSA increased its regulations to require crude oil sampling and reporting as an offeror and increased its civil penalty structure.
Air emissions
The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including oil and gas operations, and impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Obtaining required air permits can significantly delay the development of certain oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues.
For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules under the CAA that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants programs. With regards to production activities, these final rules require, among other things, the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from three subcategories of fractured and refractured gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted: wildcat (exploratory) and delineation gas wells; low reservoir pressure non-wildcat and non-delineation gas wells; and all “other” fractured and refractured gas wells. These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. The EPA issued revised rules in 2013 and 2014 in response to requests for reconsideration from industry and the environmental community. Most recently, as part of the reconsideration, in May 2016 the EPA issued amendments to the NSPS rules focused on achieving additional methane and volatile organic compound reductions from oil and natural gas operations. Among other things, these amendments impose new requirements for leak detection and repair, control requirements for oil well completions, and additional control requirements for gathering, boosting, and compressor stations. Concurrently with these methane rules, the EPA finalized a new rule regarding source determinations and permitting requirements for the onshore oil and gas industry under the CAA. The EPA also published Control Technique Guidelines aimed at providing states with guidance on Reasonable Achievable Control Technology for the oil and gas industry in areas of ozone non-attainment. 
On October 1, 2015, EPA finalized its rule lowering the existing 75 part per billion ("ppb") national ambient air quality standard ("NAAQS") for ozone under the CAA to 70 ppb. Also in 2015, the State of Colorado received a bump-up in its existing ozone non-attainment status from “marginal” to “moderate.” Oil and natural gas operations in ozone nonattainment areas, including in Colorado, may be subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs. In addition, in February 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s Air Quality Control Commission (“AQCC”) adopted new and revised air quality regulations that impose stringent new requirements to control emissions from existing and new oil and gas facilities in 
29

Colorado. The proposed regulations include new control, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements on oil and gas operators in Colorado. For example, the new regulations impose Storage Tank Emission Management (“STEM”) requirements for certain new and existing storage tanks. The STEM requirements require us to install costly emission control technologies as well as monitoring and recordkeeping programs at most of our new and existing well production facilities. The new Colorado regulations also impose a Leak Detection and Repair (“LDAR”) program for well production facilities and compressor stations. The LDAR program primarily targets hydrocarbon (i.e., methane) emissions from the oil and gas sector in Colorado and represents a significant new use of state authority regarding these emissions.
Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could be significant. 
Climate change
In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources that include potential major sources of GHG emissions. In June 2014, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, No. 12‑1146. The Supreme Court upheld part of the EPA’s GHG-related regulations but struck down other portions of the rules. Specifically, the Supreme Court ruled that sources subject to the PSD or Title V programs because of non-GHG emissions could still potentially be subject to certain “best available control technology” requirements applicable to their GHG emissions. Under the Court’s opinion, sources subject to the PSD or Title V programs due solely to their GHG emissions, however, can no longer be subject to EPA’s GHG permitting requirements. The D.C. Circuit issued an amendment judgment following remand, and EPA intends to conduct future rulemaking to make revisions conforming to the court rulings. In May 2016, the EPA also finalized a rule regarding source determination, including defining the term “adjacent” under the CAA, which affects how major sources, including GHG major sources, are regulated. These EPA rulemakings will have nominal effect on our operations because the rule clarified our existing presumption on “adjacent" and presents no conflict with the State of Colorado regulations. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. We are monitoring GHG emissions from our operations in accordance with the GHG emissions reporting rule.
Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. In addition, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. Most recently, the EPA finalized rules to further reduce GHG emissions, primarily from coal-fired power plants, under its Clean Power Plan. The Clean Power Plan and associated BLM Venting and Flaring rule may become subject to the Congressional Review Act given the focus of the Trump administration on reduced regulation. If fully implemented, the Clean Power Plan could affect the demand for products we supply or otherwise affect our operations. If Congress undertakes comprehensive tax reform in the coming year, it is possible that such reform may include a carbon tax, which could impose additional direct costs on operations and reduce demand for refined products. In January 2015, the EPA announced a comprehensive strategy intended to further reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, which already has resulted in the final May 2016 amendments to the 2012 NSPS and the related source determination rule noted above and may result in additional regulation. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. Severe limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.
Water discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act or the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into certain surface waters. In 2016, the definition of waters of the United States was substantially expanded which may have effect on our current and future operations. The Trump administration has identified this rule change as one that may be rescinded using the Congressional Review Act or other means. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on‑site storage of significant quantities of oil. As properties are acquired, we determine the need for new or updated SPCC plans and, where necessary, will develop or update such plans to implement physical and operation controls, the costs of which are not expected to be material. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army 
30

Corps of Engineers adopted a new regulatory definition of "waters of the U.S.," which governs which waters and wetlands are subject to the CWA. This final rule has been stayed pending the resolution of ongoing litigation, and in February 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing EPA to begin rescinding or revising this final rule. In June 2016, EPA finalized new CWA pretreatment standards that would prevent onshore unconventional oil and natural gas wells from discharging wastewater pollutants to publicly-owned treatment facilities.
Endangered Species Act
The federal Endangered Species Act restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. A final rule amending how critical habitat is designated was finalized in 2016. Some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.
Employee health and safety
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (the “OSH Act”), and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In 2016, there were substantial revisions to the OSHA regulations that may have impact to our operations. These changes include among other items; record keeping and reporting, revised crystalline silica standard, naming oil and gas as a high hazard industry, requirements for a safety and health management system. In addition, the OSH Act’s hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations, and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Hydraulic fracturing
Regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing. We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning health, safety, and environmental protection. Government authorities frequently add to those requirements, and both oil and gas development generally and hydraulic fracturing specifically are receiving increasing regulatory attention. Our operations utilize hydraulic fracturing, an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and natural gas wells in low-permeability formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, proppant, and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate hydrocarbon production.
States have historically regulated oil and gas exploration and production activity, including hydraulic fracturing. State governments in the areas where we operate have adopted or are considering adopting additional requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing that could restrict its use in certain circumstances or make it more costly to utilize. Such measures may address any risk to drinking water, the potential for hydrocarbon migration and disclosure of the chemicals used in fracturing. Colorado, for example, comprehensively updated its oil and gas regulations in 2008 and adopted significant additional amendments in 2011 and 2013. Among other things, the updated and amended regulations require operators to reduce methane emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing, compile and report additional information regarding well bore integrity, publicly disclose the chemical ingredients used in hydraulic fracturing, increase the minimum distance between occupied structures and oil and gas wells, undertake additional mitigation for nearby residents, and implement additional groundwater testing. In 2014, the State enacted legislation to increase the potential sanctions for statutory, regulatory and other violations. Among other things, this legislation and its implementing regulations mandate monetary penalties for certain types of violations, require a penalty to be assessed for each day of violation and significantly increase the maximum daily penalty amount. Most recently, Colorado adopted rules imposing additional permitting requirements for certain large scale facilities in urban mitigation areas and additional notice requirements prior to engaging in operations near certain municipalities. Any enforcement actions or requirements of additional studies or investigations by governmental authorities where we operate could increase our operating costs and cause delays or interruptions of our operations.
The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and comparable state statutes may restrict the disposal, treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development. Subsurface emplacement of fluids, primarily via disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery (“EOR”) wells, is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that, in some cases, include the state oil and gas regulatory or the state’s environmental authority. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Underground Injection Control provisions of the SDWA to expressly exclude certain hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection,” but disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids and produced water or their injection for EOR is not excluded. Congress has considered bills to repeal this SDWA exemption for hydraulic fracturing. If enacted, hydraulic fracturing operations could be required to meet additional federal permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to 
31

certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, meet plugging and abandonment requirements, and provide additional public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process.
Federal agencies are also considering additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has published guidance for issuing underground injection permits that would regulate hydraulic fracturing using diesel fuel. This guidance eventually could encourage other regulatory authorities to adopt permitting and other restrictions on the use of hydraulic fracturing. In addition, on October 21, 2011, the EPA announced its intention to propose regulations under the CWA to regulate wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas production. As noted above, in June 2016, EPA finalized regulations that address discharges of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works. The EPA is also collecting information as part of a nationwide study into the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. The EPA issued a progress report regarding the study in December 2012, which described generally the continuing focus of the study, but did not provide any data, findings, or conclusions regarding the safety of hydraulic fracturing operations. In June 2015, the EPA released a draft assessment of the potential impacts to drinking water resources from hydraulic fracturing. The Agency will finalize the assessment following public comment and review. The results of this study could result in additional regulations, which could lead to operational burdens similar to those described above. The EPA also has initiated a stakeholder and potential rulemaking process under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) to obtain data on chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has not indicated when it intends to issue a proposed rule, but it issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May 2014, seeking public comment on a variety of issues related to the TSCA rulemaking. As noted above, in January 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rule to include natural gas processing facilities in the TRI program. The United States Department of the Interior also finalized a new rule regulating hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. This rule has been stayed pending the outcome of ongoing litigation. In early 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) proposed rules related to further controlling the venting and flaring of natural gas on BLM land which the U.S. House of Representative passed resolution to repeal. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has proposed stricter standards for worker exposure to silica, which would apply to use of sand as a proppant for hydraulic fracturing. In addition, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice, Environment and Natural Resources Division released a Memorandum of Understanding announcing an inter-agency effort to increase the enforcement of workplace safety crimes that occur in conjunction with environmental crimes.
Apart from these ongoing federal and state initiatives, local governments are adopting new requirements on hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas operations. Voters in Colorado have proposed or advanced initiatives restricting or banning oil and gas development in Colorado. Any successful bans or moratoriums where we operate could increase the costs of our operations, impact our profitability, and even prevent us from drilling in certain locations.
At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of recent state and local actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations affecting hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of future federal, state or local laws or implementing regulations imposing new environmental obligations on, or otherwise limiting, our operations could make it more difficult and more expensive to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase our costs of compliance and doing business, delay or prevent the development of certain resources (including especially shale formations that are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing), or alter the demand for and consumption of our products and services. We cannot assure you that any such outcome would not be material, and any such outcome could have a material and adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.
Our use of hydraulic fracturing. We use hydraulic fracturing as a means to maximize production of oil and gas from formations having low permeability such that natural flow is restricted. Fracture stimulation has been used for decades in both the Rocky Mountains and Mid-Continent. 
Typical hydraulic fracturing treatments are made up of water, chemical additives and sand. We utilize major hydraulic fracturing service companies who track and report additive chemicals that are used in fracturing as required by the appropriate government agencies. Each of these companies fracture stimulate a multitude of wells for the industry each year. 
We periodically review our plans and policies regarding oil and gas operations, including hydraulic fracturing, in order to minimize any potential environmental impact. Our operations are subject to close supervision by state and federal regulators (including the BLM with respect to federal acreage), who frequently inspect our fracturing operations.
National Environmental Policy Act
Natural gas and oil exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, to evaluate major 
32

agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency prepares an Environmental Assessment to evaluate the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project. If impacts are considered significant, the agency will prepare a more detailed environmental impact study that is made available for public review and comment. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. The vast majority of our exploration and production activities are not on federal lands. This environmental impact assessment process has the potential to delay or limit, or increase the cost of, the development of natural gas and oil projects on federal lands. Authorizations under NEPA also are subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can delay or halt projects.
Oil Pollution Act
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the U.S. The OPA and its associated regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. A “responsible party” under the OPA includes owners and operators of certain onshore facilities from which a release may affect waters of the U.S. The OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation. If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by the OPA. The OPA imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill.
State laws
Our properties located in Colorado are subject to the authority of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (the “COGCC”), as well as other state agencies. The COGCC recently approved new rules regarding minimum setbacks, groundwater monitoring, large-scale facilities in urban mitigation areas, and public notice requirements that are intended to prevent or mitigate environmental impacts of oil and gas development and include the permitting of wells. Over the past several years, the COGCC has also approved new rules regarding various other matters, including wellbore integrity, hydraulic fracturing, well control waste management, spill reporting, and an increase in potential sanctions for COGCC rule’s violations. Depending on how these and any other new rules are applied, they could add substantial increases in well costs for our Colorado operations. The rules could also impact our ability and extend the time necessary to obtain drilling permits, which would create substantial uncertainty about our ability to meet future drilling plans and thus production and capital expenditure targets. The State of Colorado also created a task force to make recommendations for minimizing land use and other conflicts concerning the location of new oil and gas facilities. In February 2015, the task force concluded their deliberations and agreed upon nine consensus proposals which were sent to Governor Hickenlooper for his review. Three of the proposals require further legislative action, while the other six proposals require rulemaking or other regulatory action.  The proposals support (i) a senate bill that would postpone expiration of recently adopted regulations, regarding air emissions; (ii) tasking the COGCC with crafting new rules related to siting of “large-scale” pads and facilities; (iii) requiring the industry to provide advance information about development plans to local governments; (iv) improving the COGCC’s local government liaison and designee programs; (v) adding 11 full-time staffers to the COGCC; (vi) bolstering the inspection staff and equipment for monitoring oil and gas facility air emissions and setting up a hotline for citizen health complaints at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment; (vii) creating a statewide oil and gas information clearinghouse; (viii) studying ways to ameliorate the impact of oil and gas truck traffic and (ix) creating a compliance-assistance program at the COGCC to help operators comply with the state's changing rules and ensure consistent enforcement of rules by state inspectors. A number of additional proposals did not receive sufficient task force support to be included with the nine consensus proposals, but may nevertheless be forwarded to the Governor as well.
In 2015 and into 2016, COGCC implemented two of these recommendations (in particular items (ii) and (iii) identified above). With respect to recommendation (ii) above, the COGCC finalized rules to permit “large-scale facilities” in “urban mitigation areas.” With respect to recommendation (iii) above, the COGCC finalized rules to require operators to provide certain municipalities with public notice prior to engaging in operations.
In 2016, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that the cities of Fort Collins and Longmont do not have authority to ban oil and gas operations within their jurisdictional limits. Although we do not own or operate within any of these municipal areas, the Colorado Supreme Court decision has bearing on our ability to continue to operate in Colorado. Further, Weld County completed implementation of a local government permitting process for land use approval. We do not expect that the local government issues will have any material impact on our operations.
