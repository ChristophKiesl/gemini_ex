Item 1. Business.
Introduction



We are a blank check company incorporated on December 30, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “business combination”). We have identified a target for our business combination, as described below under “—Proposed Business Combination.” If the proposed business combination is not completed, we will continue to try to identify suitable targets for our business combination. Although we are not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a business combination, we have primarily been focusing our search to date on the restaurant, hospitality, and related sectors in North America. We have neither engaged in any operations unrelated to our proposed business combination, our search for business combination candidates nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, we are a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.



On March 18, 2021, we closed our Initial Public Offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 20,000,000 units (the “Units”) at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $200.0 million. We granted the underwriters in the Initial Public Offering a 45-day option to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any. The underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in part, and on March 26, 2021, purchased 2,233,687 additional Units (the “Over-Allotment”) at the Initial Public Offering price at $10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds of approximately $22.3 million.



Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we completed the private placement (the “private placement”) of 4,000,000 warrants (each, a “private placement warrant” and collectively, the “private placement warrants”) at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant to FAST Sponsor II LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating proceeds of $6.0 million. We consummated a second closing of the private placement simultaneously with the closing of the Over-Allotment on March 26, 2021, for an additional 297,825 private placement warrants at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating proceeds of approximately $0.4 million.



On January 6, 2021, the Sponsor purchased 5,750,000 shares of our Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “founder shares”), for an aggregate price of $25,000. The initial stockholders agreed to forfeit up to 750,000 founder shares to the extent that the over-allotment option was not exercised in full by the underwriters, so that the founder shares would represent 20.0% of our issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. On March 26, 2021, the underwriter exercised the option to purchase 2,233,687 additional units, for a total of 22,233,687 Units and the Sponsor forfeited 191,578 shares of Class B common stock.



Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Over-Allotment, and the private placement, $222.3 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering, the Over-Allotment and of the private placement warrants in the private placement were placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) located in the United States at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. “government securities,” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.



As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $552,000 in our operating bank account, approximately $2.3 million of interest available to pay for franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) and a working capital deficit of approximately $2.1 million (not taking into account approximately $93,000 of tax liabilities that may be withdrawn from the Trust Account and excluding a working capital loan from our Sponsor. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $898,000 had been withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay taxes.



As of March 23, 2023, we had approximately $674,537.48 in our operating bank account, $73,477,336.40 in our Trust Account (including approximately $1,372,246.40 of interest available to pay for franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses)).

Charter Amendments and Redemptions



On March 10, 2023, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware three amendments to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation:

● | An amendment to change the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from March 18, 2023 the (“Current Outside Date”) to June 18, 2023, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, by resolution of the Company’s board, to elect to further extend this date in one-month increments, up to four additional times (the “Extension Amendment”);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An amendment to provide for the right of a holder of Class B common stock of the Company to convert into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing of a business combination at the election of the holder (the “Founder Share Amendment”); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An amendment to remove the limitation that the Company shall not consummate a business combination if it would cause the Company’s net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and the limitation that the Company shall not redeem public shares that would cause the Company’s net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (the “Redemption Limitation Amendment”).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Company’s stockholders approved the Extension Amendment, Founder Share Amendment and Redemption Limitation Amendment at a special meeting of stockholders of the Company on March 3, 2023. The Extension Amendment, Founder Share Amendment and Redemption Limitation Amendment are filed as Exhibit 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 hereto.



In connection with the Extension Amendment, 15,098,178 shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding Class A common stock were redeemed for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.1498 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $153.24 million. Immediately following such redemptions, 7,135,509 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock remained outstanding and approximately $72.42 million remained in our Trust Account before the deposit of funds by us as described in the following paragraph.



Also, in connection with approval of the Extension Amendment and the extension of the date by which we must consummate a business combination to June 18, 2023, we caused $750,000, or approximately $0.1051 per share of the Company’s Class A common stock outstanding after giving effect to the redemptions disclosed above, to be deposited in the Trust Account. Such funds were provided by Infinite Acquisitions LLLP pursuant to the Promissory Note with Infinite described below.



Without approval of our public stockholders, we may, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon 2 business days’ advance notice prior to the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable, extend the Extended Date up to four additional times until October 18, 2023, or a total of up to seven months after the Current Outside Date, provided that we deposit into the Trust Account, for each such additional month, an amount determined by multiplying $0.05 by the number of public shares then outstanding, up to a maximum of $250,000, which the Company shall deposit into the trust account at the beginning of each month (the “Monthly Deposit”), for an aggregate deposit of up to $1.75 million (if all additional extensions are exercised). For so long as the Merger Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with its terms and the Business Combination has not been consummated, our Board will extend the Extended Date for the next calendar month.





2







We have entered into an unsecured promissory note (the “Promissory Note”) with Infinite Acquisitions LLLP, a Nevada limited liability limited partnership and currently the holder of the majority of the equity in Falcon’s (“Infinite”), whereby Infinite agreed to lend the Company up to $2 million for the sole purpose of paying the fees and expenses of the Company or the Sponsor incurred or committed to be incurred in furtherance of the Extension, which amount would be sufficient to fund up to approximately $1.5 million of the Company’s potential additional deposits into the trust account. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and repayable in cash, or, at Pubco’s option, in shares of Pubco Class A Common Stock at a conversion price of $10.00 per share, at the effective time of the Business Combination and will be forgiven without payment if the Merger Agreement is terminated. Any additional deposits into the trust account beyond the amount covered under the Promissory Note are expected to be funded from the Company’s working capital account, which may be funded by working capital loans from our Sponsor, that would either be repaid upon consummation of a business combination or, at the Sponsor’s discretion, be converted into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant.



With respect to the regulation of special purpose acquisition companies like our Company (“SPACs”), on March 30, 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules (the “SPAC Rule Proposals”) relating to, among other items, the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), including a proposed rule that would provide SPACs a safe harbor from treatment as an investment company if they satisfy certain conditions that limit a SPAC’s duration, asset composition, business purpose and activities. There is currently uncertainty concerning the applicability of the Investment Company Act to SPACs. It is possible that a claim could be made that we have been operating as an unregistered investment company, including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, based on the current views of the SEC. While the funds in the Trust Account have, since the Initial Public Offering, been held only in U.S. government securities within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or money market funds meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, to mitigate the risk of being viewed as operating as an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act), on March 13, 2023, we instructed Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the trustee, to liquidate the U.S. government securities or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing bank deposit account until the earlier of consummation of our initial business combination or the Company’s liquidation. Interest on bank deposit accounts is variable and such accounts currently yield interest of approximately 3.5% per annum. Following a liquidation of the Trust Account assets, if we are unable to achieve more than minimal interest on the funds held in the Trust Account, the dollar amount Public Stockholders would otherwise receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company may be less than if the assets in the Trust Account remained in U.S. government securities or money market funds.



Proposed Business Combination



On January 31, 2023, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (as the same may be further amended, modified, supplemented or waived from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Falcon’s Beyond Global, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“Falcon’s”), Falcon’s Beyond Global, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Falcon’s which was formerly known as Palm Holdco, Inc. (“Pubco”), and Palm Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Pubco (“Merger Sub”). The Merger Agreement amended and restated the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 11, 2022, by and among the Company, Falcon’s, Pubco and Merger Sub (as amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated September 13, 2022 as previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities Exchange Commission on September 16, 2022, the “Original Merger Agreement”).



If the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are completed, the business combination will be effected in two steps: (a) at 8:01 a.m., New York City time, on the date immediately following the Closing Date (the “SPAC Merger Effective Time”), the Company will merge with and into Pubco (the “SPAC Merger”), with Pubco surviving as the sole owner of Merger Sub, followed by a contribution by Pubco of all of its cash (except for cash required to pay certain transaction expenses) to Merger Sub to effectuate the “UP-C” structure; and (b) at 8:02 a.m., New York City time, on the date immediately following the SPAC Merger (the “Acquisition Merger Effective Time”), Merger Sub will merge with and into Falcon’s (the “Acquisition Merger,” and collectively with the SPAC Merger, the “Business Combination”), with Falcon’s as the surviving entity of such merger. Following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), the direct interests in Falcon’s will be held by Pubco and the holders of the limited liability company units of Falcon’s (the “Falcon’s Units”) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Business Combination.





3







The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, the following transactions will occur:



(i) On the date that is three business days after the date on which all conditions to Closing have been satisfied or waived by the applicable parties (other than those conditions which can be satisfied only at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at Closing) or such other time and place as may be agreed by Falcon’s and the Company (the “Closing Date”), each share of Class B common stock will convert into one share of Class A common stock (such conversion, the “Class B Exchange”) and shares of Class A common stock for which redemption rights were exercised will be redeemed.



(ii) At the SPAC Merger Effective Time, (a) first, each Unit outstanding immediately prior to the SPAC Merger Effective Time will be automatically separated and the holder thereof will be deemed to hold one share of Class A common stock and one-quarter of one warrant; (b) second, (1) each current share of Class A common stock (except for each share of Class A common stock converted from the Class B common stock pursuant to the Class B Exchange) will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist in exchange (the “Conversion”) for the right to receive (x) 0.5 shares of Pubco’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Pubco Class A Common Stock”) and 0.5 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of Pubco (the “Pubco Series A Preferred Stock”) and (y) 50% of the Additional SPAC Share Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement); (2) each share of Class A common stock converted from the Class B common stock pursuant to the Class B Exchange will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist in exchange for the right to receive (A) one newly issued share of Pubco Class A Common Stock and (B) the applicable portion of any Earnout Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement); and (3) each warrant of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the SPAC Merger Effective Time will be assumed by Pubco on substantially the same terms as were in effect immediately prior to the SPAC Merger Effective Time.



(iii) Immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, following the SPAC Merger, Pubco will contribute to Merger Sub all of the Closing Surviving Corporation Cash (as defined in the Merger Agreement).



(iv) At the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, (a) each issued and outstanding Falcon’s Unit (other than the Cancelled Units and Falcon’s Financing Units (each as defined below)) will be converted into the right to receive (x) a number of shares of Pubco’s non-economic Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Pubco Class B Common Stock”), and a number of limited liability company interests of Falcon’s (the “New Falcon’s Units”), in each case equal to the Acquisition Merger Exchange Number (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (the “Per Unit Consideration”) and (y) the applicable portion of any Earnout Shares and Earnout Units (as defined in the Merger Agreement); (b) each Falcon’s Unit issued in connection with the subscription for and purchase of Falcon’s Units by Infinite Acquisitions LLLP (the “Falcon’s Financing Units”) will be converted into the right to receive (x) the Per Unit Consideration and (y) a number of shares of non-economic Pubco Class B Common Stock and a number of New Falcon’s Units, in each case equal to the Additional Consideration Number (as defined in the Merger Agreement; (c) each Falcon’s Unit held in treasury of Falcon’s as of immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time (collectively, the “Cancelled Units”) will be cancelled without any conversion and no payment or distribution will be made with respect to such Cancelled Units; (d) the units of Merger Sub that are issued and outstanding will be converted into and become (x) a number of New Falcon’s Units equal to the number of shares of Pubco Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after the SPAC Merger, (y) a number of preferred units of Falcon’s equal to the number of shares of Pubco Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately after the SPAC Merger and (z) a number of warrant units of Falcon’s equal to the number of warrants of Pubco outstanding immediately after the SPAC Merger, in each case of the foregoing clauses (x) through (z) after giving effect to the redemption of any shares of common stock of the Company in connection with the exercise of redemption rights, the Class B Exchange and the Conversion.

Additional information regarding Falcon’s and the Business Combination is available in the proxy statement/prospectus most recently filed by Pubco with the SEC on February 14, 2023.



The Merger Agreement provides for the following changes from the Original Merger Agreement: 





● | Changes to Acquisition Merger Consideration: The number of shares of Pubco Class B Common Stock and New Company Units to be issued in exchange for current Falcon’s Units (excluding Falcon’s Financing Units) in the Acquisition Merger was reduced from 88,653,263 to 48,587,077.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | EBITDA and Revenue Earnouts: In addition to the 40 million Seller Earnout Shares earned based on the Pubco Common Share Price provided for in the Original Merger Agreement, the holders of Falcon’s Units immediately before the Closing (other than the holders of Falcon’s Financing Units in their capacity as holders of Falcon’s Financing Units) will now be entitled to receive a pro rata portion of a total of up to 40 million additional Seller Earnout Shares based on Pubco’s achievement of specified EBITDA and revenue targets in 2023 and 2024. Up to 2% of the 80 million Seller Earnout Shares will be allocated to each of Sponsor and Jefferies LLC if they are earned.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Changes to Sponsor Consideration:
--+----------------------------------


80% of the founder shares held by the Sponsor are now subject to forfeiture pro rata based on the amount of funds available at the Acquisition Merger Closing that are primarily sourced by the Company and the Sponsor (including funds in the Trust Account after redemptions) (the “SPAC Capital Received”), measured against a target amount of $222,336,870; provided the Sponsor will retain a minimum of 1,250,000 founder shares. The Sponsor will continue to forfeit the remaining 20% of its founder shares, but will now have the opportunity to earn them back (as well as any shares forfeited based on SPAC Capital Received) based on achievement of the Pubco Common Share Price, Pubco revenue and Pubco EBITDA earnout targets.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Sponsor further agreed to forfeit 50% of its private placement warrants if SPAC Capital Received is less than $50 million and to amend the Warrant Agreement to provide that its private placement warrants are redeemable (subject to the concurrent redemption of other warrants) at a redemption price of $0.01 per warrant if the Reference Value (as defined below) is at least $18 per share (the “Warrant Agreement Amendment”). “Reference Value” means the last reported sales price of the shares of Class A Common Stock for any twenty (20) trading days within the thirty (30) trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which notice of the redemption is given.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Extension: The Company agreed to take certain actions to extend the date by which it has to complete a Business Combination to October 18, 2023 (the “Extension”). Infinite agreed to fund up to $2,000,000 of expenses related to the Extension pursuant to a promissory note, described in more detail above.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






5








● | Termination: The Termination Date was extended from April 11, 2023 to September 30, 2023. the Company’s termination right if Falcon’s fails to deliver its audited financial statements by a specified date was eliminated. Termination rights in favor of the Company were added in the case where Infinite defaults under the Promissory Note or if Falcon’s enters into certain specified interim financing arrangements (the “Interim Financing Termination”). Mutual termination rights were added in the case where, following a cure period, the Company is not listed on an approved exchange or is in default of the listing requirements of the exchange it is listed on (the “Delisting Termination”) or if the closing condition related to the listing of Pubco shares on an approved exchange is not satisfied following the satisfaction of all other closing conditions (the “Pubco Listing Termination”).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Termination Fee: The Company will be entitled to a termination fee of $12,500,000 (minus 50% of any amounts funded by Infinite under the Promissory Note) at the time of termination if the A&R Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason specified in the Merger Agreement other than: (i) mutual agreement of Falcon’s and the Company; (ii) the Company’s breach of the Merger Agreement in a manner that causes the failure of a condition to Closing under the Merger Agreement (when Falcon’s is not also in breach); (iii) the consummation of either Merger is permanently enjoined or prohibited by the terms of a final, non-appealable governmental order or other law if the final, non-appealable governmental order or other law is generally applicable to all special purpose acquisition companies or primarily caused by any action or inaction of the Company; (iv) the Company’s stockholders fail to approve the Business Combination at the special meeting of stockholders called for such purpose; (v) if the Company’s board of directors changes its recommendation to stockholders or fails to recommend the Merger in the proxy statement; (vi) pursuant to the Delisting Termination; or (vii) failure to close by the Termination Date or two days after the Special Meeting (when the Falcon’s is not in breach). In addition, no termination fee will be payable at any time Falcon’s could terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to the Delisting Termination or because of the Company’s breach of the Merger Agreement in a manner that causes the failure of a condition to Closing under the Merger Agreement. The termination fee will be reduced by 50% and payable at any time within 12 months of termination instead of at the time of termination if the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to the Interim Financing Termination or the Pubco Listing Termination, or is terminated at a time when the Company or Falcon’s could terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to the Pubco Listing Termination.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Alternative Financing: The Company may enter into one or more agreements with any investor to effect certain Pre-Approved Financing Arrangements (as defined in the Merger Agreement) without any consent or approval required from Falcon’s.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Merger Agreement also makes certain technical and other changes to the Original Merger Agreement. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties, and covenants that the parties to the Merger Agreement made to each other as of the date of the Merger Agreement or other specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties, and covenants were made for purposes of the contract among the parties and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement has been attached to provide investors with information regarding its terms and is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company, Falcon’s, Pubco or any other party to the Merger Agreement. In particular, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, which were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties (including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts) and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors and reports and documents filed with the SEC. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements, or any descriptions thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of any party to the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements and other terms of the Merger Agreement may be subject to subsequent waiver or modification. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties and other terms may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s public disclosures.



On January 31, 2023, in connection with the Merger Agreement, our Sponsor, the Company, Falcon’s and Pubco entered into an Amended and Restated Sponsor Support Agreement whereby, among other things, our Sponsor agreed (i) to exchange its shares of Class B Common Stock for shares of Class A Common Stock in accordance with the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation such that, prior to the SPAC Merger Effective Time, there shall cease to be outstanding any shares of Class B Common Stock, (ii) to forfeit a portion of its founder shares and private placement warrants to the extent and as described above and (iii) to support the Warrant Agreement Amendment. The Sponsor further agreed to vote (or cause to be voted), or execute and deliver a written consent (or cause a written consent to be executed and delivered) covering, all of its Common Stock (i) in favor of the Mergers and each other proposal related to the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) against any merger agreement or merger (other than the Merger Agreement and the Mergers), consolidation, combination, sale of substantial assets, reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of or by the Company (iii) against any change in the business, management or the board of directors of the Company (other than in connection with the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement), and (iv) against any proposal, action or agreement that would (w) impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the Merger Agreement or any Merger, (x) result in a breach in any respect of any covenant, representation, warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company or the Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, (y) result in any of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled or (z) change in any manner the dividend policy or capitalization of, including the voting rights of any class of capital stock of, the Company.

In addition, the Company and Infinite entered into a promissory note (the “Promissory Note”) pursuant to which Infinite agreed to advance up to $2,000,000 to the Company, with any advances under the Promissory Note to be used by the Company to pay certain expenses of the Extension. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and repayable, in cash, or, at Pubco’s option, in shares of Pubco Class A Common Stock at a conversion price of $10.00 per share, at the effective time of the Acquisition Merger and will be forgiven without payment if the Merger Agreement is terminated.



See our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 3, 2023 including the Merger Agreement and related amended supporting agreements. In addition, on February 14, 2023, Pubco, filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-269778) (the “Registration Statement”) that includes a proxy statement/prospectus relating to the Business Combination as more fully described in the Registration Statement.



Initial Business Combination



The rules of the NYSE require that we must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of Falcon’s was substantially in excess of 80% of the funds in the trust account and that the 80% test was therefore satisfied.



If we do not consummate the proposed Business Combination with Falcon’s and find another business combination targer, if our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it likely that our board of directors will be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board of directors determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. As any such opinion, if obtained, would only state that the fair market value meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of the target or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our stockholders. However, if required by Schedule 14A of the Exchange Act, any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we will file with the SEC in connection with our initial business combination will include such opinion. If our securities are not listed on NYSE, we would not be required to satisfy the 80% requirement. However, we intend to satisfy the 80% requirement even if our securities are not listed on NYSE at the time of our initial business combination.




7







Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of a majority of our board of directors, which must include a majority of our independent directors, to approve our initial business combination. The proposed Business Combination with Falcon’s has received the affirmative vote of a majority of our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors.



We have previously filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register certain of our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.



Status as a Public Company



We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses and market and other uncertainties in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.



Furthermore, once a proposed initial business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial business combination, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.



Corporate Information



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our sfecurities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.





8







We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.



Financial Position



As of March 10, 2023, we had funds available for a business combination in the amount of approximately $64.6 million (assuming no further redemptions), after payment of $7,775,000 of deferred underwriting fees in connection with the proposed business combination with Falcon’s (which deferred underwriting fees would be equal to $7,781,790 in connection with any other business combination). We offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination



General



We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.



If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.



We currently have a pending business combination with Falcon’s. If our business combination with Falcon’s is not completed, there will be no basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of another target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business.





9







We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise. An affiliate of our sponsor may receive payment for services provided in connection with any such additional financing, the terms of which have not been determined nor have any written agreements been executed with respect thereto.



Sources of Target Businesses



We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and private investment funds. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus relating to the initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of a finder’s fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation by the company prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). In addition, we pay our sponsor $15,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support services provided to members of our management team. Any such payments prior to our initial business combination will be made from funds held outside the trust account. Other than the foregoing, there will be no finder’s fees, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation paid by us to our sponsor, officers or directors, or any affiliate of our sponsor or officers prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, or from completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm, that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.



Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.





10







The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. We will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.



Lack of Business Diversification



For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team



Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.



We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.



Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination



If the proposed Business Combination with Falcon’s is not consummated, we may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.





11







Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.




TYPE OF TRANSACTION | WHETHER STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL IS REQUIRED 
--------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 




Under NYSE’s listing rules, stockholder approval would typically be required for our initial business combination if, for example:




● | we issue (other than in a public offering for cash) shares of common stock that will either (a) be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of common stock then outstanding or (b) have voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power then outstanding;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial security holders (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired and if the number of shares of common stock to be issued, or if the number of shares of common stock into which the securities may be convertible or exercisable, exceeds either (a) 1% of the number of shares of common stock or 1% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any of our directors and officers or (b) 5% of the number of shares of common stock or 5% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any substantial security holders; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities



If, as we expect to do for our proposed Business Combination with Falcon’s, we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and NYSE rules. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material non-public information), our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.



In the event that our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.



The purpose of any such transactions could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination, (ii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met or (iii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such transactions may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.





12







Our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders (in the case of Class A common stock) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the stockholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which stockholders to purchase shares from based on a negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other U.S. federal securities laws. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements.



Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of permitted withdrawals), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Limitations on Redemptions



In the event that the proposed Business Combination with Falcon’s is not consummated, our proposed initial business combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares in connection with such initial business combination, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements, in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such minimum cash requirement.





13







Manner of Conducting Redemptions



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. Except for as required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with NYSE’s shareholder approval rules.



The requirement that we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares by one of the two methods listed above will be contained in provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will apply whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on the NYSE. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon.



If we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with a stockholder meeting, we will:




● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------




If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of our outstanding capital stock representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed to vote any founder shares they hold and any public shares purchased after the Initial Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, it is possible our initial business combination could be approved without any holders of public shares voting in favor of the initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction.



Because of the structure of the proposed Business Combination with Falcon's, we will be able to complete such Business Combination with Falcon's only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of our outstanding capital stock representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed to vote any founder shares they hold and any public shares purchased after the Initial Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders’ founder shares, we would need only 788,544, or 11.1%, of the 7,135,509 outstanding public shares to be voted in favor of the Business Combination with Falcon's in order to have such Business Combination with Falcon's approved.



If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will:




● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination.





14







Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.



We intend to require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the date on which the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination is to be held. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. We believe that this will allow our transfer agent to efficiently process any redemptions without the need for further communication or action from the redeeming public stockholders, which could delay redemptions and result in additional administrative cost. If the proposed initial business combination is not approved and we continue to search for a target business, we will promptly return any certificates or shares delivered by public stockholders who elected to redeem their shares.



Our Merger Agreement with Falcon’s does not have a minimum cash requirement. In the event that the proposed Business Combination with Falcon’s is not consummated, our proposed initial business combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares in connection with such initial business combination, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and instead may search for an alternate business combination. However, we may raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into, in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such minimum cash requirement.



Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Stockholder Approval



If, as we expect to do for our proposed Business Combination with Falcon’s, we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.



However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.





15







Delivering Stock Certificates in Connection with the Exercise of Redemption Rights



As described above, we intend to require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have up to two business days prior to the vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, or from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, as applicable, to submit or tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures disclosed in the proxy or tender offer materials, as applicable, its shares may not be redeemed. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the broker submitting or tendering shares a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to submit or tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.



Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable (unless we elect to allow additional withdrawal rights). Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.



If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.



If our initial proposed initial business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a different initial business combination with a different target until June 18, 2023. The Company may, without a stockholder vote, by resolution of the Company’s board, elect to further extend this date in one-month increments, up to four additional times.



Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have until June 18, 2023 to complete our initial business combination (which date the Company may, without a stockholder vote, by resolution of the Company’s board, elect to further extend in one-month increments, up to four additional times). If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by June 18, 2023 or during any further extension period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by June 18, 2023 or during any further extension period.

Our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination by June 18, 2023 or any extended period of time that we may have to consummate an initial business combination as a result of the exercise of any of the four one-month extension options or another amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, if our initial stockholders, sponsor or management team acquire public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by June 18, 2023 or during any further extension period.



Our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by June 18, 2023 (or during any further extension period) or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of permitted withdrawals), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares.



We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $850,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.



If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account (not taking into account any additional deposits) and any tax payments or expenses for the dissolution of the trust, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.

Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to us and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be in the best interests of the company under the circumstances. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The underwriters of the Initial Public Offering and our independent registered public accounting firm will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.



In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per share.



We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately $850,000 from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.

Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by June 18, 2023 (or during any further extension period pursuant to our charter)may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.



Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of the funds in our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by June 18, 2023 (or during any further extension period pursuant to our charter), is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by June 18, 2023 or during any further extension period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible after June 18, 2023 (or any further extension period) and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.



Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.



If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by June 18, 2023 or during any further extension period, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by June 18, 2023 (as may be extended to October 18, 2023 pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation) or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of our initial business combination, and then only in connection with those public shares that such stockholder has properly elected to redeem. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees



We currently have two officers: Sandy Beall and Garrett Schreiber. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
