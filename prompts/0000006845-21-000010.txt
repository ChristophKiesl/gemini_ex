ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Apogee, the Company or we) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Minnesota in 1949. We are a leader in the design and development of architectural building products and services.
Our Company has four reporting segments, with three of the segments serving the commercial construction market: 
•The Architectural Framing Systems segment designs, engineers, fabricates and finishes aluminum window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems comprising the exterior of buildings. In fiscal 2021, this segment accounted for approximately 46 percent of our net sales. 
•The Architectural Glass segment coats and fabricates, high-performance glass used in custom window and wall systems on commercial buildings. In fiscal 2021, this segment accounted for approximately 24 percent of our net sales.
•The Architectural Services segment integrates technical services, project management, and field installation services to design, engineer, fabricate, and install building glass and curtainwall systems. In fiscal 2021, this segment accounted for approximately 24 percent of our net sales. 
•The Large-Scale Optical Technologies (LSO) segment manufactures value-added coated glass and acrylic products for custom framing, museum, and technical glass markets. In fiscal 2021, this segment accounted for approximately 6 percent of our net sales. 
Strategy
Our strategy is to diversify revenue streams within the commercial construction industry, providing revenue growth and profit generation over an economic cycle, and utilize our capabilities to enter adjacent segments. We work to diversify end markets served through growth from new geographies, new products and new market segments, while working to improve margins through productivity, integration, project selection and rigorous cost management. 
In an effort to drive growth and reduce our exposure to the cyclical nature of the large-building segment of the commercial construction industry, we are working to expand our capabilities to serve small- and mid-sized projects across our architectural segments and working to expand our North American geographic reach.
Specifically over the past fiscal year, in the Architectural Framing Systems segment, our focus was to drive margin improvement through increased productivity, cost management, integration, supply chain optimization, and new product development. In the Architectural Glass segment, we began operation of our new fabrication facility designed to serve small-sized and quick-turn projects in Dallas, Texas. In the Architectural Services segment, our emphasis is to generate consistent margins through focused project selection and execution, while continuing to deliver long-term organic growth through targeted geographic expansion. 
Within the LSO segment, we are working to grow in new channels, markets and geographies that desire the value-added properties that our glass and acrylics products provide.
Across all our segments, we regularly evaluate business development opportunities in adjacent sectors that will complement our existing portfolio. Finally, we are constantly working to improve the efficiency and productivity of our operations by implementing continuous improvement, lean manufacturing principles and automation where we can achieve solid return on investment. 
Products and Services
Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass and Architectural Services segments
These three segments serve the commercial construction industry and participate in various phases of the value stream to design, engineer, fabricate and install custom glass and aluminum window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems comprising the exterior of buildings, primarily in the commercial, institutional and multi-family residential construction sectors. 
Within our Architectural Framing Systems segment, we design, engineer and fabricate aluminum window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems. We also extrude aluminum and provide finishing services for metal components used in a variety of building materials applications, as well as plastic components for other markets.
In our Architectural Glass segment, we fabricate coated glass and apply high-performance coatings to uncoated glass to create a variety of aesthetic characteristics, unique designs and energy-efficient qualities. We also laminate and temper layers of glass and vinyl for protection and strength against hazards such as severe weather and blasts. Much of our high-performance glass is 
made-to-order and is typically fabricated into insulating and/or laminated glass units for window, curtainwall, storefront or entrance systems.
Our Architectural Services segment delivers value by integrating technical capabilities, project management skills and field installation services, to provide design, engineering, fabrication and installation services for the exteriors of commercial buildings. Our ability to efficiently design high-quality window and curtainwall systems and effectively manage the installation of building façades enables our customers to meet schedule and cost requirements of their projects.
Our product and service offerings across these architectural segments allow architects to create distinctive looks for buildings such as office towers, hotels, education and athletic facilities, health care facilities, government buildings, retail centers, mixed use and multi-family residential buildings, while also meeting functional requirements such as energy efficiency, hurricane, blast and other impact resistance and/or sound control.
Many of our architectural products and services help architects, developers, and building owners achieve their energy-efficiency and sustainability goals, by improving energy performance, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions, providing daylight and natural ventilation, and increasing comfort and safety for occupants. These products include high-performance thermal framing systems, energy efficient glass coatings, and sun control products such as sunshades and light shelves. Many of our framing systems products can be specified with recycled aluminum content and utilize environmentally friendly anodize and paint finishes. In addition, we offer a wide range of renovation solutions to help modernize aging buildings, providing significantly improved energy performance, while preserving historically accurate aesthetics.
LSO segment
The LSO segment provides coated glass and acrylic primarily for use in custom picture framing, museum framing, wall decor and technical glass for other display applications. Products vary based on size and coatings to provide conservation-grade UV protection, anti-reflective and anti-static properties and/or security features. 
Product Demand and Distribution Channels
Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass and Architectural Services segments
Demand for the products and services offered by our architectural segments is affected by changes in the North American commercial construction industry, as well as by changes in general economic conditions. Additionally, the Architectural Glass segment has Brazilian operations which are impacted by Brazil's commercial construction industry and general economic conditions. 
We look at several external indicators to analyze potential demand for our products and services, such as U.S. and Canadian job growth, office vacancy rates, credit and interest rates available for commercial construction projects, architectural billing statistics and material costs. We also rely on internal indicators to analyze demand, including our sales pipeline, which is made up of contracts in review, projects awarded or committed, and bidding activity. Our sales pipeline, together with ongoing feedback, analysis and data from our customers, architects and building owners, provide visibility into near- and medium-term future demand. Additionally, we evaluate data on U.S. and Canadian non-residential construction market activity, industry analysis and longer-term trends provided by external data sources. 
Our architectural products and services are used in subsets of the construction industry differentiated by the following types of factors: 
•Building type - Our products and services are primarily used in commercial buildings (office buildings, hotels and retail centers), institutional buildings (education facilities, health care facilities and government buildings), and multi-family residential buildings (a subset of residential construction).
•Level of customization - Many of our projects involve a high degree of customization, as the product or service is designed to meet customer-specified requirements for aesthetics, performance and size, and local building codes. 
•Customers and distribution channels - Our customers are mainly glazing subcontractors and general contractors, with project design being influenced by architects and building owners. Our high-performance architectural glass is primarily sold using both a direct sales force and independent sales representatives. Our installation services are sold by a direct sales force in certain metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems are sold using a combination of direct sales forces, independent sales representatives and distributors.
•Geographic location - We primarily supply architectural glass products and aluminum framing systems, including window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems, to customers in North America. We are one of only a few 
architectural glass installation service companies in the U.S. to have a national presence and we have the ability to provide remote installation project management throughout the U.S. Our Architectural Glass segment also supplies architectural glass products to customers in Brazil and certain other international locations.
LSO segment
In our LSO segment, we have a leading brand of value-added coated glass and acrylic used in the custom picture-framing market and museum market. Under the Tru Vue brand, products are sold primarily in North America through national and regional retail chains using a direct sales force, as well as through local retailers using an independent distribution network. We also supply our glass, acrylic and other products to museums, galleries and other organizations in Europe and other international locations through independent distributors.
Competitive Conditions
Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass and Architectural Services segments
The North American commercial construction market is highly fragmented. Competitive factors include price, product quality, product attributes and performance, reliable service, on-time delivery, lead-time, warranty and the ability to provide project management, technical engineering and design services. To protect and enhance our competitive position, we maintain strong relationships with building owners and architects, who influence the selection of products and services on a project, and with general contractors, who initiate projects and develop specifications. 
There is a great deal of competition in the North American commercial window and storefront manufacturing industry, and our Architectural Framing Systems segment competes against several national, regional and local aluminum window and storefront manufacturers, as well as regional paint and anodizing finishing companies. Our businesses compete by providing high-quality products, innovation, reliable on-time delivery and short lead times. 
In our Architectural Glass segment, we experience competition from regional glass fabricators who can provide certain products with attributes similar to our products. Within the market sector for large, complex projects, we encounter competition from international companies and large regional fabricators, some of which have benefited from the relative strength of the U.S. dollar and lower fabrication costs in recent years. We differentiate ourselves by providing high-quality, innovative and customizable products, short lead times, and strong customer service. 
Our Architectural Services segment competes against national and regional glass installation companies. We distinguish ourselves from these competitors through our strong project management and our track record of regularly meeting each project's unique execution requirements. 
LSO segment
Product attributes, price, quality, marketing and service are the primary competitive factors in the LSO segment. Our competitive strengths include our excellent relationships with customers, innovative marketing programs and the performance of our value-added products. We compete with certain European and U.S. valued-added glass and acrylic companies.
Warranties
We offer product and service warranties that we believe are competitive for the markets in which our products and services are sold. The nature and extent of these warranties depend upon the product or service, the market and, in some cases, the customer being served. Our standard warranties are generally from two to 10 years for our architectural glass, curtainwall and window system products, while we generally offer warranties of two years or less on our other products and services. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

Despite being a point of differentiation from our competitors, no single patent is considered to be material.
Seasonality
Activity in the construction industry is impacted by the seasonal impact of weather and weather events in our operating locations, with activity in some markets reduced in winter due to inclement weather. 
Working Capital Requirements
Trade and contract-related receivables and other contract assets are the largest components of our working capital. Inventory requirements, mainly related to raw materials, are most significant in our Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Glass segments. 
Backlog
Backlog represents the dollar amount of signed contracts or firm orders, generally as a result of a competitive bidding process, which may be expected to be recognized as revenue in the future. Backlog is not a term defined under U.S. GAAP and is not a measure of contract profitability. In addition to backlog, we have a substantial amount of projects with short lead times that book-and-bill within the same reporting period and are not included in backlog. We have good visibility beyond backlog, as projects awarded, verbal commitments and bidding activities are not included in backlog.
Architectural Framing Systems segment backlog as of year-end was $411.3 million, compared to $429.6 million at the end of the prior year, reflecting a decline in order volume. We expect approximately 60 percent of the backlog in this segment to be fulfilled in fiscal 2022, with the remainder expected to be filled in fiscal 2023 and beyond; however, the timing of backlog may be impacted by project delays.
Architectural Glass segment backlog as of year-end was $43.5 million, net of intersegment eliminations, compared to $31.0 million at the end of the prior year, due to extended lead times and order activity. We expect this backlog to be fulfilled in fiscal 2022. 
Backlog in the Architectural Services segment as of year-end was $570.9 million, compared to $659.7 million at the end of the prior year, due to timing of firm orders, signed contracts and the broader industry slow-down that occurred in fiscal 2021. We expect approximately 50 percent of the backlog in this segment to be filled during fiscal 2022, with the remainder expected to be filled in fiscal 2023 and beyond; however, the timing of backlog may be impacted by project delays. 
Backlog is not a significant metric for the LSO segment, as orders are typically booked and billed within a short time-frame.
Compliance with Government Regulations
We are subject to extensive regulation under environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things, our use and storage of hazardous materials in our manufacturing operations and associated air emissions and discharges to surface and underground waters. We have several continuing programs designed to ensure compliance with foreign, federal, state and local environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. We contract with outside vendors to collect and dispose of waste at our production facilities in compliance with applicable environmental laws. In addition, we have procedures in place that enable us to properly manage the regulated materials used in and wastes created by our manufacturing processes. We believe we are currently in material compliance with all such laws and regulations. While we will continue to incur costs for compliance with government regulations for our ongoing operations, we do not expect these to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. At one manufacturing facility in our Architectural Framing Systems segment, we are continuing to work to remediate historical environmental impacts. These remediation activities are being conducted without significant disruption to our operations. 
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause uncertainty in global markets. During fiscal 2021, we experienced delays in commercial construction projects and orders because of COVID-19 and other disruptions to our business, including various physical distancing and health-related precautions, and we were required to close operations at two facilities in our LSO segment for a portion of the year due to governmental orders. Earlier in the pandemic, we were impacted by quarantine-related absenteeism among our production workforce, resulting in labor constraints at some of our facilities. While our efforts to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic have evolved positively, the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our business will depend in part on the effectiveness of ongoing public health initiatives, which have been buoyed by vaccine production and distribution.
In response to this pandemic, we took several cost actions, including a merit and hiring freeze, temporary pay reductions, temporary suspension of the Company's 401(k) matching program, and made short term reductions in capital expenses, while emphasizing spending controls across the company. These temporary cost actions were mostly lifted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
Human Capital Resources
The Company had approximately 6,100 employees on February 27, 2021, down from 7,200 employees on February 29, 2020. As of February 27, 2021, approximately 560 of these employees were represented by U.S. labor unions. 
Competition for qualified employees in the markets and industries in which we operate is strong, and the success of our Company depends on our ability to attract, select, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Investing in our employees and their well-being, offering competitive compensation and benefits, promoting diversity and inclusion, and adopting positive human capital management practices are critical components of our corporate strategy.
Health, Wellness and Safety
The safety of our employees is integral to our Company. Providing a safe and secure work environment is one of our highest priorities and we devote significant time and resources to workplace safety. Our safety program is directed by our Risk Roundtable, comprised of safety leaders from across our Company. This group meets quarterly to review safety performance, share best practices, set goals and objectives for the organization, and plan safety culture assessments. In support of our safety efforts, we identify, assess and investigate incidents and injury data, and each year set goals to improve key safety performance indicators. We train, promote, consult and communicate with our workforce during this process. 
We offer a comprehensive health and wellness program for our employees. In addition to standard health programs including medical insurance and preventive care, we have a variety of resources available to employees relating to physical and mental wellness. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions consistent with recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect our workforce. We will continue to emphasize the health and safety of our employees going forward.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Our diversity, equity and inclusion program promotes a workplace where each employee’s abilities are recognized, respected, and utilized to further the Company’s goals. Our aim is to create an environment where people feel included as a part of a team 
because of their diversity of outlooks, perspectives, and characteristics, which ultimately adds value for our company. We strive to create a culture of inclusion, reduce bias in our talent practices, and invest in and engage with our communities. We conduct diversity and code of conduct trainings with employees and managers to promote an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals feel respected and part of a team regardless of their race, national origin, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity. 
Talent Management and Development
Our talent management program is focused on developing employees and leaders to meet the Company’s evolving needs. Managers actively engage with their employees to provide coaching and feedback and identify training and development opportunities to improve performance in the employee’s current role and to position the employee for future growth. Training and development opportunities include new-hire training, job specific training, stretch assignments, and safety training. The company also offers leadership development opportunities, such as our Apogee Leadership Program, along with technical training for engineers, designers and sales staff. In addition, the company offers an education assistance program in which certain eligible employees receive tuition reimbursement to help defray the costs associated with their continuing education. Our executive leadership and Human Resources teams regularly conduct talent reviews and succession planning to assist with meeting critical talent and leadership needs.
