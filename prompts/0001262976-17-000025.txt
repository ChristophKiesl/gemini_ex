Item 1. Business
Overview 
We are a technology driven company that aggregates, largely via the internet, large volumes of small, individually customized orders for a broad spectrum of print, signage, apparel and similar products. We operate in a largely decentralized manner. Our businesses, discussed in more detail below, fulfill orders with manufacturing capabilities that include Cimpress owned and operated manufacturing facilities and a network of third-party fulfillers to create customized products on-demand. Those businesses bring their products to market through a portfolio of customer-focused brands serving the needs of micro, small and medium sized businesses, resellers and consumers. These brands include Vistaprint, our global brand for micro business marketing products and services, as well as brands that we have acquired that serve the needs of various market segments, including resellers, micro, small and medium sized businesses with differentiated service needs, and consumers purchasing products for themselves and their families. 
Our Priorities
We have two uppermost objectives: 

1. | Strategic: To be the world leader in mass customization.


2. | Financial: To maximize intrinsic value per share, defined as (a) the unlevered free cash flow per share that, in our best judgment, will occur between now and the long-term future, appropriately discounted to reflect our cost of capital, minus (b) net debt per share.

World Leader in Mass Customization
Cimpress’ strategic objective is to defend and extend its position as the world leader in mass customization. Mass customization is a business model that allows companies to deliver major improvements to customer value across a wide variety of customized printed product categories. Companies that master mass customization are able to produce, with the reliability, quality and affordability of mass production, small individual orders where each one embodies the personal relevance inherent to customized products. 

The chart illustrates this concept. The horizontal axis represents the volume of production of a given product; the vertical axis represents the cost of producing one unit of that product. Traditionally, the only way to manufacture at a low unit cost was to produce a large volume of that product: mass-produced products fall in the lower right hand corner of the chart. Custom-made products (i.e., those produced in small volumes for a very specific purpose) historically incurred very high unit costs: they fall in the upper left hand side of the chart. Mass customization breaks this trade off, enabling low volume, low cost production of individually unique products. Very importantly, relative to traditional alternatives mass customization creates value in many ways, not just lower cost. Other advantages can include faster production, greater personal relevance, elimination of obsolete stock, better design, flexible shipping options, more product choice, and higher quality. 

Mass customization delivers a breakthrough in customer value particularly in markets in which the worth of a physical product is inherently tied to a specific, unique use or application. For instance, there is limited value to a marketing brochure that is the same brochure as is used by many other companies: the business owner needs to describe what is unique about his or her endeavor. Likewise, a photo mug is more personally relevant if it shows pictures of someone’s own friends and family. Before mass customization, producing a high quality custom product 
1

required high per-order setup costs, so it simply was not economical to produce a customized product in low quantities. 
Cimpress’ focus on mass customization lies at the intersection of three overlapping areas: 

• | Empowering People to Make an Impression (what we are passionate about) - Cimpress empowers people to make an impression through individually meaningful physical products. In other words, we make it easy and affordable for our customers to convey, in tangible and enduring media, the thoughts, design aesthetics, messages and/or sentiments that are important to them, their customers, their organization or their loved ones.


• | Computer Integrated Manufacturing (where we can be the best in the world) - Low-volume custom products traditionally have a very high per-unit cost because of significant fixed costs related to conveying and using information that is required to process each order. Throughout our history, a differentiating capability of Cimpress has been our ability to develop systems to integrate every step of the value chain, from design creation to delivery. This greatly reduces the marginal cost of processing information related to each individual, customized order. We use computer integrated manufacturing, which harnesses the power of software and IT networks to automate the flow of information, allowing individual processes to exchange information with each other, to schedule activities, to initiate actions, and to route and control a broad range of activities related to the specification and production of physical goods.


• | Large Scale in Small Quantities (what drives our economic engine) - By large scale we mean a large volume of orders; by small quantities we mean small individual orders. Large scale is an important driver of our competitive advantage because increasingly larger volumes of orders allow us to sort and then produce those orders in increasingly focused processes. This allows us to generate economic value by capturing a portion of the per-unit cost difference that exists between relatively high-volume, specialized processes and low volume (job shop) processes. When we have increased the volume of orders that we process and produce we have seen material improvements in quality, product selection, speed and cost. Cimpress' businesses process tens of millions of uniquely customized items per year.

Our Corporate Strategy
We believe the mass customization opportunity is very large, with extremely diverse and continuously changing customer segments, product categories, go-to-market methods, business maturity levels, technologies and emerging opportunities. We face competition from hundreds of smaller, customer-focused companies as well as very large firms. Focus, nimbleness and speed are critical for Cimpress if we are to serve customers well. Given this context, we have chosen a deeply decentralized organizational strategy through which we hope to “stay small as we get big”.
Our strategy is to invest in and build customer-focused, entrepreneurial, mass customization businesses for the long term, which we manage in a decentralized, autonomous manner. We drive competitive advantage across Cimpress by investing in a select few shared capabilities that have the greatest potential to create company-wide value. We limit all other central activities to only those which we believe absolutely must be performed centrally.
Organizational Structure
On January 23, 2017, the Supervisory Board of Cimpress N.V. approved a plan to restructure the company and implement organizational changes that decentralized the company’s operations in order to improve accountability for customer satisfaction and capital returns, simplify decision-making, improve the speed of execution, further develop our cadre of general managers, and release entrepreneurial energy. In order to enact the plan, we transferred approximately 3,000 team members that were part of central teams into our businesses. We also reduced the scope of certain other roles and functions that were previously performed centrally, which led to the termination of approximately 135 team members, and reduction of planned hiring in targeted areas. We also eliminated the positions of four Cimpress executive officers who, as a result, left the company.
Several groups that previously were part of our corporate and global functions, including significant portions of our technology, manufacturing and supply chain, finance, legal and other related groups, have been decentralized into our operating segments. The majority of the groups that transferred into our operating segments joined our Vistaprint business and to a much smaller extent our Upload and Print businesses.

Corporate and global functions now consist primarily of global procurement, a central technology team whose primary focus is building the mass customization platform, and essential corporate services, such as the corporate finance, communications, strategy and legal functions.
Market and Industry Background
Mass Customization Opportunity

Product: | Geography: | Customer: 
- Small format | - North America | - Businesses (micro, small, 
- Large format | - Europe | medium, large) 
- Promotional products and gifts | - Australia/New Zealand | - Graphic designers, resellers,
- Decorated apparel | - South America | and print providers

 Large traditional markets undergoing disruptive innovation
We believe that our mass customization business model can deliver great customer value across a diverse set of product applications, including marketing materials such as business cards, brochures, catalogs and flyers; signage and displays; promotional products; writing instruments; decorated apparel and bags; fabrics and textiles; keepsakes and gifts, packaging, photo products, invitations and announcements. Many different customers appreciate access to affordable, high quality, customized products in these categories, including businesses of all sizes, teams, associations and groups, consumers, and resellers and designers who serve customers in these groups.
The product categories and customers listed above constitute a large market opportunity that is highly fragmented. We believe that the vast majority of the markets to which mass customization could apply is still served by traditional business models that force customers either to produce in large quantities per order or to pay a high price per unit. 
We believe that these large and fragmented markets are moving away from small traditional suppliers that employ job shop business models to fulfill a relatively small number of customer orders and toward companies such as Cimpress that aggregate a relatively large number of orders and fulfill them via focused supply chain and production capabilities at relatively high volumes, thereby achieving the benefits of mass customization. We believe we are early in the process of what will be a multi-decade shift from job-shop business models to mass customization.

Cimpress' current revenue represents a very small fraction of this market opportunity. Even though we believe Cimpress is the largest single player in this market, there are many other companies who are pursuing mass customization and/or business models that incorporate many aspects of mass customization. These non-traditional suppliers include both large firms and hundreds of focused smaller firms. We believe that Cimpress and competitors who have built their business around a mass customization model are “disruptive innovators” to these large markets because we enable small volume production of personalized high quality products at an affordable price. Disruptive innovation, a term coined by Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen, describes a process by which a product or service takes root initially in simple applications at the bottom of a market (such as free business cards for the most price sensitive of micro-businesses) and then moves up market, eventually displacing established competitors (such as those in the markets mentioned above).
We believe this opportunity to deliver substantially better customer value and to therefore disrupt very large traditional industries can translate into tremendous future opportunity for Cimpress if we execute well and constantly improve our business model over a long period of time. Until recently, we focused primarily on a narrow set of customers within the list above (micro businesses and consumers) with a very limited product offering. With acquisitions and via internal investments over the last several years, we have extended our ability to serve our traditional customers and have also gained a capability to serve larger businesses as well as resellers who, in turn, serve many different types of customers.
As we continue to evolve as a business, our understanding of these markets and their relative attractiveness is also evolving. Our expansion into the “upload and print” space, promotional products, apparel, gifts and packaging, as well as new geographic markets has significantly increased the size of our addressable market opportunity. We base our market size and attractiveness estimates upon considerable research and analysis; however we consider our estimates to be only approximate. Despite the imprecise nature of our estimates, we believe that our understanding is directionally correct and that we operate in an enormous aggregate market with significant opportunity for Cimpress to grow should we be successful in delivering a differentiated and attractive value proposition to customers. 
Today, we believe that the revenue opportunity for low-to-medium order quantities (i.e. still within our focus of small-sized individual orders) in the four product categories below is over $100 billion annually in North America and Europe. The addition of other geographies and the consumer products space adds at least 50% to this number:

• | Small format marketing materials such as business cards, flyers, leaflets, inserts, brochures and magazines. Businesses of all sizes are the main end users of short-and-medium run lengths (per order quantities below 2,500 units for business cards and below 20,000 units for other materials).


• | Large format products such as banners, signs, tradeshow displays, and point-of-sale displays. Businesses of all sizes are the main end users of short-and-medium run lengths (less than 1,000 units).


• | Promotional products, apparel and gifts including decorated apparel, bags and textiles, and hard goods such as pens, USB sticks, and drinkware. The end users of short-and-medium runs of these products range from businesses to teams, associations and groups, as well as consumers.


• | Packaging products, such as corrugated board packaging, folded cartons, bags and labels. Businesses are the primary end users for short-and-medium runs (below 10,000 units).

Our Opportunity: Over $100 billion total addressable market in North America and Europe
Our Business
Today’s Cimpress includes 13 previously independent businesses that we have acquired plus Vistaprint and several small startup businesses, which we grew organically. Prior to its acquisition, each of our acquired companies pursued business models which embodied the principles of mass customization. In other words, each provided a standardized set of products that could be configured and customized by customers, could be ordered in relatively low volumes, and could produce via relatively standardized, homogeneous production processes either internally and/or through third parties.
The majority of our businesses are driven by sophisticated, standardized processes and software. These technologies are designed to readily scale as the number of orders received per day increases. In particular, the more individual jobs we receive in a given time period, the more efficiently we can sort and route jobs with homogeneous production processes to given nodes of our internal production systems or of our third party supply chain. This sortation and subsequent process automation improves production efficiency. We believe that our strategy of systematizing our service and production systems enables us to deliver value to customers much more effectively than traditional competitors.
We operate production facilities in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, France, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. Importantly, we also work with a network of several hundred external fulfillers located across the globe. We believe that the improvements we have made and the future improvements we intend to make in software technologies that support the design, sortation, scheduling, production and delivery processes provide us with significant competitive advantage. In many cases we can produce and ship an order the same day we receive it. Our supply chain systems and processes seek to drive reduced inventory and working capital requirements as well as faster delivery to customers. In certain of our company-owned manufacturing facilities, software schedules the near-simultaneous production of different customized products that have been ordered by the same customer, allowing us to produce and deliver multi-part orders quickly and efficiently.
We believe that the standard business cards sold by our Vistaprint business provide a concrete example of the potential of our mass customization business model to deliver significant customer value and to develop strong profit franchises in large markets that were previously low growth and commoditized. The current Vistaprint operations for a typical order of 250 business cards in Europe and North America require less than 14 seconds of human labor for all of pre-press, printing, cutting and packaging, versus an hour or more for traditional printers. Combined with advantages of scale in purchasing of materials, our self-service ordering, pre-press automation, auto-scheduling and automated manufacturing processes enable us to produce standard business cards at a 
5

fraction of the cost of typical traditional printers with very consistent quality and delivery reliability. Achieving this type of efficiency took us more than a decade and required massive volume, significant engineering investments and significant capital. Standard Vistaprint business cards (which account for approximately 28% of the Vistaprint business' total bookings for fiscal 2017) represent a mature, highly refined, and highly profitable example of the power of mass customization. Even though we do not expect many other products to reach this extreme level of automation, we do currently produce multiple other product categories (such as flyers, brochures, signage, mugs, calendars, pens, t-shirts, hats, embroidered soft goods, rubber stamps, photobooks, labels and holiday cards) via analogous methods whose volume and processes are well along the spectrum of mass customization relative to traditional suppliers and thus provide great customer value and a strong, profitable and growing revenue stream.
We believe that the potential for scale-based advantages are not limited to large, automated production lines. Other advantages include the ability to systematically and automatically sort through the voluminous "long tail" of diverse and uncommon orders in order to group them into more homogeneous categories, and to route them to production nodes that are specialized for that category of operations and/or which are geographically proximate to the customer. In such cases, even though the daily production volume of a given production node is small in comparison to our highest volume production lines, the homogeneity and volume we are able to achieve is nonetheless significant relative to traditional suppliers of the long tail product in question; thus our relative efficiency gains remain substantial. For this type of long tail production, we rely heavily on third-party fulfillment partnerships, which allow us to offer a very diverse set of products. We acquired most of our capabilities in this area via our investments in Exaprint, Printdeal, Pixartprinting and WIRmachenDRUCK. For instance, the product assortment of each of these four businesses is measured in the tens of thousands, versus just a few hundred at Vistaprint traditionally. This deep and broad product offering is important to many customers. 
Our Businesses
We have adopted a multi-business approach, which we believe will help us effectively develop value propositions that resonate strongly with very different parts of our large and fragmented addressable market for mass customization. As such, we have structured our organization to provide significant autonomy and decentralization for the individual businesses. We believe that this autonomy allows for greater customer responsiveness, increased focus, and more innovation than if we were to manage our customer value proposition centrally. 
We have many localized websites serving countries in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and South America. Our websites offer a broad assortment of tools and features allowing customers to create a product design or upload their own complete design, and place an order on a completely self-service basis or with varying levels of assistance. 
As of June 30, 2017, our businesses were organized into the following four reportable segments:

1. | Vistaprint:


Includes the operations of our Vistaprint-branded websites focused on the North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand markets, and our Webs-branded business, which is managed with the Vistaprint-branded digital business in these same geographies.

Our Vistaprint business helps more than 17 million micro businesses (companies with fewer than 10 employees) create beautiful, professional quality marketing products at affordable prices and at low volumes. To help our customers market in the digital world, the teams at our Pagemodo and Webs brands develop intuitive DIY solutions that are brought to market via their own brands as well as via the Vistaprint brand.

2. | Upload and Print:

Includes the operations of our druck.at, Easyflyer, Exagroup, Pixartprinting, Printdeal, Tradeprint, and WIRmachenDRUCK businesses.

3. | National Pen:


Includes the global operations of our National Pen business and a few smaller brands that are focused on custom writing instruments and promotional products, apparel and gifts for small- and medium-sized businesses.

On December 30, 2016, we acquired 100% of the equity interests of National Pen Co. LLC, the leading provider of a wide array of customized writing instruments for small- and medium-sized businesses in more than 20 countries. The company also sells other promotional products, including travel mugs, water bottles, tech gadgets and trade show items.
National Pen's scale and vertical integration in writing instruments complements our organic investments in technology and supply chain capabilities for promotional products, apparel and gift offerings. It serves about a million small business customers through a successful direct mail marketing and telesales approach, as well as a small growing e-commerce business.

4. | All Other Businesses:

Includes the operations of our Albumprinter, Most of World, and Corporate Solutions businesses. These businesses have been combined into one reportable segment based on materiality.

Our products
Customers visiting our websites can select the type of product they wish to design from our broad range of available products and services for the business, reseller and home and family markets. The combined product assortment across our businesses is extensive, including offerings in the following product categories: business cards, marketing materials such as flyers and postcards, digital and marketing services, writing instruments, signage, decorated apparel, promotional products and gifts, packaging, textiles and magazines and catalogs.
Central procurement
We are focused on achieving the lowest total cost in our strategic sourcing efforts by concentrating on quality, logistics, technology and cost, while also striving to use responsible sourcing practices within our supply chain. Our efforts include the procurement of high quality materials and equipment that meet our strict specifications at a low total cost across a growing number of manufacturing locations, with an increasing focus on supplier compliance with our sustainable paper procurement policy as well as our Supplier Code of Conduct. Additionally, we work to develop and implement logistics, warehousing, and outbound shipping strategies to provide a balance of low-cost material availability while limiting our inventory exposure. We believe investing in a strategic supply chain management capability that is tightly integrated with our other manufacturing teams helps us benefit from our large scale, improve efficiency and reduce costs, and increase the sustainability of our business. 
Our Proprietary Technology, including our Mass Customization Platform
We rely on our advanced proprietary technology to market to, attract and retain our customers, to enable customers to create graphic designs and place orders on our websites, and to aggregate and produce multiple orders from all over the world. Technology is core to our competitive advantage, as without it we would not be able to produce custom orders in small quantities while achieving the economics that are more analogous to mass produced items.
Each of our businesses uses a mix of proprietary and third-party technology that supports the specific needs of that business. Over the past few years, many of our businesses have begun to modernize and modularize their technology to enable us to launch new products, provide a better customer experience, more easily connect to our mass customization platform technologies, and, where it makes sense, to leverage third-party technologies where we do not need to bear the cost of maintaining proprietary technologies. For example, our businesses are increasingly using third-party software for capabilities such as a shopping cart or customer reviews, which are areas that we can benefit from providing a more e-commerce standard experience, and better leverage engineering resources to focus on technologies from which we derive competitive advantage.
We are currently building a mass customization platform, which is a collection of software services, application programming interfaces and related technology that can be leveraged across our businesses and third parties. Different businesses can deploy different combinations of these services, depending on what capabilities these businesses need to complement their existing technology stack. This multi-year investment is still in its early stages, though many of our businesses are leveraging some of the technologies that have already been developed and/or shared by other businesses. The capabilities that are available in the mass customization platform today include customer-facing technologies, such as those that enable customers to visualize their designs on various 
8

products, as well as manufacturing, supply chain, and logistics technologies that automate various stages of the production and delivery of a product to a customer. The anticipated benefits of the mass customization platform include improved speed to market for new product introduction, and more cost-efficient cost of production and customer delivery. Over time, we believe we can generate significant customer and shareholder value from increased specialization of production facilities, aggregated scale from multiple businesses, increased product offerings and shared technology development costs.
Technology Development 
We intend to continue developing and enhancing our customer-facing and manufacturing, supply chain and logistics technologies and processes. We have designed (and/or are upgrading) our website technologies and infrastructure to accommodate future geographic expansion and growth in the number of customer visits, orders, and product and service offerings. This architecture makes our applications highly scalable and offers our customers fast system responsiveness. In addition, our production technologies for aggregating jobs in preparation for manufacturing are designed to readily scale as we grow. We have engineering and research and development centers in multiple businesses. We also develop technology centrally, primarily at our offices in Switzerland, India, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and the United States. We are constantly seeking to strengthen our manufacturing and supply chain capabilities through engineering disciplines such as automation, manufacturing, choice of equipment, product manufacturability, materials science, process control and color control. Our technology and development expenses were approximately $243 million (11% of total revenues), $210 million (12% of total revenues) and $187 million (12% of total revenues) in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Competition
The markets for the products we produce and sell are intensely competitive, highly fragmented and geographically dispersed, with many existing and potential competitors. We compete on the basis of breadth and depth of product offerings; price; convenience; quality; technology; design content, tools, and assistance; customer service; ease of use; and production and delivery speed. It is our intention to offer a broad selection of high-quality products as well as related services at low price points and in doing so, offer our customers an attractive value proposition. Our current competition includes a combination of the following: 

• | traditional offline suppliers and graphic design providers;


• | online printing and graphic design companies, many of which provide products and services similar to ours;


• | office superstores, drug store chains, food retailers and other major retailers targeting small business and consumer markets;


• | wholesale printers;


• | self-service desktop design and publishing using personal computer software;


• | email marketing services companies;


• | website design and hosting companies;


• | suppliers of customized apparel, promotional products and gifts;


• | online photo product companies;


• | internet firms and retailers;


• | online providers of custom printing services that outsource production to third party printers; and


• | providers of other digital marketing such as social media, local search directories and other providers.

As we expand our geographic reach, product and service portfolio and customer base, our competition increases. Our geographic expansion creates competition with companies that have a multi-national presence as 
9

well as experienced local firms. Product offerings such as photo products, websites, email marketing, signage, apparel and promotional products have resulted in new competition as we entered those markets. We encounter competition from large retailers offering a wide breadth of products and highly focused companies specializing in a subset of our customers or product offerings. Given the state of maturity of the online mass customization market, we believe that in aggregate, offline providers remain our biggest competition. 
Barriers to entry have been lowered in many of our markets, and new players have entered the mass customization space, enabled by asset-light models, software-driven print-fulfillment platforms, innovation in production technology, and/or benefits of an intense focus on a niche product or geographic market. We believe that the long-term leaders in mass customization will be the companies that are innovative and agile, but also bring significant scale-based advantages to drive value to customers in the form of product selection, quality and cost, as well as service.
Environmental Responsibility
We regularly evaluate ways to minimize the impact of our operations on the environment. Our past efforts have substantially reduced the energy consumption of our operations. In fiscal 2017, we converted the vast majority of the paper we use in our Cimpress owned production facilities to FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified paper. FSC is an international non-profit organization committed to promoting the practice of sustainable forestry worldwide. FSC certification confirms that the paper comes from responsibly managed forests that meet FSC’s environmental and social standards.
Also, in fiscal 2017, we conducted an extensive planning process to reduce Cimpress’ carbon emissions at a rate in line with science-based targets established in 2015 by the United Nations Global Compact and others. As a result, we are embarking on a path to reduce emissions, through a combination of abatement measures and renewable energy sourcing. 
Intellectual Property 
We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademarks and contractual restrictions. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and business partners, and control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. 
As of June 30, 2017, we held 295 issued patents worldwide, and we continue to file new patent applications around the world. Subject to our continued payment of required patent maintenance fees, our currently issued patents will expire between December 2017 and June 2035. We hold 222 trademark registrations in various jurisdictions globally. 
Business Segment and Geographic Information 
As of June 30, 2017, our reportable operating segments consisted of (a) Vistaprint, (b) Upload and Print, which includes our druck.at, Easyflyer, Exagroup, Pixartprinting, Printdeal, Tradeprint, and WIRmachenDRUCK businesses, (c) National Pen, which includes the global operations of our National Pen business, and (d) All Other Businesses, which include our Albumprinter business, our Most of World businesses and our Corporate Solutions business. Our Most of World businesses operate in China, India and Japan and (via partial equity ownership) Brazil. For more segment and geographic information about our revenues, adjusted net operating profit and long-lived assets, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 16 — Segment Information” and Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The descriptions of our business, products, and markets in this section apply to all of our operating segments. 
Seasonality 
Our profitability has historically been highly seasonal. Our second fiscal quarter, ending December 31, includes the majority of the holiday shopping season and has become our strongest quarter for sales of our consumer-oriented products, such as holiday cards, calendars, photo books, and personalized gifts. 
10

Operating income during the second fiscal quarter represented 86%, and 62% of annual operating income in the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and during the year ended June 30, 2017, in a period we recognized a loss from operations, the second quarter remained the only profitable quarter during the year.
Employees
As of June 30, 2017, we had approximately 10,700 full-time and approximately 900 temporary employees worldwide.
