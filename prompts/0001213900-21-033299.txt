ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Crown Electrokinetics Corp. (“Crown” or the “Company”) develops and sells optical switching film that can be embedded between sheets of glass or applied to the surface of glass, or other rigid substrates such as acrylic, to electronically control opacity (“DynamicTint™”). Originally developed by Hewlett-Packard (“HP”), our technology allows a transition between clear and dark in seconds and can be applied to a wide array of windows, including commercial buildings, automotive sunroofs, and residential skylights and windows. At the core of Crown’s proprietary and patent-protected technology is a thin film that is powered by electrically charged pigment which not only replaces common window tints but is also a more sustainable alternative to traditional window treatments. Crown partners with leading glass and film manufacturers for mass production and distribution of DynamicTint.
Electrokinetic Film Technology 
 
Crown’s electrokinetic (EK) technology was derived from proprietary ink and microfluidic technology developed at HP. Electrokinetic refers to the movement of particles within a fluid under the influence of an electric field. Our EK film technology utilizes nanometer-sized pigment particles that are electrically charged and suspended in a liquid that is sandwiched between two clear substrates that are coated with a transparent conductor oxide (TCO) film. Figure 1. In a non-energized state, the suspended pigment particles are distributed uniformly between the plastic films, and will absorb, transmit, or reflect light depending on the properties of the suspended pigment (dark state). When the proper electrical signal is applied to the conductive TCO layers, an electrical field is created and the charged pigment particles collect in micro-embossed holes in a layer of polymer resin covering the transparent conductor surface. As the charged pigment particles are collected, the fluid becomes highly transparent (clear state). By applying a different electrical signal, the pigment can be dispersed back into the fluid to achieve the desired color density or opaqueness.

Our plastic films are manufactured using industry standard roll-to-roll (R2R) processing equipment. The Company believes its R2R processing will have an inherently lower manufacturing cost compared to sheet-based processing methods used for other smart window technologies like electrochromic glass. There are three basic steps to making our film using R2R equipment.
 

1) | Deposition: R2R TCO deposition on clear polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic film using vacuum sputtering of indium-tin oxide (ITO). The ITO on PET film can be provided by a number of suppliers. Millions of square feet of ITO on PET are currently provided for nearly all capacitance-based display touch screens. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Embossing: R2R embossing of UV-curable resin in a proprietary and patent protected 3-D pattern for ink pigment control and containment on one of the two plastic films. An example of the embossed pattern is shown in Figure 2. The R2R embossing process can be completed by various plastic film companies. Crown has the capability to accomplish the coating and embossing steps within its current facility in addition to working with manufacturing partners. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) | Lamination: The final R2R process laminates the two layers of PET together with the proprietary and patent protected pigment-containing fluid contained by the wall structure shown by the white areas in Figure 2. The wall area has adhesion to the upper layer of PET with ITO film thereby sealing the fluid between the two plastic layers. The fluid contains nanometer-sized pigment particles that are charged electrically and suspended in the fluid.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that DynamicTintTM has the following distinct advantages over existing optical electronic film technologies:
 

● | Neutral Color – Pigment is designed to be color neutral and will not affect the hue of what is viewed through the window in any clear, dark or tinted state. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Speed – Transition time is typically a few seconds. 
● | Affordability – Roll-to-Roll film manufacturing using relatively inexpensive materials. 
● | Low Energy Requirements – Film is low voltage and can be powered with a small battery charged by a solar cell strip or wired to an existing electrical infrastructure including a LAN line. 
● | Retro-Fit – Film can be applied to a sheet of acrylic or thin glass, called a DynamicTint Insert (“Inserts”), and placed within an existing window frame, eliminating the need to replace single pane windows with dual pane windows. 
● | Sustainable – Reduces energy used to heat or cool a room via HVAC systems and can use renewable energy to transition the film. 
● | Lease vs Purchase – Creative and flexible financing allows for customers to lease Inserts on a long-term basis and avoid large capital expenditures.

Retrofit with an Insert
 
Crown’s DynamicTintTM Smart Glass Insert is specifically designed for retrofitting in the domestic and international commercial real estate install base. DynamicTint can be laminated to other surfaces like acrylic or heat-treated glass and the laminated sheet can be assembled in DynamicTint Inserts that can be placed over the surface of existing windows (Figure 3).
 

Figure 3. Window Insert with EK Film
 
We believe Crown’s DynamicTint Inserts can be easily installed into commercial buildings, skylights, residential windows, and windows within garage doors. In commercial buildings, our DynamicTint Inserts can be used to convert existing single pane windows into dual pane windows. Crown believes that there is a significant opportunity to provide DynamicTint Inserts to commercial building owners who are looking to eliminate window blinds, gain energy efficiency, and reduce carbon emissions.
 
The Insert is a custom-sized panel comprised of a rigid substrate (acrylic or thin glass) with a silicon compliant edge seal that allows for the insert to securely fit into the interior side of the window frame.
 
Some of the Insert’s features include:
 

● | Solar-powered - eliminating the need to hardwire it into the building’s electrical system 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Wirelessly enabled - facilitating communication with all the other installed inserts and integration with the building’s management software system 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sensor equipped - enabling the Insert to auto-sense the intensity of exterior light and interior ambient light 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Software enabled - can be managed via programmed macros, dynamically managed by the building, or user-controlled within an office 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Data collection – allowing optimization of the Inserts/curtain wall energy performance 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integration with Glass 
 
Our electronic film can be cut using standard laser cutting and then laminated between panes of glass for new window construction. DynamicTint will be laminated between glass sheets for automotive applications or on a single glass sheet within an Insulated Glass Unit (IGU) (Figure 4). An IGU typically consists of two or more panes of glass that are sealed along the edges with an inert gas like Argon between the panes of glass to minimize heat transfer from one pane of glass to the other. Lower heat transfer improves insulating the outside temperature from interior temperature. Power is provided to our device by two wires connected to a single small area on each ITO surface. The wires will be routed through the IGU edge seal and can be connected to a control/power unit attached to the IGU for individual window control. The electronics driving the film can be hardwired into the building’s HVAC control system or controlled wirelessly depending on the customer’s needs. Because the overall power requirements are extremely low, localized batteries in the control unit and/or in combination with a small area solar cell can be used to power DynamicTint.

Sustainability
 
Crown is aware that working towards building a sustainable future is a common goal shared by many. Companies such as Walmart, Amazon and Apple are now publishing their sustainability pledges, and we are seeing a trend of pledging to make their workplaces more environmentally friendly.
 
Crown’s patented technology provides a solution that helps address many sustainability issues such as:
 

● | Reducing waste – as opposed to replacing single pane window units with newly manufactured dual pane windows, Crown allows building owners to install our retrofit DynamicTint Insert into existing single pane window frames thereby creating a dual pane window;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reducing energy – Crown’s DynamicTint Insert reduces HVAC energy consumption by reducing the need for constantly cooling and heating a room reducing the customers carbon emissions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Using renewable energy – Crown’s DynamicTint Insert is low voltage and low wattage and can be powered by a solar strip that captures the sun’s energy and is integrated into the Insert itself thereby eliminating the need to hardwire the Insert to the home or building’s electrical system.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crown’s DynamicTint can reduce the amount of heat entering a building by controlling the tint of external windows. According to FacilitiesNet (https://www.facilitiesnet.com/windowsexteriorwalls/article/Smart-Window-Benefit-Energy-Savings-Reduced-Glare--17280), the ability to control the amount of heat entering a building reduces the heat load of the building which in turn reduces your HVAC usage. Another benefit of DynamicTint is being able to optimize daylight usage, thereby reducing the usage of lights. A study done by Project Drawdown (https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/dynamic-glass) projected that if 30-50% of commercial building spaces install dynamic glass, the potential climate-weighted energy efficiency from cooling is estimated at 9% and lighting at 9%—depending on local climate, building location and window orientation. This can result in 0.3-0.5 gigatons of emissions reductions from decreased energy use. 
 
At Crown, we are committed to building a product that can be self-sufficient and does not require an additional power source or hard wiring into the electrical system of a residential home or commercial building. While our DynamicTint helps keep light and heat out of the building, we intend to harness that light and use it to power our inserts. This ensures that as we reduce a building’s energy consumption, we are not adding to it and are working towards being carbon neutral.
 
Intellectual Property
 
On January 31, 2016, we entered into an IP agreement with HP to acquire a research license to determine the feasibility of incorporating HP’s electrokinetic display technology in our products. On February 4, 2021, Crown and HP entered into a fourth amendment to the agreement. Pursuant to such amendment, among other items, the parties agreed to amend the list of patent and patent applications, which includes two additional patents (the “HP Patents”) that are assignable to the Company by HP upon the exercise of the Company’s option to acquire the HP Patents (the “Option”). In connection with the Company’s exercise of the Option, the Company paid HP an aggregate amount equal to One Million Five Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,550,000) on February 9, 2021. From the date of the exercise of the Option until January 1, 2030, the Company agreed to pay to HP a royalty fee based on the cumulative gross revenue received by the Company from the HP Patents as follows:

Time Window | Lifetime Cumulative Gross Revenue | Royalty Rate 
-------------------------------+---------------------------------------+-----------------
Prior to December 31, 2029 | Less than $70,000,000 | 0.00% 
$70,000,000 - $500,000,000 | 1.25% 
$500,000,000 and beyond | 1.00% 
January 1, 2030 onward | 0.00% 

 
In addition, the Company has current patent applications in the United States and other countries that if granted, would add three additional patents to its portfolio. The Company’s United States patents expire at various dates from March 26, 2029 through September 26, 2032
 
The Company believes that its EK technology is adequately protected by its patent position and by its proprietary technological know-how. However, the validity of the Company’s patents has never been contested in any litigation. The Company also possesses know-how and relies on trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect its technology. The Company requires any employee, consultant, or licensee having access to its confidential information to execute an agreement whereby such person agrees to keep such information confidential.

Business Model
 
We intend to develop and sell our patented EK Technology under the name DynamicTintTM. We intend to generate revenue by selling, and in some cases leasing, DynamicTintTM film or DynamicTint Inserts to our customers. We are in discussions with multiple building owners to buy or lease our DynamicTintTM Inserts.
 
Applications we are exploring with potential customers of Crown’s DynamicTint include:
 

● | Commercial and multi-family buildings: external windows, internal glass walls and doors for both new construction and retrofit. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Residential homes: residential windows, garage door windows, windows contained in and surrounding residential front doors as well as residential skylights. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Automotive: sunroofs and sun visors. 

 
Crown’s first product will be the DynamicTint Insert for commercial buildings. Crown’s Commercial Building Insert would allow the building owner to quickly convert its single pane window units to a dual pane window unit. Crown’s insert would act as the “second pane” and would allow the building owner to enjoy all the benefits of a dual pane window without having to replace their existing single pane windows. Crown’s insert can be integrated into the building HVAC control system, thereby optimizing the use of our DynamicTint Insert and reducing the use of the HVAC to heat or cool the rooms utilizing our technology. As Crown’s DynamicTint technology requires very little energy to effect that transition from clear to dark state, a rechargeable battery coupled with a built-in solar cell eliminates the need to hardwire the inserts to the building electrical system. Crown believes that the potential retrofit market for its DynamicTint Building Inserts is significantly large. Each unit will have wireless communication capability for control of the film and communication with the building HVAC system.
 
Crown has also developed a working prototype of an insert for the residential skylight, which allows a homeowner to control the amount of light entering the room. Crown’s DynamicTint Insert does not require the homeowner to replace their skylight as it conveniently fits into the existing frame. Crown’s skylight insert will allow a homeowner (through a Bluetooth connection or RF controller) to adjust the level of desired tint easily and quickly, thereby controlling the amount of light and heat entering the room. The DynamicTint Skylight Insert will be powered by a rechargeable lithium battery and built-in solar cell thereby eliminating the need to wire the insert to the home’s electrical system.
 
Partners and Customers
 
Crown is in active discussions with multiple glass and film manufacturers for assessment of its DynamicTint technology and its application to glass markets around the world.

Below is a table that shows the measured and calculated performance where the DynamicTint film is embedded within a glass IGU.
 


● | Crown film in double glazing with e-coating is much better than triple glazing with e-coating on two glazing with higher visible light capability. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SHGC performance is excellent and would meet window code requirements in the dark state even without the low-e coating in these calculations. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Crown’s commercialization strategies are deeply rooted in leveraging existing infrastructure. As such, Crown intends to partner with industry leading manufacturers of glass and windows as well as manufacturers of plastic film. Crown will pursue multiple paths to having its film manufactured which may include contracting manufacturing through third parties and developing its own manufacturing capabilities, or a hybrid of both.
 
As Crown moves from its research and development stage and into its commercialization stage, it has engaged with numerous existing and experienced thin film manufacturers about collaborating in the mass production of DynamicTint. Those ongoing discussions in combination with the ongoing development work with two of Crown’s existing manufacturing partners, is expected to allow Crown to move from a “development only” stage into commercialization stage in 2021.
 
Smart Glass Industry Trends 
 
We believe there are favorable converging global trends in the major near-term markets for “smart glass” products. Key factors driving the growth of the smart glass market are the growing demand for smart glass for energy savings for existing commercial and residential buildings. Added to this trend are government mandates and legislation for energy-efficient construction of both commercial and residential buildings. There is a growing opportunity for smart windows in the transportation industry including automobiles, commercial trucks, buses, and passenger rail cars.
 
In both public and private sectors across the world, there are substantial efforts targeted toward the promotion and use of energy efficient smart glass materials, including those used in automobiles, windows and other architectural glazings.
 
In September 2020, Markets and Markets issued Smart Glass Market with COVID-19 Impact by Technology (Suspended Particle Display, Electrochromic, Liquid Crystal), Application (Architecture, Transportation, Consumer Electronics), and Geography - Global Forecast to 2025. The smart glass market size is expected to grow from USD 3.8 billion in 2020 to USD 6.8 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 12.1% during the forecast period. The growth of the smart glass industry is driven by factors, such as the growing adoption of smart glass in automotive application and, declining prices for electrochromic material. Other major driving factors for smart glass adoption include supportive government mandates and legislation on energy efficiency. Governing bodies of various countries are increasingly encouraging the use of these energy-efficient products.

Smart glass has inherent energy-saving and auto-dimming properties, which reduce its maintenance cost. As a result, the perceived benefits of these glass products are more than the incurred investments.
 
Crown believes that the smart glass industry is in the initial phase of growth and that DynamicTintTM may have commercial applicability in many products where variable light-control is desired. 
 
Our Technology
 
DynamicTintTM combines many of the favorable properties of the other smart window technologies. It has fast-switching time and unlike electrochromic (EC) technology, modulation in light level is not area dependent and the film is neutral in color in all settings. Unlike Suspended Particles Devices (SPD) and Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC) technology, EK film does not need high voltage alternating current to power the film. Because of the low power requirements, EK films can be powered with batteries or combined with small area solar cells, allowing retrofit to existing windows. Furthermore, in the future EK film could be made with other colorants and it is possible with modification to the design to use two colorants in the same film, which has been demonstrated in the recent past under a research project at the University of Cincinnati. Below is a table outlining some of the typical properties of each technology.
Other Smart Glass Technologies
 
Variable light transmission technologies can be classified into two basic types: “active” technologies that can be controlled electrically by the user either automatically or manually, and “passive” technologies that can only react to ambient environmental conditions such as changes in lighting or temperature. Most of the technologies are “active”. One type that is passive is thermochromic technology where a rise in temperature will darken the film applied to glass.
 
The Company believes that our DynamicTint has certain performance advantages over other “smart glass” technologies and that pricing and product performance are the two main factors critical to the adoption of smart glass products. Because the non-EK smart glass technologies listed below do not have published, consistent pricing or cost data that can be relied upon, the Company cannot accurately report its price position relative to these other technologies. In terms of product performance, the Company believes that DynamicTint offers numerous advantages over other smart glass technologies as discussed below.

Electrochromic Glass
 
Electrochromic (EC) glass technology has been used as a light absorbing technology for rear view mirrors in automobiles for decades, and more recently for large-scale windows. However, the EC technology developed for windows is based on a different set of materials that are directly deposited on the heat-treated glass panels. All the current EC companies are using tungsten oxide as the main component involved in the color transition from clear to blue. Because of the nature of the chemical transition of the tungsten oxide, the EC film does not absorb as much of the blue light and so remaining light will have a strong blue hue both in the room and looking through the window. The speed of the switching time from dark to light or the reverse change is directly related to the size of the window area and the electrode design which brings electrical current to the EC material to start the chemical transition. EC technology is basically a battery-like material that requires “charging and discharging”. The time to charge/discharge the EC material in a large window can take up to 40 minutes to change form the dark state to the clear state at nominal temperatures. Also, during switching of the EC film, there can be non-uniform areas which can vary in level of tint from center to edge. The larger the area of the window, the more non-uniform during the change of state. Longer switching time can minimize the non-uniform areas. The EC materials are typically vacuum deposited directly on “defect-free” glass. The typical investment required for a large window electrochromic factory can run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, due to the large-scale vacuum equipment required, low particulate cleanroom required, and the relatively slow speed of deposition for all the various layers. Kinestral Technologies is using a chemical liquid deposition technique to replace some of the vacuum deposition steps to lower the capital investment needed for manufacturing.
Suspended Particle Glass (SPD)
 
SPD is a film that has suspended long and narrow particles in an encapsulated liquid polymer film with layers of ITO on either side to allow generation of an alternating current electrical field to twist the particles from a random state to a near vertical state perpendicular to the ITO plane. In the vertical state light passes through the film and in the random state the light is absorbed by the particles. The color of the film is blue since the particles used in the film do not absorb blue light as well as other colors of sunlight. No other types of particles have been created for this type of device. The film responds quickly to the electrical field, however, requires constant high AC voltage to hold the clear state. The film is manufactured on plastic and uses roll-to-roll (R2R) equipment processing. Also, because the particles are aligned when in the clear state, the film has a limited viewing angle much like older liquid-crystal displays. When viewed at a side angle, the film will appear darker. The current market for SPD has been mainly automobile sunroofs where the viewing angle of the passengers is relatively fixed at nearly perpendicular angle to the SPD film.
 
Polymer-Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC) Film
 
PDLC requires an AC electric field like the SPD film described above to achieve a clear state. However, the liquid-crystal based film can only scatter light in the power-off state, therefore, most of the incoming light is transmitted through the film (~80%). Typically, the PDLC film is used for interior windows or doors to create privacy. PDLC has similar manufacturing methods using R2R equipment and plastic film with ITO conductor to the SPD film. The film is available from many Far East manufacturing companies with some able to make ~150 cm width film. The quality of the film can vary based on the manufacturing company. The film was invented at Kent State University in the 1980’s and the patents have expired.
 
Competition
 
Several smart glass competitors have an operating history, including:
 

● | SAGE Electrochromic, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Saint-Gobain, which develops and manufactures electrochromic glass; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | View Glass [NASDAQ: VIEW] and Kinestral Technologies manufacture electrochromic glass at their purpose-built manufacturing facilities and both are headquartered in California; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Research Frontiers, Inc. [NASDAQ: REFR] licenses an electronically controlled tinted film, utilizing SPD technology, to various companies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Crown Electrokinetics expects that other competitors will emerge in the future.

Research and Development
 
Crown has been using a 6” width R2R equipment capable of handling the deposition, embossing and lamination steps of the manufacturing process for its research and development for the past three years and Crown will have its proto-manufacturing roll-to-roll equipment at 12” width available in 2021. Production prototypes for qualification and system testing will be sourced from the 12” equipment in 2021. Crown will utilize the 12” width film for the DynamicTint Skylight Insert. Larger scale manufacturing is planned at a minimum of 24” width film to address markets including larger format skylights inserts, appropriately sized residential and commercial building window inserts, and many automobile sunroofs. Thereafter, Crown will develop capability to manufacture DynamicTint of at least 60” width capability. This will allow Crown to address the vast majority of window sizes for most applications.
 
As a result of the Company’s research and development efforts, the Company believes that its EK technology is now, or with additional development will become, usable in a number of commercial products. Such products may include one or more of the following fields: “smart” windows, doors, skylights and partitions; self-dimmable automotive sunroofs, windows, sun visors, and mirrors.
 
The Company has devoted most of its financial resources to research and development activities with the goal of producing commercially viable EK products and has developed working samples of its EK technology.
 
Crown’s main goals in its research and development include:
 

● | developing wider ranges of light transmission, 
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | reducing the voltage required to operate DynamicTint, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------
