Company Overview
 
Can B̅ Corp. (the “Company,” “CAN B,” “CANB,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) was originally incorporated as WrapMail, Inc. (“WRAP”) in Florida on October 11, 2005 in order to tap into a largely un-serviced segment of the web-based advertising industry. Effective January 5, 2015, WRAP acquired 100% ownership of Prosperity Systems, Inc. (“Prosperity”), a New York corporation incorporated on April 2, 2008, in order to acquire Prosperity’s office productivity software suite as a complement to WRAP’s existing intellectual property. After its acquisition, the Company transferred Prosperity’s operations to WRAP; however, the Company does not currently actively operate its WRAP or Prosperity divisions pending decision on whether to hold on to, sell or repurpose such assets.
 
Around the first quarter of 2017, the Company began to transition into the Hemp CBD industry and now operates four distinct health and wellness divisions: retail sales (Canbiola, Nu Wellness, Seven Chakras, and Pure Leaf Oil), R&D and manufacturing (Pure Health Products and Botanical Biotech), durable medical devices (Duramed), cultivation and processing (Green Grow Farms, Inc.). On May 15, 2017, WRAP changed its name to Canbiola, Inc. to reflect its transition. On March 6, 2020 CANB changed its name to “Can B̅ Corp.” in order to segregate its corporate identity from its lead products branded under the Canbiola™ brand.
 
Effective December 27, 2010, WRAP effected a 10 for 1 forward stock split of its common stock. Effective June 4, 2013, WRAP effected a 1 for 10 reverse stock split of its common stock. On March 6, 2020, Can B̅ effected a 1 for 300 reverse stock split of its common stock. The accompanying consolidated financial statements retroactively reflect these stock splits.
 
Business Segments
 
The Company is in the business of promoting health and wellness through its development, manufacture and sale of products containing cannabinoids derived from hemp biomass (without psychoactive effect from THC) and the licensing of durable medical devises.
 
Hemp is thought to contain anywhere from 60 to over 100 naturally occurring compounds (cannabinoids) thought to interact with cannabinoid receptors present on the surface of cells in various parts of the central nervous system. The effects of cannabinoids are thought to depend on the area of the brain involved. Cannabidiol (“CBD”) is probably one of the most well-known of these compounds, thought to have many beneficial uses. CBD is incorporated into many of the Company’s products; however, the Company has just recently begun extracting cannabinol (“CBN”) and cannabigerol (“CBG”) for wholesale to third-parties looking to incorporate such compounds into their products. The Company has all of its hemp based raw materials to incorporated into products tested by a 3rd party independent laboratory. The Company aims to be the premier provider of the highest quality natural hemp CBD products on the market through sourcing the very best raw material and developing a variety of products it believes will improve people’s lives in a variety of areas.

I- | Retail Sales 
---+---------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company currently has four in-house branded CBD products that are sold to consumers, Canbiola™, Nu Wellness™, Seven Chakras™ and Pure Leaf Oil™. On February 22, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase additional CBD brand assets from Imbibe Health Solutions, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The assets will be placed into the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Imbibe Wellness Solutions, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (fka Radical Tactical LLC) (“Imbibe”), and will include the intellectual property rights, including trademarks, logos, know how, formulations, productions procedures, copyrights, social media accounts, domain names and marketing materials relating to the Imbibe™ branded products, including a muscle and joint salve, unscented fizzy bath soak, CALM massage oil, Me x 3 Metabolic Energy (energy and dietary supplement), and Muscle, Joints & Back CBD Cryo Gel. The acquisition of the Imbibe™ assets has not closed and is pending the Company’s due diligence.
 
The Company’s Canbiola™ CBD products are sold via medical professionals under distribution agreements and directly by the Company via its website and vending machines. The Canbiola™ assets are held directly by the Company and include tinctures, soaps, bath soaks, cryo-gel, salves, massage oils, powders, capsules and roll-ons.
 
The Company’s Pure Leaf Oil™ assets are held by its wholly owned subsidiary, Pure Health Products, LLC, a New York limited liability company (“PHP” or “Pure Health Products”). Pure Leaf Oil™ CBD products are sold via PHP’s website, direct to consumer via walk-in business, and through distributors and are meant for retail customers not referred through the medical community. Pure Leaf Oil™ products include massage oils, joint salves, bath salts, nano sprays, drops, and cryo-gels. PHP also holds the assets related to its Seven Chakras™ brand. Seven Chakras™ is targeted toward health clubs, spas, and beauty lines and CBD products include lotion, massage oils, roll-ons, isolate, powders, capsules, and bath soaks. Severn Chakras™ has its own internet website and direct markets to its customer base.
 
PHP has also created a new brand, Nu Wellness™, which it intends to market through distributors as an independent pharmacy brand targeted towards independent retail drug stores. Nu Wellness™ has yet to launch or make sales, which are intended to occur sometime in 2021.
 

II- | R&D and Manufacturing 
----+--------------------------

 
To date, Pure Health Products has acted as the Company’s research and development and manufacturing arm. PHP manufactures all of the Company’s CBD products and also provides white label manufacturing and production services to third parties. Through PHP, the Company is able to control the manufacturing process of its products while reducing its production costs.
 
In December, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests in Pure Health Products, with which it had had and has an exclusive production agreement, pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement (“PHP Acquisition Agreement”). In January, 2019, PHP acquired certain assets from Seven Chakras, LLC (“Seven Chakras”), a former competitor, which assets included the rights and title to (i) Seven Chakras’ proprietary formulas, methods, trade secrets, and know-how related to the production of Seven Chakras’ CBD products, (ii) Seven Chakras’ tradename, domain name, and social media sites, and (iii) other assets of Seven Chakras including but not limited to raw materials, equipment, packaging and labeling materials, mailing lists, and marketing materials.
 
Around March 17, 2021, the Company acquired assets through its newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary, Botanical Biotech, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“BB”or “Botanical Biotech”). Such assets include certain materials and manufacturing equipment and marketing or promotional designs, brochures, advertisements, concepts, literature, books, media rights, rights against any other person or entity in respect of any of the foregoing and all other promotional properties, in each case primarily used, developed or acquired by the Sellers for use in connection with the ownership and operation of the BB Assets. BB has also engaged certain sellers of the BB assets and lab technicians in order to perform research and development and manufacturing of CBG and CBN products to be sold to third parties for incorporation into their products. The Company does not at this time intend to develop or market its own products containing CBG or CBN.

III- | Durable Medical Equipment 
-----+------------------------------

 
Through its medical device division, Duramed, Inc. (“Duramed”) and Duramed MI LLC, a Nevada limited liability company fka DuramedNJ, LLC (“Duramed MI”), the Company serves the post-surgery medical patient arena aiming to aid in recovery and pain reduction.
 
In November 2018, the Company formed Duramed, Inc. to facilitate the manufacture and sale of durable medical equipment (“DME”) incorporating CBD. On January 14, 2019, Duramed entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “Sam MOU”) with Sam International (“Sam”) and ZetrOZ Systems LLC (“ZetrOZ” and, collectively with Sam, the “Manufacturers”). Pursuant to the Sam MOU, the Manufacturers granted Duramed the exclusive right to distribute sam® Pro 2.0 (SA271) and sam® Gel Coupling Patches (UB-14-72) within the United States for the Personal Injury Protection/No Fault Market during the term of the Sam MOU. Duramed has agreed to purchase monthly minimums from the Manufacturers at a price per Unit of $2,447. The exclusivity of the Distribution License granted to Duramed under the Sam MOU was dependent upon meeting the monthly minimum, which did not happen. In addition, Duramed was granted the right to distribute sam® Gel Capture Patches (UB-14-24). Duramed will get rebates of 2%-3% based on the volume of products sold by it. We did not meet the monthly minimums as contemplated by the Sam MOU and as such we are currently distributing the aforementioned products on an at-will, non-exclusive basis.
 
On May 29, 2019, the Company created Duramed MI to execute the same business strategy into the no-fault insurance market in New Jersey that it had developed in New York; however, Duramed MI is not currently operating in NJ and is in the process of moving its operations to Michigan, which have not begun yet.
 

IV- | Hemp Production, Aggregation, Processing, and Sale 
----+-------------------------------------------------------

 
On July 11, 2019, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with NY – SHI, LLC, a New York limited liability company (“NY – SHI”), EWSD I LLC dba SHI Farms, a Delaware limited liability company (“SHI Farms”), Pivt Labs, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company fka NY Hemp Depot LLC (“Pivt”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CANB . Pursuant to the JV Agreement, NY – SHI and Pivt entered into a joint venture for the purpose of jointly implementing a business model to aggregate and purchase fully-grown, harvested industrial hemp from third-party farmers in the State of New York. The Joint Venture was not formally consummated and has been disbanded, with the parties executing a settlement agreement. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, NY – Shi agreed to return all shares issued to it under the JV Agreement (which return has yet to be processed) but was permitted to keep the cash payment of $500,000.00 made to it by the Company. Before the end of the joint venture NY – SHI’s cultivating license was amended to add Pivt. Pivt currently has no operations but the Company does intend to use it for hemp cultivation in the future, if and when it becomes economically viable to do so.
 
On December 4, 2019, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “GGFI Agreement” with Iconic Brands, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“ICNB”) and Green Grow Farms, Inc., a New York corporation (“GGFI” or “Green Grow” and, collectively with ICNB and the Company, the “Parties”). Pursuant to the terms of the GGFI Agreement, at closing, the Company received 51% equity interest in Green Grow (the “GG Shares”) in exchange for an aggregate of 125,000 (post split) shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Purchase Shares”). On June 30, 2020 (the “Valuation Date”), a valuation of the Purchase Shares was to be (and was) performed for the purpose of determining whether the Market Price Per Purchase Share (as defined in the GGFI Agreement) on the Valuation Date was less than $1,000,000. In the event that the aggregate Market Price Per Purchase Share on the Valuation Date was less than $1,000,000, the Company was to issue to the ICNB such a number of additional shares (“Additional Purchase Shares”) so that the aggregate value of aggregate shares issued to ICNB for the purchase of the GG Shares (taking into account the Purchase Shares and the Additional Purchase Shares) equaled $1,000,000. For purposes of the valuation, Market Price Per Purchase Share was to be determined based upon the 10-day average VWAP for the 10-day period ending on June 30, 2020. On June 30, 2020, it was determined that ICNB was owed an additional 418,714 shares, which it was issued.

On March 3, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement (the “Modification Agreement”) with Green Grow, New York Farm Group, Inc., a New York corporation (“NYFG”), Steven Apolant, an individual, and Peter Scalise, an individual, relating to the GGFI Agreement, as amended. Following the closing of the GGFI Agreement, the Company discovered that certain assets of GGFI were valued at less than the amount GGFI had previously represented. In light of the foregoing, pursuant to the Modification Agreement, NYFG agreed to assign to CANB (i) all of the equity interests in GGFI held by NYFG and (ii) 1,000,000 shares of ICNB’s common stock. Each party to the Modification Agreement also agreed to release the other parties thereto from all claims relating to the GGFI Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. As a result of the transaction contemplated by the Modification Agreement, the Company now owns 100% of GGFI. On July 29, 2020, ICNB entered into an agreement whereby ICNB agreed to exchange its CANB Shares for CANB’s 1,000,000 ICNB shares.
 
Through GGFI, the Company grew its own hemp in New York and partnered with third party growers in other states whereby GGFI provided the farmers with seed and training and splits profits with the farmers. GGFI was to supply the Company with all hemp needed for the Company to produce its CBD products, which hemp would be processed by a third party and shipped to the Company’s production facility in Lacey, WA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, currently, it is less expensive to buy CBD isolate than to produce the isolate from hemp grown by the Company. Accordingly, the Company has stopped its Green Grow operations in favor of buying raw products from third parties. If and when it makes economic sense to grow its own hemp again, the Company will resume Green Grow operations.
 

V- | Lifestyle Brands 
---+---------------------

 
On January 28, 2020, the Company entered into a License Agreement (the “Lifeguard Agreement”) with LIFEGUARD LICENSING CORP., a Delaware corporation (“Lifeguard”). Pursuant to the Lifeguard Agreement, Lifeguard granted the Company the right to use its LIFEGUARD® trademark (the “Mark”) in connection with the Company’s manufacture, marketing, distribution, and sale of products (the “License”). Due to COVID 19, the Company was delayed in its production of LIFEGUARD® products and has yet to begin such production. Consequently, the Company is in negotiations with Lifeguard to terminate the License and each walk-away. The Company and Lifeguard have yet to execute the settlement agreement but have agreed on terms, being that the Lifeguard Agreement will be terminated, the parties will release any potential claims they may have against one another and the Company will deliver to Lifeguard any promotional or marketing materials and samples developed by the Company under the License.
 
Competitive Conditions
 
The CBD and cannabis markets are flooded with competition ranging from mom and pop operations to multi-million-dollar conglomerates, many with longer operating histories, more capital and/or more industry knowledge than the Company. The Company hopes to partner with or engage industry specialists to help set it apart from its numerous competitors. The Company believes that one of those points of differentiation will be its 3rd party independent testing “Certificate of Analysis” conducted on all of the CBD isolate products it purchases and posting of those lab results on its website. The three largest CBD companies known to the Company are Elixinol LLC, a UK based company with $37 million revenue, GW Pharmaceuticals also UK based with $19 million revenue, and Aurora Cannabis based in Canada with just over $19 million revenue. The top USA companies include Medical Marijuana, CV Sciences, Gaia Herbs, and Charlotte’s Web with respective revenues of $59, $48, $45, and $17 million. Worthy of note is that Charlotte’s Web is on the shelf right next to us at Northwell health.

Hemp and CBD biomass has glutted the US market, benefiting our manufacturing divisions with less expensive product but causing our hemp cultivation and processing division to become financially imprudent until the oversupply issue has resolved. Thus, we have halted operations in such division for the time being but may resume such operations should a sound opportunity present. Although we have contract farm agreements in place to grow and harvest well over 100 acres of hemp biomass in three states, other raw materials for our finished products have at least three sources of supply in the open market and we have little risk of any ingredient supply at this time.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We won the following patents for our WRAPmail technology: US Patent no. 8572275 issued on October 29, 2013. This patent expires in October 2022.

The above patents relate to the document management and email marketing divisions which are not presently being developed. Due to diminishing revenue from this division, the Company accountant determined to reduce the fair value of these patents to $0.
 
The Company employs through its Pure Health Product LLC division, two full time product researchers and developers and technology experts who, on a daily basis, set the quality standards and new product development status and time-line agendas under the direct supervision of the Company’s management team.

Research and Development
 
In fiscal year 2020 and 2019 we spent $165,000 and $150,000 respectively, in research and development which was expensed as spent.
 
Government Regulation
 
The cultivation and sale of hemp and hemp products is federally regulated under the United States Farm Bill. The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp as a Schedule 1 Substance under the Controlled Substances Act; however, rules and regulations relating to manufacture and sale of CBD products under the Farm Bill must still be promulgated and are expected to impact the Company’s operations. As the CBD industry and our product lines expand, it is uncertain what other statutory schemes and agencies will start to regulate our CBD products. The FDA currently still considers the addition of CBD to food products, cosmetics or supplements to be illegal and prohibits the advertisement of CBD products with health claims. The Company must also comply with each state’s laws relating to the sale of hemp-based CBD products, with some states allowing the sale of CBD, some states limiting to medical purposes and some states banning outright. These regulations may affect, among others, the way the Company manufactures and distributes its products, the way the Company is taxed, the way the Company banks, the location of the Company’s facilities, the content and testing of the Company’s products, and the quality of the Company’s services. The Company has not sought or received approval of any of its products from the FDA or any state agency. Should the Company be sanctioned by the FDA or state agencies, it could materially, negatively impact the Company’s operations and revenue sources.
 
We are also subject to general business regulations and laws as well as Federal and state regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the Internet, e-commerce or other online services, and increase the cost of providing online services. These regulations and laws may cover sweepstakes, taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. Unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business and results of operations. CBD sales are additionally state regulated for shipping and the Company maintains a current list.
 
Transfer Agent
 
We have engaged Transhare Corporation located at 2849 Executive Drive, Suite 200, Clearwater, FL 33762 as our transfer agent.
