ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 15, 2006, as Jupiter Resources, Inc. Our name was changed to Rineon Group, Inc. on April 30, 2009, and AS Capital, Inc. on October 1, 2018. On August 6, 2020, we consummated a share exchange transaction with the shareholders of HanJiao International Holding Limited, its subsidiaries and variable interest entity, Beijing Luji Technology Co., Ltd. (“Beijing Luji”). As a result of the share exchange transaction, we entered into the business of providing health and wellness related products through our e-commerce platform to the middle-aged and elderly populations in the People’s Republic of China (“China” or the “PRC”) through our variable interest entity, Beijing Luji. On October 20, 2020, we changed our name to Hanjiao Group, Inc. The shares of our common stock are currently quoted under the symbol “HJGP.”
 
Beijing Luji, previously known as Beijing Luji Culture Media Co. Ltd., a variable interest entity that we control through contractual arrangements, was formed in Beijing, China, on March 27, 2007. Initially, Beijing Luji focused on the provision of services in paper media, publication of magazines and books, and investment in media businesses. Due to the downturn of the paper media industry and the rise of the elderly healthcare services industry, in 2013 Beijing Luji shifted its business focus to the provision of healthcare related products through its e-commerce platform to the middle-aged and elderly segments in the PRC.
 
In 2016, Beijing Luji expanded its e-commerce operations and introduced its “Fozgo” branded products via its online to offline (O2O) marketplace. The O2O platform integrates its e-commerce platform with physical outlets to connect consumers and merchants in a dynamic marketplace. Its platform not only offers users the convenience of making online purchases, but also provides users the possibility to purchase and receive products at offline service centers. Currently, Beijing Luji’s core product categories include nutritional supplements, cosmetics, smart home products (such as smart watches) and home appliances (such as water filters and air purifiers). Beijing Luji has developed several branch offices with outlets across the PRC with approximately 160,000 users. In 2018, Beijing Luji was granted hi-tech enterprise status in the PRC. 
 
Beijing Luji owns a 44% equity interest in Rongcheng Tianrun Taxus Co., Ltd. (“Rongcheng Tianrun”), a PRC company. Rongcheng Tianrun is engaged primarily in the cultivation and marketing of Taxus, a type of medicinal plant.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at Room 1206, 12th Floor, 301, 3-17 F, Building 5, Block 1, Hangfeng Road, Fengtai District, Beijing and our telephone number is +86-10-63622901. We currently operate 12 branches and approximately 190 service centers, serving approximately 160,000 users throughout the PRC. We maintain an Internet website at www.lujiguoji.com. The information contained in, or accessible from, our website is not a part of this Annual Report.
 
History
 
We were incorporated on June 15, 2006 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Jupiter Resources, Inc with 75,000,000 shares of common stock and no other classes of stock authorized. On March 27, 2007, we entered into an agreement with Ms. Helen Louise Robinson of Vernon, British Columbia, whereby she agreed to sell to us one mineral claim located approximately 30 kilometers northwest of Vernon, British Columbia in an area having the potential to contain silver or copper mineralization or deposits. In order to acquire a 100% interest in this claim, we paid $7,500 to Ms. Robinson. However, we were unable to keep the mineral claim in good standing due to lack of funding and our interest in it lapsed.
 
On March 25, 2009, the Company’s articles of incorporation were amended to authorize an addition of 10 million preferred shares making a total of 85,000,000 shares authorized (75 million common stock, 10 million preferred stock).

On March 30, 2009, Jupiter entered into a binding letter of intent with NatProv Holdings, Inc., a British Virgin Islands corporation (“Natprov”). Pursuant to the terms of the letter of intent, Natprov and the Company were to commence the negotiation and preparation of a definitive share exchange agreement which contained customary representations, warranties and indemnities as agreed upon by Natprov, the Company and the shareholders of Natprov, whereby the Company, Natprov and the shareholders of Natprov were to complete a share exchange transaction (the “Transaction”) on or before May 26, 2009, subject to certain conditions precedent to the closing of the Transaction.
 
On April 30, 2009, the Company filed an amendment to change the name of the corporation to Rineon Group, Inc.
 
On May 01, 2009, we filed a Certificate of Designation to designate 36,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, out of the 10 million preferred stock. These shares have no votes for matters brought before the common shareholders, only with matters regarding the Series A shares where they will be the only voters. They can convert into common but cannot at any time convert to hold more than 4.95% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company.
 
On May 14, 2009, we entered into a preferred stock purchase agreement dated as of April 30, 2009 (the “Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement”) under which the Company sold an aggregate of 36,000 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) to Intigy Absolute Return Ltd., a British Virgin Islands corporation (“Intigy”), for a purchase price of $36,000,000, or $1,000 per share of Series A $0.001 Par Value Preferred Stock. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement dated as of May 14, 2009, the Company agreed to acquire 1,985,834 shares of Amalphis Group, Inc., (“Amalphis”) from Natprov for a total consideration of $36,000,000. Of the 2,437,500 shares of Amalphis held by Natprov, 1,985,834 were converted into Class A Preferred non-voting shares, which were then assigned by Natprov to the Company. As a result, Natprov owned 451,666 Common Shares of Amalphis, representing 100% of the voting shares of Amalphis, and the Company owned 1,985,834 of Amalphis’ Class A Preferred Shares which have the same rights and privileges as the common shares except that they have a liquidation preference and no voting rights. Amalphis’ Class A Preferred Shares were not convertible into Common Shares.
 
The transactions consummated as set forth above resulted in a change of control of the Company. In connection with such change in control, on May 14, 2009, the board of directors of the Company authorized a change in the fiscal year end of the Company from May 31 to December 31.
 
Amalphis was formed in July 2008 as a British Virgin Islands (BVI) Business Company. Amalphis, through its wholly owned subsidiary Allied Provident, Inc. (“API”), offers customized reinsurance products in markets where traditional reinsurance alternatives are limited. In addition, Amalphis was formed to directly sell a variety of property and casualty insurance products to businesses around the world. In September 2008, Amalphis acquired API, an entity that issues customized reinsurance to a United States insurance carrier that offers automotive insurance coverage to drivers who are unable to obtain insurance from standard carriers. API was formed in Barbados on November 9, 2007 by Natprov, a British Virgin Islands corporation.
 
There was no business activity between the filing of the Form 15 on November 10, 2010, and prior to August 9, 2018. The Company had Exchange Act disclosure requirements from January 11, 2008 to November 10, 2010. The Company has no knowledge or records related to the assets referenced above and therefor there is some level of uncertainty in the above descriptions.
 
Prior management of the Company was unresponsive to shareholders and had refused to respond to requests to meet statutory requirements to get current with the secretary of state and with the required filings of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 
On August 9, 2018, XTC, Inc. was appointed to serve as the custodian of a shareholder filed action with the Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada and was instructed to revive the Company. XTC, Inc. was a shareholder of record as shown in the court documents (500 shares) attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report. XTC acquired its 500 common shares on June 14, 2018 in the open market at a price of $0.05 per share.

Market Overview
 
Home Appliances: Water Purifiers and Air Purifiers
 
COVID-19 had an adverse impact on the water purifier market in China. According to Aoweiyun’s (“AVC)” April 2020 report, the size of the water purifier market was approximately RMB 29 billion (approximately USD 4.5 billion) in 2020, representing a year-on-year decrease of 6.1%. The epidemic has also intensified consumers’ doubts regarding the safety of their water supply both from the tap and from bottled sources. Notwithstanding the immediate adverse impact of COVID-19 on the market, increased consumer concern regarding water safety together with normal replacement demand is expected to fuel the demand for water purifiers over the next 1-2 years.
 
According to AVC, the offline air purifier market experienced a significant decline during the pandemic’s most severe periods, which decline was slightly offset by a spike in online sales. However, with the improvement in the management of the pandemic together with other factors, online sales of purifiers in China gradually returned to their pre-pandemic levels while offline sales remained down. In 2020, the annual sales volume of the purifier market was approximately RMB 6.26 billion (approximately USD 0.97 billion), down 30.9% year-on-year, with a sales volume of approximately 3.8 million units, down 18.5% year-on-year. The air purifier market is expected to gradually recover with 2021 sales volume forecasted to be approximately RMB 5.74 billion (approximately USD 0.9 billion), down 8.3% year-on-year, and unit sales to be 3.7 million units, down 2.9% year-on-year.
 
Health and Wellness Market
 
According to the "2016-2021 China Nutrition and Health Products Industry Market Analysis and Investment Prospects Consulting Report" issued by the China Business Industry Research Institute, China’s nutrition and health and wellness industry is expected to maintain a growth trend over the next few years with 2020 sales revenue in China reaching approximately RMB 480.3 billion (approximately USD 74 billion).  Chinese consumers devote approximately 0.07% of their total expenditure on health and wellness products, as compared to consumers in Europe and the United States who spend an average of 25% of total expenditure. Health and wellness related expenditures of urban and rural residents in mainland China have been growing rapidly, much higher than the growth rate of developed countries. We believe that the health and wellness will continue to grow in the near future.

Cosmetics Market
 
According to iMedia Research, China’s cosmetics market has grown steadily from approximately RMB 248.4 billion (approximately USD 38.4 billion) in 2012 to approximately RMB 425.6 billion (approximately USD 65.7 billion) in 2019. China’s cosmetics market was adversely affected by COVID-19 as government mask mandates, forced closures and other factors lead to a decline in cosmetics use resulting in the market shrinking to approximately 395.8 billion (approximately USD 61 billion) in 2020. According to iMedia Research, China's cosmetics market is expected to recover and reach approximately RMB 455.3 billion (approximately USD 70 billion) in 2021, with live-streaming sales mode becoming mainstream.
Smart Home Market
 
According to the “2020 China Smart Hardware Industry Development Panorama Research Report” released by iMedia Research, China’s smart home market has experienced continuous grown from RMB 62 billion (approximately USD 9.6 billion) in 2016 to approximately RMB153 billion (approximately USD 23.6 billion) in 2019, with a growth rate of 146 %. Although the overall market growth rate has been affected by the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020, the growth fundamentals have not been changed, and the market size is estimated to be approximately RMB 170.5 billion (approximately USD 26.3 billion). We believe that China’s smart home market is large and will continue to experience growth in the near future.
 
Our first smart home product is smart watches, which are pre-loaded with applications (such as exercise application, application that monitors heart rates, and location application) that we believe are beneficial to our target market segments. Over the next twelve to eighteen months, and under the right economic terms and conditions, we hope to partner with third parties to introduce to our platform additional smart products that focus on the health and wellness of the elderly population.
 

Products
 
We are engaged in the business of selling health and wellness and other related products to the middle-aged and elderly market segments in China. Our core product categories include nutritional supplements, cosmetics, smart home products (such as smart watches) and home appliances (such as water filters and air purifiers). We also sell our own branded “Fozgo” products and third-party products through our website. We are focused on creating our national sales network and establishing our marketing channels to capitalize on our brand advantages.
 
A majority of the products sold since 2019 were “Fozgo” branded nutrition supplements. During the period of 12 months ended December 31, 2020, revenues were mainly attributable to sales of cosmetics, health and wellness products and smart watches, representing 34.3%, 28%, and 19.2% of revenues, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the top products categories were health foods, home appliances and cosmetics, representing 70.92%, 11.38% and 7.32% of the revenue, respectively.
 
Platform Users
 
Beijing Luji has approximately 160,000 users as of March 30, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the number of new users increased by approximately 2,000 users, or 1%, from approximately 158,000 users for the year ended December 31, 2019. The users are from over 27 provinces and cities across the PRC.

Sales and Marketing
 
We create awareness of our brand and products directly through several channels: conferences and events marketing, social media platforms, and cross collaboration with business partners.
 

· | Conference and events marketing: We have historically relied on live conferences and events as the main driver for marketing and selling our products. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded into holding virtual conferences and events. We anticipate continuing our virtual conference and marketing events in the foreseeable future, even as China’s economy begins recovering from the effects of the pandemic. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Social Media Platforms: We promote our products on various social media platforms such as WeChat, etc. 
· | Business Partners: We actively seek businesses for brand partnerships to cross-promote our brand, products. 
· | Referral and Resellers: We actively encourage the development of a community of resellers and outlets that will be incentivized to sell our products. We expect to rely on conferences and events to develop new resellers and new outlets in new provinces across the PRC. We also plan to attract more new users by using WeChat QR code and the Internet. 

Strategy for Growth
 
The outbreak of COVID-19 that started in late January 2020 in the PRC had negatively affected our business. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic and has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of stores and business facilities in China and the U.S. in the subsequent months. Given the rapidly expanding nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, and because substantially all of the Company’s business operations and its workforce are concentrated in China, the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition for 2020 have been adversely affected. In our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have included a note about our ability to continue as a going concern due to, among other factors, significant decline in our operating cash flows and significant operating loss in 2020 as a result of COVID-19.
 
Management believes that COVID-19 could continue to have a material impact on our financial results during the first half of 2021, and could affective our ability to realize certain assets. To mitigate the overall financial impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business, management has worked closely with our service centers to enhance our marketing activities designed to promote awareness of our product offerings and generate sales in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021. We have also introduced cost containment and staff reduction measures, decreasing our headcount from 70 employees at the beginning of 2020 to 43 as of March 30, 2021. Assuming a significant easing of COVID related restrictive measures, and our ability to recruit, attract and retain key sales members, we believe that we could generate sufficient cashflow over the next 12 months to implement our revised business plan.
 
We are focused on promoting our O2O cloud platform to middle-aged and elderly market segments in the PRC. Our strategies include:
 

1. | Increasing the number of offline service outlets and stores, enhancing the user experience in the O2O business model, and increasing branches across China. We operate 12 branches and 197 service centers throughout the PRC as of March 30, 2021. Assuming a significant easing of COVID related restrictive measures and our ability to recruit, attract and retain key sales members during this time, in 2021 and 2022, we hope to increase our reach as set forth below.

Near-Term Requirements for Additional Capital 
 
For the immediate future, we intend to finance our business and strategic plans including possible corporate transactions such as asset or business acquisitions through sales of our securities to existing shareholders, management or employees as well as loans from existing shareholders or financial institutions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms, that that we will be successful in consummating a business acquisition or that any acquired business will be successful after acquisition. While our operating performance in 2020 was negatively impacted by COVID-19, we believe our business will begin to stabilize in the second half of 2021, and that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed above will be adequate to support operations for at least the next 12 months. We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares and shareholder loans in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our plan of operations.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect the “Fozgo” brand of Beijing Luji. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property increase our business cost and harm our operating results.
 
The laws of the PRC may not protect our brand and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. We may be unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights in our country. Further, companies in the internet, social media technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of their intellectual property rights.
 
We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level of protection afforded by the particular jurisdiction. Initially, we expect that our revenue will be derived principally from our operations in the PRC where intellectual property protection may be more limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection of our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of our findings.
 
We intend to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend to protect our trademarks against infringement and also seek protection of registered design and product patent.
 
We rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. We expect that, where applicable, we will require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. We expect these agreements to provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The agreements will also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of the Company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.
