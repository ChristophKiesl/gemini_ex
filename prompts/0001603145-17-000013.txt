Item 1.  Business
NEP is a growth-oriented limited partnership formed by NEE to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable long-term cash flows. At December 31, 2016, NEP owns a controlling, non-economic general partner interest and a 34.8% limited partner interest in NEP OpCo. Through NEP OpCo, NEP owns a portfolio of contracted renewable generation assets consisting of wind and solar projects, as well as seven contracted natural gas pipeline assets.
NEP expects to take advantage of trends in the North American energy industry, including the addition of clean energy projects as aging or uneconomic generation facilities are phased out, increased demand from utilities for renewable energy to meet state RPS requirements, improving competitiveness of energy generated from wind and solar projects relative to energy generated using other fuels and increased demand for natural gas transportation. NEP plans to focus on high-quality, long-lived projects operating under long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties that are expected to produce stable long-term cash flows. NEP believes its cash flow profile, geographic, technological and resource diversity, cost-efficient business model and relationship with NEE provide NEP with a significant competitive advantage and enable NEP to execute its business strategy.
NEP was formed as a Delaware limited partnership in March 2014 as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NEE. On July 1, 2014, NEP completed its IPO by issuing 18,687,500 common units at a price to the public of $25 per unit. The proceeds from the IPO, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and structuring fees, were approximately $438 million, of which NEP used approximately $288 million to purchase 12,291,593 common units of NEP OpCo from NEE Equity and approximately $150 million to purchase 6,395,907 NEP OpCo common units from NEP OpCo. Subsequent to the IPO, NEP issued a total of 35,549,495 additional common units and purchased an additional 35,549,495 NEP OpCo common units.

At December 31, 2016, NEP's clean energy projects and pipelines, excluding its non-economic ownership interests, are as follows:
Each of the renewable energy projects sells substantially all of its output and related renewable energy attributes pursuant to long-term, fixed price PPAs to various counterparties. The pipelines primarily operate under long-term firm transportation contracts where counterparties pay for a fixed amount of capacity that is reserved by the counterparties and also generate revenues based on the volume of natural gas transported on the pipelines. During 2016, NEP derived approximately 19%, 18% and 16% of its consolidated revenues from its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Mex Gas Supply S.L. and the IESO, respectively. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately $136 million, $136 million and $95 million, respectively, of NEP's consolidated revenues were attributable to its Canadian operations. In addition, NEP's 2016 and 2015 revenues included approximately $129 million and $18 million, respectively, of revenues attributable to its contract with a subsidiary of Pemex. At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, NEP's total net long-lived assets, including construction work in progress, located in Canada amounted to approximately $881 million, $879 million and $1,075 million, respectively. See Item 1A for a discussion of risks related to NEP's operations in Canada and NEP's business relationship with Pemex.
In connection with the IPO, NEP entered into a ROFO agreement with NEER and NEP OpCo that, among other things, provides NEP OpCo with a right of first offer to acquire the NEER ROFO projects, if NEER should seek to sell any of these projects. NEP believes that the NEER ROFO projects have many of the characteristics of the renewable energy projects in its current portfolio, including long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties and recently constructed, long-lived facilities that NEP believes will generate stable cash flows. Under the ROFO agreement, however, NEER is not obligated to offer to sell any of the NEER ROFO projects. In addition, in the event that NEER elects to sell any of the NEER ROFO projects, NEER is not required to accept any offer NEP OpCo makes to acquire any NEER ROFO project and, following the completion of good faith negotiations, may choose to sell the project to third parties or not to sell the project at all. NEER is not obligated to offer NEP OpCo the NEER ROFO projects at prices or on terms that are consistent with NEP's business strategy. The NEER ROFO projects as of December 31, 2016 include contracted wind and solar projects in the U.S. and Canada with a combined capacity of approximately 1,076 MW. 
Effective July 2014, NEP and certain subsidiaries of NEP entered into the MSA with an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NEE, under which operational, management and administrative services are provided to NEP, including managing NEP’s day-to-day affairs and providing individuals to act as NEP GP’s executive officers and directors, in addition to those services that are provided under O&M agreements and ASAs between NEER subsidiaries and NEP subsidiaries. NEP OpCo pays NEE an annual management fee and makes certain payments to NEE based on the achievement by NEP OpCo of certain target quarterly distribution levels to its unitholders (incentive distribution rights fees, or IDRs). See Note 11 - Management Services Agreement.
In addition, effective October 2015, subsidiaries of NEP entered into transportation agreements and a fuel management agreement with a subsidiary of NEE. See Note 11 - Transportation and Fuel Management Agreements.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
U.S. Renewable Energy Industry
Growth in renewable energy is largely attributable to the increasing cost competitiveness of renewable energy driven primarily by government incentives, RPS, improving technology and declining installation costs and the impact of increasingly stringent environmental rules and regulations on fossil-fired generation.
U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various incentives to support the development of renewable energy. These incentives make the development of renewable energy projects more competitive by providing accelerated depreciation, tax credits or grants for a portion of the development costs, decreasing the costs associated with developing such projects or creating demand for renewable energy assets through RPS programs. In addition, RPS provide incentives to utilities to contract for energy generated from renewable energy providers.
Renewable energy technology has improved and installation costs have declined meaningfully in recent years. Wind technology is improving as a result of taller towers, longer blades and more efficient energy conversion equipment, which allow wind projects to more efficiently capture wind resource and produce more energy. Solar technology is also improving as solar cell efficiencies improve and solar equipment costs decline.
Fossil-fired plants emit greenhouse gases (GHG) and other pollutants. A number of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules have been proposed that are expected to impact many coal-fired plants in the U.S. While there is some uncertainty as to the timing and requirements that will ultimately be imposed by these proposed rules (see discussion of the Clean Power Plan in Environmental Matters - Regulation of GHG emissions below), NEP expects that the owners of some of the smaller, older or less efficient coal-fired plants will choose to decommission these facilities rather than make the significant investments that will be necessary to comply with environmental rules and regulations. In addition, NEP expects the current relatively low natural gas prices will affect the decision whether to make such investments.
Canadian Renewable Energy Industry
Canada is a world leader in the production and use of clean energy as a percentage of its total energy needs. Capacity additions are expected to be required throughout Canada in order to replace aging projects and meet growing demand. While a majority of Canada’s electricity is generated by hydro energy plants, non-hydro renewable energy is providing an increasing portion of Canada’s energy.
The Canadian energy industry is also benefiting from the increased competitiveness of renewable energy, due in part to improving technology and declining installation costs. Furthermore, government targets and incentives at the provincial level continue to drive the growth of renewable energy in Canada. Ontario, in particular, has been a leader in supporting the development of renewable energy in Canada.
U.S. Natural Gas Pipeline Transportation Industry
The increase in natural gas production in the U.S. has led to opportunities to construct new gas pipelines to transport natural gas from areas of strong production to areas of strong natural gas demand. Over the next several years, NEP expects electricity generators to continue to demand higher volumes of natural gas due to prices being near historic lows and the emergence of GHG emissions standards. NEP expects these factors to continue to support a growing natural gas transportation industry.
Policy Incentives
Policy incentives in the U.S. and Canada have the effect of making the development of renewable energy projects more competitive by providing credits for a portion of the development costs or by providing favorable contract prices. A loss of or reduction in such incentives could decrease the attractiveness of renewable energy projects to developers, including NEE, which could reduce NEP's future acquisition opportunities. Such a loss or reduction could also reduce NEP's willingness to pursue or develop certain renewable energy projects due to higher operating costs or decreased revenues under its PPAs.
U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various incentives to support the development of renewable energy projects. These incentives include accelerated tax depreciation, PTCs, ITCs, cash grants, tax abatements and RPS programs. Wind and solar projects qualify as 5-year property that is eligible to be depreciated under the U.S. federal Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS). Pursuant to MACRS, wind and solar projects are fully depreciated for tax purposes over a five-year period even though the useful life of such projects is generally much longer than five years. 
Owners of utility-scale wind facilities are eligible to claim an income tax credit (the PTC, or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) upon initially achieving commercial operation. The PTC is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the wind facility during the first ten years of commercial operation. This incentive was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and has been extended several times. Alternatively, an ITC equal to 30% of the cost of a wind facility may be claimed in lieu of the PTC. In December 2015, the PTC (and ITC in lieu of the PTC) for wind facilities was extended for five years, subject to the phase-down schedule in the table 
8

below. In order to qualify for the PTC (or ITC in lieu of the PTC), construction of a wind facility must begin before a specified date. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) previously issued guidance setting forth two alternatives pursuant to which a taxpayer may begin construction on a wind facility and providing that the taxpayer must maintain a continuous program of construction or continuous efforts to advance the project to completion. In May 2016, the IRS issued additional guidance relating to the December 2015 extension and phase-down of the PTC and ITC for wind facilities. In general, this guidance modifies and extends the safe harbor for the continuous efforts and continuous construction requirements to four years compared to two years under the previous guidance. The safe harbor will generally be satisfied if the facility is placed in service no more than four calendar years after the calendar year in which construction of the facility began. The IRS also confirmed that retrofitted wind facilities may re-qualify for PTCs or ITCs pursuant to the 5% safe harbor for the begin construction requirement, as long as the cost basis of the new investment is at least 80% of the facility’s total fair value. 
Owners of solar projects are eligible to claim a 30% ITC for new solar projects, or can elect to receive an equivalent cash payment from the U.S. Department of Treasury for the value of the 30% ITC for qualifying solar projects where construction began before the end of 2011 and the projects are placed in service before 2017. In December 2015, the 30% ITC for new solar projects was extended, subject to the following phase-down schedule.

 | Year construction of project begins
 | 2015 | | 2016 | | 2017 | 2018 | | 2019 | | 2020 | 2021 | | 2022
PTC(a) | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 80 | % | | 60 | % | 40 | % | | - | | - | | - | 
Wind ITC | 30 | % | | 30 | % | 24 | % | | 18 | % | 12 | % | | - | | - | | - | 
Solar ITC(b) | 30 | % | | 30 | % | 30 | % | | 30 | % | 30 | % | | 26 | % | 22 | % | 10 | %

______________________

(a) | Percentage of the full PTC available for wind projects that begin construction during the applicable year.


(b) | ITC is limited to 10% for projects not placed in service before January 1, 2024.

RPS, currently in place in certain states and territories, require electricity providers in the state or territory to meet a certain percentage of their retail sales with energy from renewable sources. Additionally, other states in the U.S. have set renewable energy goals to reduce GHG emissions from historic levels. NEP believes that these standards and goals will create incremental demand for renewable energy in the future. See Environmental Matters - Regulation of GHG Emissions below for a further discussion.
Government incentives at the provincial level continue to drive the growth of renewable energy in Canada. Provincial governments have been supportive of renewable energy in general, and wind energy in particular, through renewable energy targets and incentive plans.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
NEP's primary business objective is to invest in contracted clean energy projects that allow it to increase its cash distributions to the holders of its common units over time. To achieve this objective, NEP intends to execute the following business strategy:

• | Focus on contracted clean energy projects. NEP intends to focus on long-term contracted clean energy projects with newer and more reliable technology, lower operating costs and relatively stable cash flows, subject to seasonal variances, consistent with the characteristics of its portfolio.


• | Focus on the U.S. and Canada. NEP intends to focus its investments in the U.S. and Canada, where it believes industry trends present significant opportunities to acquire contracted clean energy projects in diverse regions and favorable locations. By focusing on the U.S. and Canada, NEP believes it will be able to take advantage of NEE’s long-standing industry relationships, knowledge and experience.


• | Maintain a sound capital structure and financial flexibility. NEP and its subsidiaries have various financing structures in place including limited recourse project-level financings, financings through the sale of differential membership interests, term loans and revolving credit facilities. NEP believes its cash flow profile, the long-term nature of its contracts and its ability to raise capital provide flexibility for optimizing its capital structure and increasing distributions. NEP intends to continually evaluate opportunities to finance future acquisitions or refinance its existing debt and seeks to limit recourse, optimize leverage, hedge exposure, extend maturities and increase cash distributions to unitholders over the long term.


• | Take advantage of NEER’s operational excellence to maintain the value of the projects in its portfolio. NEER provides O&M, administrative and management services to NEP's projects pursuant to the MSA and other agreements. Through these agreements, NEP benefits from the operational expertise that NEER currently provides across its entire portfolio. NEP expects that these services will maximize the operational efficiencies of its portfolio.


• | Grow NEP's business and cash distributions through selective acquisitions of operating projects or projects under construction. NEP believes the ROFO agreement and its relationship with NEE provide it with opportunities for growth through the acquisition of projects that have similar characteristics to the renewable energy projects in its portfolio. NEER has granted NEP OpCo a right of first offer on any proposed sale of the NEER ROFO projects through mid-2020. NEP intends to focus on acquiring projects in operation, maintaining a disciplined investment approach and taking advantage of opportunities to acquire additional projects from NEER and third parties in the future, which it believes will allow it to increase cash distributions to its unitholders over the long term. NEER is not required, however, to offer NEP OpCo the opportunity to purchase any of its projects, including the NEER ROFO projects.

COMPETITION
Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive, commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants. While NEP's renewable energy projects are currently fully contracted, NEP may compete in the future primarily on the basis of price, but also believes the green attributes of NEP's renewable energy generation assets and relationship with NEE, among other advantages discussed below, are competitive advantages. Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is highly fragmented relative to many other commodity industries and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies NEP competes with depending on the market. In wholesale markets, customers' needs are met through a variety of means, including long-term bilateral contracts, standardized bilateral products such as full requirements service and customized supply and risk management services. 
In addition, NEP competes with other companies to acquire well-developed projects with projected stable cash flows. NEP believes its primary competitors for opportunities in North America are regulated utilities, developers, IPPs, pension funds and private equity funds.
NEP's pipeline projects face competition with respect to retaining and obtaining firm transportation contracts and compete with other pipeline companies based on location, capacity, price and reliability. The market for supply of natural gas is highly competitive, and new pipelines, storage facilities, treating facilities and facilities for related services are currently being built to serve the growing demand for natural gas.
NEP believes that it is well-positioned to execute its strategy and increase cash distributions to its unitholders over the long term based on the following competitive strengths:
Relationship with NEE. NEP believes that its relationship with NEE provides it with the following significant benefits:

• | NEE Management and Operational Expertise. NEP believes it benefits from NEE’s experience, operational excellence, cost-efficient operations and reliability. Through the MSA and other agreements with NEE, NEP's projects will receive the same benefits and expertise that NEE currently provides across its entire portfolio.


• | NEE Project Development Track Record and Pipeline. NEP believes that NEE’s long history of developing, owning and operating renewable energy projects provides NEP with a competitive advantage in North America.

Contracted projects with stable cash flows. The contracted nature of NEP's portfolio supports expected stable long-term cash flows. NEP's portfolio is composed of renewable energy projects with approximately 2,926 MW of capacity and pipeline projects with approximately 3 Bcf per day of capacity under firm transportation contracts. The renewable energy projects are fully contracted under long-term contracts that generally provide for fixed price payments subject to annual escalation over the contract term. Revenues from the pipeline projects are primarily generated from firm transportation contracts based on the fixed amount of capacity reserved by the counterparties. The renewable energy projects and pipeline projects have a total weighted average remaining contract term, based on forecasted contributions to earnings, of approximately 18 years as of December 31, 2016. 
New, well-maintained portfolio. NEP's portfolio includes renewable energy projects that have on average, based on contributions to earnings, been operating for fewer than five years. Additionally, approximately 85% of NEP's pipeline projects (on a capacity-weighted basis) have been operating for fewer than five years. Because NEP's renewable energy portfolio is relatively new and uses what NEP believes is industry-leading technology, NEP believes that it will achieve the expected levels of availability and performance without incurring unexpected operating and maintenance costs.
Geographic and resource diversification. NEP's portfolio is geographically diverse across the U.S. and Canada. In addition, NEP's portfolio includes both wind and solar electric generating facilities, as well as natural gas pipeline operations. A diverse portfolio tends to reduce the magnitude of individual project or regional deviations from historical resource conditions, providing a more stable stream of cash flows over the long term than a non-diversified portfolio. In addition, NEP believes the geographic diversity of the portfolio helps minimize the impact of adverse regulatory conditions in any one jurisdiction.
Competitiveness of renewable energy. Renewable energy technology has improved and installation costs have declined meaningfully in recent years. Wind technology has improved as a result of taller towers, longer blades and more efficient energy conversion equipment, which allow wind projects to more efficiently capture wind resource and produce more energy. Solar technology is also improving as solar cell efficiencies improve and installation costs decline.

REGULATION
NEP's operations are subject to regulation by a number of U.S. federal, state and other organizations, including, but not limited to, the following:

• | the FERC, which oversees the acquisition and disposition of generation, transmission and other facilities, transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce and wholesale purchases and sales of electric energy, among other things;


• | the NERC, which, through its regional entities, establishes and enforces mandatory reliability standards, subject to approval by the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system and to prevent major system blackouts;


• | the EPA, which has the responsibility to maintain and enforce national standards under a variety of environmental laws. The EPA also works with industries and all levels of government, including federal and state governments, in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts;


• | various agencies in Texas, which oversee safety, environmental and certain aspects of rates and transportation related to the pipeline projects; and


• | the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration and Texas Railroad Commission's Pipeline Safety Division, which, among other things, oversee the safety of natural gas pipelines.

NEP and its affiliates are also subject to federal and provincial or regional regulations in Canada related to energy operations, energy markets and environmental standards. In Canada, activities related to owning and operating wind and solar projects and participating in wholesale and retail energy markets are regulated at the provincial level. In Ontario, for example, electricity generation facilities must be licensed by the Ontario Energy Board and may also be required to complete registrations and maintain market participant status with the IESO, in which case they must agree to be bound by and comply with the provisions of the market rules for the Ontario electricity market as well as the mandatory reliability standards of the NERC.
NEP is subject to environmental laws and regulations, and is affected by the issues described in the Environmental Matters section below.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
NEP's operations are required to comply with various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. These existing and future laws and regulations may impact existing and new projects and may require NEP to obtain and maintain permits and approvals, comply with all environmental laws and regulations applicable within each jurisdiction and implement environmental, health and safety programs and procedures to monitor and control risks associated with the construction, operation and decommissioning of regulated or permitted energy assets, all of which involve a significant investment of time and resources. The following is a discussion of certain existing initiatives and rules, some of which could potentially have a material effect (either positive or negative) on NEP and its subsidiaries.
Avian/Bat Regulations and Wind Turbine Siting Guidelines. NEP is subject to numerous environmental regulations and guidelines related to threatened and endangered species and their habitats, as well as avian and bat species, for the ongoing operations of its facilities. The environmental laws in the U.S., including, among others, the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and similar environmental laws in Canada (the Species at Risk Act, the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the Endangered Species Act of 2007) provide for the protection of migratory birds, eagles and bats and endangered species of birds and bats and their habitats. Regulations have been adopted under some of these laws that contain provisions that allow the owner/operator of a facility to apply for a permit to undertake specific activities, including those associated with certain siting decisions, construction activities and operations. In addition to regulations, voluntary wind turbine siting guidelines established by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service set forth siting, monitoring and coordination protocols that are designed to support wind development in the U.S. while also protecting both birds and bats and their habitats. These guidelines include provisions for specific monitoring and study conditions which need to be met in order for projects to be in adherence with these voluntary guidelines. Complying with these environmental regulations and adhering to the provisions set forth in the voluntary wind turbine siting guidelines could result in additional costs or reduced revenues at existing and new wind and solar facilities and transmission and distribution facilities at NEP and, in the case of environmental regulations, failure to comply could result in fines and penalties.
Regulation of GHG Emissions. The U.S. Congress and certain states and regions, as well as the Government of Canada and its provinces, have taken and continue to take certain actions, such as proposing and finalizing regulation or setting targets and goals, regarding the reduction of GHG emissions and the increase of renewable energy generation. In 2015, the EPA's final rule under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (Clean Power Plan) to reduce carbon emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generation units became effective. Numerous parties challenged the Clean Power Plan and, in February 2016,  the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order staying implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending resolution of legal challenges to the rule. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard oral arguments in September 2016 and a decision is pending. The timing and ultimate outcome of the Clean Power Plan are uncertain at this time. Other GHG reduction initiatives including, among others, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the California Greenhouse Gas Regulation, aim to reduce emissions through a variety of programs currently in place and periodically undergo review and revision.
