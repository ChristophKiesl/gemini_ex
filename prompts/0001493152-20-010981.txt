Organizational History
 
GSRX Industries Inc. was incorporated in Nevada under the name “Cyberspace Vita, Inc.” on November 7, 2006. The Company’s original business plan was to create and conduct an online business for the sale of vitamins and supplements; however, Cyberspace never generated any meaningful revenues. On May 5, 2008, Cyberspace discontinued its prior business and changed its business plan.
 
Following discontinuation of its initial business plan, the Company’s business plan was to seek, investigate, and, if warranted, acquire one or more properties or businesses, and to pursue other related activities intended to enhance stockholder value. The acquisition of a business opportunity may be made by purchase, merger, exchange of stock, or otherwise, and may encompass assets or a business entity, such as a corporation, joint venture, or partnership.
 
On May 11, 2017, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with Project 1493, and the sole member of 1493, pursuant to which the member transferred all of the outstanding membership interests of 1493 to the Company in exchange for 16,690,912 of its restricted shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 3,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share.
 
As a result of the Exchange Agreement, 1493 became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the business of 1493 became the business of the Company. The Company, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, is in the business of acquiring, developing and operating medical cannabis dispensaries in Puerto Rico.
 
On May 12, 2017, the Company changed its name from “Cyberspace Vita, Inc.” to “Green Spirit Industries Inc.” On June 22, 2018, the Company changed its name from “Green Spirit Industries Inc.” to “GSRX Industries Inc.”
 
On March 30, 2019 the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Agreement”) and an Ancillary Rights Agreement (the “Ancillary Agreement”) with Chemesis International Inc., a British Columbian Corporation (“CADMF”). In the Share Agreement, the Company received 7,291,874 restricted shares of common stock of CADMF.
 
Effective August 28, 2019, eight shareholders of the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with CADMF, pursuant to which the shareholders exchanged 42,534,454 common shares and 1,000 shares of preferred stock of the Company for 14,880,705 shares of CADMF. As a result and as of the date hereof, Chemesis owns 54,151,035 common shares or 66.20% of the Company.
 
On May 7, 2020 the Company entered into an option agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with a royalty right with Natural Ventures PR, LLC (“NVPR”), 80% owned NVPR to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interest of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Project 1493, LLC (the “1493 Membership Interest”). Project 1493, LLC holds all of operating and issued Puerto Rican dispensaries and cannabis licenses.
 
The right of NVPR to exercise the option and acquire the 1493 Membership Interest is conditional upon NVPR performing, or causing to be performed by its parent company Chemesis, the following milestones (the “Milestones”) within the applicable timelines set forth below:
 

(a) | paying $25,000 to the Company (the “Initial Cash Payment”), and (ii) waiving the 36-month leak-out in respect of the 729,187 common shares of Chemesis currently held by the Company, which Milestones were completed concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Option Agreement (such date, the “Effective Date”); 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | issuing to GSRX 5,190,000 common shares in the capital of Chemesis (the “Chemesis Shares”) within 10 months after the Effective Date. The Chemesis Shares will be subject to a 36-month leak-out schedule; and 
(c) | paying an additional $2,475,000 to GSRX within 15 months after the Effective Date. 

 
Immediately upon NVPR completing, or causing Chemesis to complete, as the case may be, each of the aforementioned Milestones within the respective timelines set out above, NVPR will be deemed to have acquired all of the 1493 Membership Interest (“Exercise of the Option”).
 
Upon Exercise of the Option, NVPR and the Company shall enter into a royalty agreement (the “Royalty Agreement”), the form of which was negotiated concurrent with the Option Agreement, pursuant to which NVPR shall grant to the Company a revenues interest royalty and the right to receive payments in respect thereof equal to five percent (5%) of the revenues realized by NVPR from the operations of Project 1493, LLC in Puerto Rico for a period of five years.
 
Prior to the Exercise of the Option, either NVPR or the Company may terminate the Option Agreement upon delivering notice to the other of its intention to terminate. If GSRX elects to terminate, then NVPR will not acquire the 1493 Membership Interest and the Company must, as a condition precedent to such election: (i) return all cash payments it received under the terms of the Option Agreement; (ii) return the Chemesis Shares (if any) it received under the terms of the Option Agreement; and (iii) pay to Chemesis a break fee of US$100,000. If NVPR elects to terminate, then NVPR will not acquire the 1493 Membership Interest and GSRX will be entitled to keep the Initial Cash Payment. Subject to termination of the Option Agreement as described above, the term of the Option is 15 months after the Effective Date.
 
In conjunction with the Option Agreement, on May 7, 2020, the Company entered into a security, pledge and assignment agreement (the “Security Agreement”) with NVPR which assigns and pledges to NVPR a security interest in all of the Company’s right, title and interest in and to 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interest of Project 1493, LLC.

California Operations
 
The Green Room
 
On March 7, 2018, Mendocino entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with a third-party seller, pursuant to which Mendocino acquired all of the assets relating to a retail cannabis business in Point Arena, Mendocino County, California for total cash consideration of $350,000.

As of the date hereof, the retail dispensary was available for adult use sales in addition to medical cannabis. Featuring more than 15 strains grown locally and products only found in this location, many customers have made The Green Room a destination place. Coupled with our current plans in establishing new cultivation and manufacturing operations through our other subsidiaries, we intend to increase product offerings by producing unique product lines and branded items solely for purchase at The Green Room. We believe that this will result in return-customers.
 
We also assumed the prior owner’s delivery license, which allows delivery of The Green Room product through telephone or on-line orders to any county in California that allows such product delivery. The delivery car is allowed to carry $3,000 of product at retail price, but may make as many daily deliveries as necessary. Once the product is delivered, the driver must reload to continue deliveries. The car contains GPS and a built in safe for security, and the sales proceeds are returned to the store’s safe after each delivery to avoid having cash in the car.
 
Spirulinex
 
On March 3, 2018, we entered into an operating agreement with Solunas Aqua Corp., a California corporation (“Solunas”), relating to the formation of Spirulinex, LLC, a California limited liability company. Spirulinex was formed as a limited liability company between GSRX and Solunas (the “Spirulinex”) for the purpose of carrying out the manufacturing of cannabis and cannabinoid products for distribution in the State of California. As of the date of this report, Spirulinex had not received the requisite license to operate.
 
On April 13, 2018, Spirulinex entered into a lease agreement for a 4,500 square foot facility located in San Francisco, California (the “Spirulinex Facility”). The Company abandoned the lease, and was assumed by the minority partner.
 
As of March 7, 2019, the Company terminated funding the operations of Spirulinex. As of the date of this report, the Company is in process of dissolving the LLC.

As of April 16, 2019, the Company terminated funding the operations of Sunset. As of the date of this report, the Company is in process of dissolving the LLC.

CBD Operation
 
Pure and Natural LLC
 
On October 8, 2018, the Company formed Pure and Natural LLC (“PaN”) as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for the purpose of selling its CBD products on line through its website “getpureandnatural.com.”
 
PaN has entered into four strategic agreements to assist in promoting and bringing brand awareness to the Pure and Natural name. PaN has entered into the following agreements: (i) on February 20, 2019 PaN and BYB Extreme Fighting Series, LLC (“BYB”) entered into a sponsorship agreement (“Agreement”) to sponsor three events of the BYB EXTREME Series. PaN will be the “Title Sponsor” and the events will be promoted as the exclusive sponsor for “BYB Brawl For It All Presented by GetPureAndNatural.com”, which includes having “GetPureAndNatural.com” on events and broadcasts, the triangle cage and mat, ring cards, advertisements, BYB website, social media posts and will be the official CBD Products of DADA 5000 and BYB Fighting Series; (ii) on March 5, 2019 PaN and JCD3 Enterprises, Inc.

Business Model 
 
Medical Cannabis Products:
 
We operate as a service business specializing in the sale of medical cannabis, edibles and paraphernalia, including, oils, lotions, THC pills, vaporizers, rigs, grinders, t-shirts, hats, logo items, and bongs and pipes with vaporizer attachments through our strategically located licensed dispensaries.
 
In Puerto Rico, we had entered into a long-term supply agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) to purchase our products from one of the largest growers on the island who operates a state-of-the art facility, currently has multiple strands of cannabis flower available and is able to produce up to 200 pounds a month. Pursuant to the terms of the Supply Agreement, the supplier agreed to sell products to us, upon the issuance by the Department of Health of Puerto Rico of the requisite operating permit for each of the dispensaries, at up to a 20% discount to current wholesale market prices.
 
In California, we are currently operating one (1) dispensary in Point Arena. On March 6, 2019 we signed a lease to operate a dispensary in Palm Springs, which is in the planning and permit phase; we received local permits for a manufacturing facility and distribution business (from growers and manufacturers to retailers) in Point Arena and currently in the planning and state permit phases of such businesses. Mendocino also holds a delivery license, which enables the dispensary to pick up and deliver products in any county in California which allows a delivery service. Similar to platforms such as “Uber Eats” or “Grub Hub”, a customer may place an order by telephone or the internet, and a driver will deliver the requested product to the customer’s doorstep. The driver may carry a maximum of $3,000 of product (retail value).
 
1493 holds five licenses and (3) pre-qualified locations in Puerto Rico, three of which are in various phases of development and construction. Currently, we have one (1) dispensary in operation in California and five (5) in Puerto Rico.
 
Our current fixed overhead, which includes our ongoing leasing obligations, is approximately $85,000 per month. We anticipate that fixed overhead will increase at such time as more dispensaries begin operations. In addition, we expect that our fixed costs will continue to increase so long as we are successful in our plan of expansion. We anticipate supporting our operations through the anticipated revenue once the dispensaries and other operations become fully operational and, if necessary, through the sale of our securities in order to complete the development of our dispensaries. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising sufficient revenues necessary to support our operations, or that we will be successful in selling our securities.

We anticipate earning revenue by selling medical cannabis, edibles, pills, creams, patches and oral drops, and paraphernalia such as vaporizers. The average net profit for medical marijuana dispensaries is 20% in the U.S., according to a study conducted by Marijuana Business Daily and the median annual revenue is $1,200,000.
 
In addition, we will focus on providing the best and most friendly customer service, and provide the highest quality brands and widest variety possible in order to attract repeat business.
 
CBD Products:
 
The Company’s CBD products are made from “hemp,” which is defined as “the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.”
 
The Company intends to produce and distribute its CBD products in various delivery forms including gels, tinctures, balms, pain creams, face masks, vape pens and energy packs. The Company’s CBD operations will be completed through Pure and Natural, LLC (“PaN”) via wholesale and online sales via its website “getpureandnatural.com.”
 
On December 17, 2018, PaN entered into an operating lease for a 1,725 square foot CBD retail store at 3100 RR 620 South, Suite 200, Lakeway, Texas for eighty six (86) months beginning May 18, 2019 and ending July 18, 2026. The lease has one five-year option.
 
On December 19, 2018, Pure and Natural, LLC entered into an operating lease for a kiosk in Governor’s Square Mall, in Clarksville, Tennessee for fifteen (15) months beginning February 1, 2019 and ending April 30, 2020. Currently, the kiosk is on a month to month lease. We began operations at the kiosk on February 9, 2019.
 
On February 8, 2018, PaN entered into an operating lease for a 2,525 square foot CBD retail store at 2306 West End Avenue, Nashville, Tennessee for five (5) years beginning February 1, 2019 and ending January 31, 2024. The lease has one five-year option.
 
Revenue Streams:
 
We anticipate that revenues will be generated from the following:
 

● | Cannabis; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Derivatives (oils, lotions, edibles, THC pills); 
● | Paraphernalia (vaporizers, grinders, rigs, bongs and pipes with vaporizer attachments); 
● | Clothing (hats, t-shirts, logos); and 
● | CBD Products (softgels, tinctures, balms, vape pens and cartridges, face masks, pain creams, pet treats); 

 
We expect to realize, although no assurance can be given, approximately 42-58% gross margins on THC edibles, approximately 40-45% gross margins on CBD edibles, 40-51% gross margins on cannabis flower and paraphernalia and a range of approximately 20% to 60% net margins on CBD products depending on the particular product sold and the distribution method in which it is sold.

Cost Structure:
 
We price our cannabis and CBD products at competitive market rates.
 
Marketing
 
Our marketing and sales strategy will be aimed at generating long-term, repeat customers, as well as attracting tourists who visit the dispensaries who wish to purchase cannabis and cannabis products. In order to generate repeat customers, we intend to provide the highest quality medical cannabis, at the lowest possible cost to ensure we build a loyal customer base. Further, we have built what we believe are aesthetically pleasing dispensaries and have hired and trained all of our employees to provide excellent customer service.
 
We intend to leverage the Internet and social media platforms, including, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google+, LinkedIn, the Yellow Pages online, texts (currently we send 175,000 texts per month), Weedmaps and over 50 cannabis websites we have identified. Our marketing will focus on the wide variety of our cannabis products and their high quality.
 
We also intend to utilize blogs, micro-ads, testimonial interviews, articles and deploy this media across all social media channels and websites accessed by our customer targets.
 
The Cannabis Industry
 
Market Opportunity
 
The legal cannabis markets in the United States are expanding rapidly. As of the date of this filing, thirty-three (33) states, Washington D.C. and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico have legalized the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Additionally, ten (10) states, Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Washington D.C. have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use.
 
We believe the cannabis market will continue to rapidly expand as existing states broaden the definition of the approved uses for cannabis (i.e. from medicinal to recreational use) and additional states legalize cannabis for at least some other purposes. Despite the fact that the Federal Controlled Substances Act makes the use and possession of marijuana illegal on a national level, recent guidance from the previous administration under President Obama suggested that it will continue to tolerate legalization at the state level, especially when backed by strong and effective regulation. On August 29, 2013, United States Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued the “Cole Memo” to United States Attorneys guiding them to prioritize enforcement of Federal law away from the cannabis industry operating as permitted under state law, so long as certain requirements are met. On December 11, 2014, the DOJ issued another memorandum about its position and enforcement protocol with regard to Indian Country, stating that the Eight Priorities in the Cole Memo would guide the United States Attorneys’ cannabis enforcement efforts in Indian Country. On December 16, 2014, as a component of the federal spending bill, the Obama administration enacted regulations that prohibit the DOJ from using funds to prosecute state-based legal medical cannabis programs. We believe it is significant that in 2016, the Congressional Spending Bill specifically prevented the Justice Department from spending money to enforce the federal ban on growing or selling cannabis in states where cannabis has been approved.
 
More recently under the Trump administration, on January 4, 2019, the DOJ suspended the Cole Memo and replaced it with a new Memorandum titled with the subject “Marijuana Enforcement” from then Attorney General Jeff Sessions (the “Sessions Memo”) which provides that each U.S. Attorney has the discretion to determine which types of cannabis-related cases should be federally prosecuted, thus ending the broad safe harbor provided under the Cole Memo.
 

10
--


We continue to follow and monitor the actions and statements of the Trump administration, the DOJ and Congress’ positions on federal law and cannabis policy. As the possession and use of cannabis is illegal under the CSA, we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities through the equipment we intend to sell in the U.S. and directly violating federal law by producing Cannabis under State law. Under federal law, and more specifically the CSA, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis is illegal. Our equipment could be used by persons or entities engaged in the business of possession, use, cultivation, and/or transfer of cannabis.
 
As a result, law enforcement authorities, in their attempt to regulate the illegal use of cannabis, could seek to bring an action or actions against us, including, but not limited to, a claim of aiding and abetting another’s criminal activities or directly violating the CSA. The federal aiding and abetting statute provides that anyone who “commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal” (18 U.S.C. §2(a).) Enforcement of federal law regarding cannabis would likely result in the Company being unable to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.
 
Target Markets
 
We believe that not since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, has a consumer product business opportunity of this magnitude been created simply by changes in the law. According to an IBISWorld report, the cannabis industry is expected to achieve rapid growth over the next five years. We believe the industry will continue to benefit from increasingly favorable attitudes towards medical cannabis-based treatments and applications as acceptance and legitimacy of cannabis continues to grow.
 
Our target markets are those where states or U.S. territories have legalized the production and use of cannabis, such as Puerto Rico and California, and to add new markets in states that have recently legalized cannabis use.
 
Most recently, Vermont legislatively legalized and voters in Michigan approved a ballot to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use, bringing the total number of states with legalized recreational cannabis use to ten, in addition to the District of Columbia.
 
As of the date of this filing, thirty-three (33) states, Washington D.C. and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico have legalized the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Additionally, ten (10) states, Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Washington D.C. have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use. While it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it would take for a state to establish regulations relating to the sale of cannabis, or for those businesses engaged in this activity to begin generating revenue from operations, we anticipate, but no assurance can be given, that for new states legalizing the medical use of cannabis, revenues will begin to be realized beginning in 2019.
 
Continued development of the regulated cannabis industry depends on continued legislative authorization at the state level. Progress, while encouraging, is not assured and any number of factors could slow or halt progress in the cannabis industry.
 
Puerto Rico – Market Opportunity
 
Puerto Rico benefits from a large and growing tourism industry. Puerto Rico was recently chosen by The New York Times as its number one place to visit in 2019. Importantly, patients who hold a license to buy medical marijuana in the 33 states where it is now legal may use their patient license to purchase marijuana at Puerto Rico’s dispensaries.

The Academic Sciences of Puerto Rico (ASPR), in collaboration with the Cannabis Doctors of Puerto Rico, conducted a certification program for doctors to obtain the Health Department (HD) license and recommended medicinal cannabis to nearly 200,000 patients. Accordingly, and considering that Puerto Rico is an island with a population of 3.5 million, the Company believes that there is a potential market of 200,000 patients, or 6% of Puerto Rico’s current population. In addition, there is a potentially very large market opportunity presented by the burgeoning tourist industry. If only 2% of the tourists visiting Puerto Rico purchase medical marijuana, that would add another 200,000 patients on an annual basis or an average of approximately 18,000 patients per month.
 
We believe our initial locations present significant revenue potential and growth opportunity. We have strategically picked our initial locations based on the following factors: population density, disposable income, and proximity to commercial and districts tourist destinations.
 
California – Market Opportunity
 
California is the most populous state in the United States with a population of 39.3 million residents. California’s $2.67 trillion economy is larger than any other state. If it were a country, it would be the fifth largest economy in the world. In 2016, Proposition 64 was passed allowing the use of medicinal cannabis, and effective January 1, 2019, it became legal for adult recreational use. Proposition 64 legalized commercial cultivation and sale of cannabis in California for medical use as of the date of passage. All cannabis activity is exclusively controlled through registration and permitting by local governments, and then the State issues the final operating license.
 
According to visitcalifornia.com, in 2018, California’s tourism experienced an eighth straight year of growth, setting a new record for visitor spending at $132.4 billion. According to BDS Analytics, 2019 sales of cannabis products in California were approximately $2.5 billion, making California the leading state in cannabis sales.
 
Medical Cannabis Market
 
The last five years have seen a dramatic shift in public opinion on medical marijuana, which is reflected in the direction of individual states toward legalization. A Quinnipiac University Poll published on March 6, 2019 showed 93% of registered voters in the United States support the use of medically prescribed cannabis. Thirty-three states and Washington, D.C., have enacted medical cannabis laws. According to marijuanapolicyproject.com, as of December 3, 2019, there are approximately 2.6 million registered medical marijuana patients within these states. The five states with the largest known current medical marijuana patient populations are: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Michigan and New York.
 
Cannabis is used for medicinal purposes and has proven to be an effective treatment for pain relief, inflammation and a number of other medical disorders. According to an IBISWorld report, new medical research and changing public opinion have boosted industry growth.
 
Doctors may prescribe ‘legalized’ medical cannabis in approved states where patients can receive a “recommendation” from a state-approved and licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions specified by the state. Medical cannabis is being used to treat severe or chronic pain, inflammation, nausea and vomiting, neurologic symptoms (including muscle spasticity), glaucoma, cancer, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, anorexia, arthritis, Alzheimer’s, Crohn’s disease, fibromyalgia, ADD, ADHD, Tourette’s syndrome, spinal cord injury and numerous other conditions. Cannabis oil has also been proven effective in treating epileptic seizures in children.
 
Recreational Cannabis Market
 
Ten states have legalized recreational cannabis – Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, plus Washington, D.C. In November 2012, Colorado voters legalized recreational marijuana use. This history-changing legislation created a window of opportunity for the commercialization and state taxation of a plant group that has, until recently, been virtually untouchable and set the wheels in motion for other states to follow. In July of 2014, Washington State launched its recreational program, while Oregon and Alaska and the District of Columbia voted to introduce recreational programs commencing in 2015. In November 2016, California, Maine, Massachusetts, and Nevada all passed ballot initiatives for the legalization of recreational cannabis. In January 2019, Vermont passed a bill legalizing recreational marijuana use, becoming the first state to legalize marijuana legislatively. In November 2019, Michigan passed a ballot initiative for the legalization of recreational cannabis, which took effect in December 2019. A Quinnipiac University Poll published on March 6, 2019 showed that 60% of registered voters in the United States support the legalization of marijuana.

Competition
 
We face significant competition in all aspects of our business. Specifically, we face competition from a number of companies that operate dispensaries, growing facilities and extraction facilities in the legal cannabis market within the United States and U.S. territories.
 
While such competition exists within the industry as a whole, there is limited competition in Puerto Rico. Currently, there are fifty-four dispensaries with approved licenses in Puerto Rico.
 
We also anticipate additional competition from the unauthorized sale and purchase of cannabis through the “black market” in Puerto Rico and California. Black market competition in Puerto Rico is estimated by the government at $200 million annually. While we deem the “black market” to be a major competitor, we believe, although no assurance can be given, that we can increase our market share by offering a greater variety of product at competitive prices and reduce risks for consumers.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that consumers generally choose their dispensary based on several factors, including proximity to where they live and work, price, quality, variety and the overall service experience. We believe that our advantage stems from our relationships with our supplier. Our supplier, who operates a state-of-the art facility, has over 36 strands available and can produce up to 200 pounds a month. Our supplier, the largest in Puerto Rico in total production capacity, has agreed to sell products to us at reduced prices which we believe will allow us to achieve 75% gross margins, all while maintaining a major price advantage over competitors.
 
We also believe that we possess certain other competitive strengths and advantages in the industries in which we intend to operate:
 
Range of Services. We intend to leverage our breadth of services and resources to deliver comprehensive, integrated solutions to companies in the cannabis industry—from operational, compliance and marketing consulting to products, security and financing services.
 
Strategic Alliances. We are dedicated to growing our business through strategic acquisitions, partnerships and agreements that will enable us to enter and expand into new markets. Our strategy is to pursue alliances with potential targets that have the ability to generate positive cash flow, effectively meet customer needs and supply desirable products, services or technologies, among other considerations. We anticipate that strategic alliances will play a significant role as more states pass legislation permitting the cultivation and sale of hemp and cannabis.
 
Regulatory Compliance. The state laws regulating the cannabis industry are changing at a rapid pace. Currently, there are 33 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico that have created a legislative body to manage the medical cannabis industry. Ten of those states also allow recreational use. We intend to take such steps necessary to ensure that all aspects of our operations are in compliance with all laws, policies, guidance and regulations to which we are subject and providing an opportunity to our customers and allies to use our services in order to ensure that they, too, are in full compliance are both critical components of our business plan.

Industry Knowledge. We continue to create, share and leverage information and experiences with the purpose of creating awareness and identifying opportunities to increase stockholder value. Our management team has business expertise, extensive knowledge of the cannabis industry and closely monitors changes in legislation. We intend to work with partners who will enhance the breadth of our industry knowledge.
 
Lending Capabilities. In February 2014, the Treasury Department issued guidelines for financial institutions dealing with cannabis-related businesses. Nevertheless, many banks and traditional financial institutions refuse to provide financial services to cannabis-related businesses. We plan to provide finance and leasing solutions to market participants using the FinCEN guidelines as a primary guide for compliance with federal law.
 
Government and Industry Regulation
 
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA in states or territories that allow cannabis use recreationally and medicinally, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
Notwithstanding the CSA, as of the date of this filing, 33 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico allow their residents to use medical cannabis. Voters in the states of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington have approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use. Such state and territorial laws are in conflict with the federal CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal at the federal level.
 
In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. For example, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration, James M. Cole, issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. The Cole Memo ultimately emphasizes the need for robust state regulation of marijuana. The memorandum “rests on its expectation that state and local governments that have enacted laws authorizing marijuana-related conduct will implement strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems that will address the threat those state laws could pose to public safety, public health, and other law enforcement interests.” In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) provided guidelines (the “FinCEN Guidelines”) on February 14, 2014, regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) obligations.
 
Additional existing and pending legislation provides, or seeks to provide, protection to persons acting in violation of federal law but in compliance with state laws regarding cannabis. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, which funds the DOJ, prohibits the DOJ from using funds to prevent states with medical cannabis laws from implementing such laws. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment is effective through April 28, 2018, but as an amendment to an appropriations bill, it must be renewed annually. As of the date of this Form 10-K, it has been renewed through September 30, 2020. The Compassionate Access Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act (the “CARERS Act”) has been introduced in the U.S. Senate, which proposes to reclassify cannabis under the CSA to Schedule II, thereby changing the plant from a federally criminalized substance to one that has recognized medical uses. More recently, the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2018 has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, which proposes to exclude persons who produce, possess, distribute, dispense, administer or deliver marijuana in compliance with state laws from the regulatory controls and administrative, civil and criminal penalties of the CSA.
 

14
--


As of the date of this filing, neither the CARERS Act nor the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2018 has been enacted. However, the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment has been renewed as part of an omnibus spending bill, in effect through September 30, 2020.
 
Furthermore, on January 4, 2018, the now former U.S. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, issued the Sessions Memo, stating that the Cole Memo was rescinded effectively immediately. In particular, Mr. Sessions stated that “prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions,” which require “federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” Mr. Sessions went on to state in the memorandum that given the Justice Department’s well-established general principles, “previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately.”
 
In response to the Sessions Memo, U.S. Attorney Bob Troy for the District of Colorado issued a statement on January 4, 2018, stating that the United States Attorney’s Office in Colorado is already guided by the well-established principles referenced in the Sessions Memo, “focusing in particular on identifying and prosecuting those who create the greatest safety threats to our communities around the state. We will, consistent with the Attorney General’s latest guidance, continue to take this approach in all of our work with our law enforcement partners throughout Colorado.”
 
The current U.S. Attorney General, William Barr, has signaled that he might be taking a different approach towards interfering with state medical marijuana laws than his predecessor Jeff Sessions. Mr. Barr was confirmed as the U.S. Attorney General on February 14, 2019. During his confirmation hearing on February 15, 2019, Mr. Barr addressed the conflict between federal and state cannabis policies, stating that his approach would be “not to upset settled expectations and the reliant interests that have arisen as a result of the Cole memorandum.” Mr. Barr went even further, stating that “to the extent that people are complying with the state laws—distribution and production and so forth—[the DOJ is] not going to go after that.” Despite the possibilities of a more relaxed approach, Mr. Barr voiced his desire for clarity and uniformity on the issue and preference that the United States has a federal law that prohibits marijuana everywhere.
 
It is unclear at this time whether the Trump administration will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement. However, a significant change in the federal government’s enforcement policy with respect to current federal laws applicable to cannabis could cause significant financial damage to us. We may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government depending on the nature of such change. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we have provided products and services to state-approved cannabis cultivators and dispensary facilities, as well as operating our own dispensary, manufacturing and extraction facilities. As a result, we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting or directly engaging in illegal activities, a violation of federal law. We may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government.
 
The Cole Memo
 
Because of the discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities, DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued the Cole Memo concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. The Cole Memo guidance applies to all of the DOJ’s federal enforcement activity, including civil enforcement and criminal investigations and prosecutions, concerning cannabis in all states.

15
--


The Cole Memo reiterates Congress’s determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo notes that the DOJ is committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also notes that the DOJ is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provides guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the “Enforcement Priorities”) in preventing:
 

● | the distribution of cannabis to minors; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels; 
● | the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 
● | state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
● | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; 
● | drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use; 
● | the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and 
● | cannabis possession or use on federal property. 

 
Although the Sessions Memo has rescinded the Cole Memo and it is unclear at this time what the ultimate impact of that rescission will have on our business, if any, we intend to continue to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in and ensure that our activities do not interfere with any of the Enforcement Priorities set forth in the Cole Memo.
 
FinCEN
 
FinCEN provided guidance regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their BSA obligations. For purposes of the FinCEN guidelines, a “financial institution” includes any person doing business in one or more of the following capacities:
 

● | bank (except bank credit card systems); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | broker or dealer in securities; 
● | money services business; 
● | telegraph company; 
● | card club; and 
● | a person subject to supervision by any state or federal bank supervisory authority. 

 
In general, the decision to open, close, or refuse any particular account or relationship should be made by each financial institution based on a number of factors specific to that institution. These factors may include its particular business objectives, an evaluation of the risks associated with offering a particular product or service, and its capacity to manage those risks effectively. Thorough customer due diligence is a critical aspect of making this assessment.
 
In assessing the risk of providing services to a cannabis-related business, a financial institution should conduct customer due diligence that includes: (i) verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered; (ii) reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its cannabis-related business; (iii) requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the business and related parties; (iv) developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus recreational customers); (v) ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties; (vi) ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in this guidance; and (vii) refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk. With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available.
 

16
--


As part of its customer due diligence, a financial institution should consider whether a cannabis-related business implicates one of the Cole Memo Enforcement Priorities or violates state law. This is a particularly important factor for a financial institution to consider when assessing the risk of providing financial services to a cannabis-related business. Considering this factor also enables the financial institution to provide information in BSA reports pertinent to law enforcement’s priorities. A financial institution that decides to provide financial services to a cannabis-related business would be required to file suspicious activity reports. It is unclear at this time what impact the Sessions Memo will have on customer due diligence by a financial institution.
 
While we believe we do not qualify as a financial institution in the United States, we cannot be certain that we do not fall under the scope of the FinCEN guidelines. We plan to use the FinCEN Guidelines, as may be amended, as a basis for assessing our relationships with potential tenants, clients and customers. As such, as we engage in financing activities, we intend to adhere to the guidance of FinCEN in conducting and monitoring our financial transactions. Because this area of the law is uncertain and is expected to evolve rapidly, we believe that FinCEN’s guidelines will help us best operate in a prudent, reasonable and acceptable manner. There is no assurance, however, that our activities will not violate some aspect of the CSA. If we are found to violate the federal statute or any other in connection with our activities, our company could face serious criminal and civil sanctions.
 
Moreover, since the use of cannabis is illegal under federal law, we may have difficulty acquiring or maintaining bank accounts and insurance, and our stockholders may find it difficult to deposit their stock with brokerage firms.
 
Licensing and Local Regulations
 
Where applicable, we will apply for additional state licenses that are necessary to conduct our business in compliance with local laws. Local laws at the city, county and municipal levels add a layer of complexity to legalized cannabis. Despite a state’s adoption of legislation legalizing cannabis, cities, counties and municipalities within the state may have the ability to otherwise restrict cannabis activities, including but not limited to cultivation, retail or consumption.
 
Zoning sets forth the approved use of land in any given city, county or municipality. Zoning is set by local governments or local voter referendum, and may otherwise be restricted by state laws. For example, under certain state laws a seller of liquor may not be allowed to operate within 1,000 feet of a school. There may be similar restrictions imposed on cannabis operators, which will restrict where cannabis operations may be located and the manner and size to which they can grow and operate. Zoning can be subject to change or withdrawal, and properties can be re-zoned. The zoning of our properties will have a direct impact on our business operations.
 
Regulatory Environment
 
The regulatory status of the cannabis industry is shifting rapidly at the state level, with momentum toward a change at the federal level through pressure on the U.S. Congress and the White House. Current federal regulations classify cannabis as a Schedule 1 substance, defined as “drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” This drug classification also includes heroin, LSD and ecstasy.
 
The legal cannabis industry has evolved considerably over the past 3-5 years. We believe the industry has reached the tipping point for legalization through pressure from citizens’ groups in individual states for the legalization of medical and/or recreational marijuana. As reported by Pew Research Center in April 2015, nearly half (49%) of Americans say they have tried marijuana.
 
A Quinnipiac University Poll published on March 6, 2019 showed 93% of registered voters in the United States support the use of medically prescribed cannabis and that 60% support the legalization of marijuana use.
 
Millennials (currently 18-34) have been in the forefront of legalization support: 85% favor legalizing marijuana use, by far the highest percentage of any age group. 63% of voters ages 35-49 and 59% of voters ages 50-64 support the legalization of marijuana use. Voters over 65 years old are more divided on the topic, with 44% in support of the legalization of marijuana use.
 

17

Public support has given rise to the passage of new marijuana laws and regulations in a number of states, as well as multiple legal reforms on legislative dockets. Each state’s legal environment is unique, making it critical for businesses to know and understand the regulatory landscape on a state-by-state basis.
 
Another regulatory variable adding to the complexity of the legal cannabis market are the local laws at the municipality and county levels. Even when a state enacts legislation legalizing cannabis, each level of local government has the right to exercise restrictions on cannabis activities, such as retail, consumption, transportation and cultivation. Zoning is an area of particular concern, which is set forth at the local level. This can restrict where businesses can be located and the manner and size in which they operate. Understanding individual state’s laws and local regulations requires business operators and investors to account for multiple levels of regulatory compliance, such as how marijuana may be sourced, processed, distributed, and to whom, where and how it may be sold.
 
State Legal Status
 
While new state-level legalization efforts continue to expand the number of states involved in the cannabis industry, only a handful of existing states have any meaningful full-scale operations for the cultivation and distribution of cannabis. This presents a significant growth opportunity for investment over the next several years as the existing legalized states and new states’ markets come online.

● | Medical Cannabis Legalization - 33 states have legalized medical marijuana, plus Washington, D.C. and the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Recreational Cannabis Legalization - 10 states (AK, CA, CO, ME, MA, MI, NV, OR, VT, WA) plus Washington, D.C. have passed laws that allow for adult recreational use of marijuana 

California State Regulatory Overview: Cannabis
 
In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, also known as the Compassionate Use Act, allowing physicians to recommend cannabis for an inclusive set of qualifying medical conditions, but it did not establish a state licensing authority or comprehensive regulations to oversee cannabis collectives. In 2015, the California legislature passed three bills, collectively known as the “Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act” (“MCRSA”), which established a framework for licensing and regulating medical cannabis businesses. In 2016, California voters passed “The Adult Use of Marijuana Act” (“AUMA”), which legalized adult-use cannabis for adults 21 years and older and created a licensing system for commercial cannabis businesses. On June 27, 2017, Governor Brown signed SB-94 into law which combined elements of MCRSA and AUMA into one state licensing structure under the “Medicinal and Adult-Use of Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act” (“MAUCRSA”).
 
Pursuant to MAUCRSA: (i) CalCannabis, a division of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, issues licenses to cannabis cultivators: (ii) the Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch (the “MCSB”), a division of the California Department of Public Health, issues licenses to cannabis manufacturers; and (iii) the California Department of Consumer Affairs, via its agency the Bureau of Cannabis Control (the “BCC”), issues licenses to cannabis distributors, testing laboratories, retailers, and micro-businesses. These agencies also oversee the various aspects of implementing and maintaining California’s cannabis landscape, including the statewide track and trace system. All three agencies released their initial emergency rulemakings at the end of 2017 and updated them with minor revisions in June 2018. The three agencies adopted their permanent rulemakings on January 16, 2019, which are now in effect. All three agencies began issuing temporary licenses in January 2018 and stopped doing so on December 31, 2018, pursuant to MAUCRSA.
 
Local authorization is a prerequisite to obtaining a state license, and local governments are permitted to prohibit or otherwise regulate the types and number of cannabis businesses allowed in their locality. All three state regulatory agencies require confirmation from the applicable locality that the operator is operating in compliance with local requirements and was granted authorization to continue or commence commercial cannabis operations within the locality’s jurisdiction. Applicants are required to comply with all local zoning and land use requirements and provide written authorization from the property owner where the commercial cannabis operations are proposed to take place, which must dictate that the applicant has the property owner’s authorization to engage in the specific state-sanctioned commercial cannabis activities proposed to occur on the premises. The State has not set a limit on the number of state licenses an entity may hold, unlike other states that have restricted how many cannabis licenses an entity may hold in total or for various types of cannabis activity. Although vertical integration across multiple license types is allowed under MAUCRSA, testing laboratory licensees may not hold any other licenses aside from a laboratory license. There are also no residency requirements for ownership of a state license under MAUCRSA.
 
Unlike other states, California has not set a limit on the number of state licenses that a single entity may hold, with certain limited exceptions. Similarly, vertical integration across multiple license types is allowed under MAUCRSA, with the exception of testing laboratory licensees, which entities may not hold any other license type. The laws and regulations of the State of California related to the cultivation, manufacturing and dispensing of cannabis, including, but not limited to, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 26000 et seq., and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.
 
Puerto Rico Regulatory Overview: Cannabis
 
On December 28, 2015, the Puerto Rico Health Department issued Regulation No. 8686 to regulate medical cannabis, which was later repealed by Regulation No. 8766, and amended by Regulation No. 8847, known as the Regulation for the Use, Possession, Cultivation, Manufacture, Production, Dispensation and Research of Medical Cannabis.
 
On July 9, 2017, the MEDICINAL Act, Act No. 42-2017, was enacted to reaffirm the legal framework for the medical cannabis industry and create the Medical Cannabis Regulatory Board (the “Regulatory Board”), ascribed to the Puerto Rico Department of Health. On July 2, 2018, the Puerto Rico Health Department and the Regulatory Board issued Regulation No. 9038 which repeals all prior regulations (“Reg. No. 9038”). Therefore, the current legal framework surrounding Medical Cannabis consists of the MEDICINAL Act, Reg. No. 9038 and the administrative orders, bulletins and forms issued thereunder.
 

18
--


The MEDICINAL Act prohibits the recreational use of cannabis and only allows the use of medical cannabis by licensed patients who have obtained a recommendation from an authorized physician due to a debilitating medical condition. There are 27 debilitating medical conditions identified in Reg. No. 9038, and the Board’s Medical Advisory Council is authorized to recommend and the Board may approve additional conditions.
 
Medical cannabis may be provided to patients as oral drops, oral inhalers, suppositories, transdermal patch, edible products, concentrates, pill, topical (lotions, balms and patches) or through the vaporized delivery method (under certain exceptions). Smoking is specifically prohibited and medical cannabis products may not be used in public places.
 
The six types of licenses that medical cannabis establishments may obtain are: cultivation, dispensary, laboratory, manufacturing, research, and transportation. These licenses are valid for a one-year term. An entity may obtain multiple licenses. In order to obtain any of these licenses 51% of the ownership of the entity must come from Puerto Rico capital, as the term is defined in the Reg. No. 9038. As part of the license application process the Board reviews, among other things, fee payment, background check results, financial stability and capitalization, security and safety procedures, generally accepted agriculture, manufacturing, laboratory, and clinical best practices reports, and adequate insurance policies.
 
The MEDICINAL Act authorizes licensed medical establishments to make deposits in savings and loan institutions duly authorized to do business in Puerto Rico.
 
Importing cannabis or cannabis seeds to Puerto Rico is prohibited by the MEDICINAL Act.
 
The Regulatory Board uses BioTrackTHC as its inventory system to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale. Individual licensees are required to provide data to the Regulatory Board to meet all reporting requirements.
 
Federal Legal Status: Banking
 
Cannabis is still classified as an illegal substance in the U.S. The Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) and the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) currently classify cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substances Act. The classification makes cannabis illegal under federal law to cultivate, manufacture, distribute or possess cannabis, and has created a discrepancy between state’s rights and federal law.
 
This discrepancy has created a complicated environment for cannabis businesses in regards to restrictive banking regulations, interstate trade, IRS tax code and federal bankruptcy laws, especially for companies that directly “touch the plant” such as growers and distributors. For example, FinCEN provided guidance regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their BSA obligations. While we believe we do not qualify as a financial institution in the United States, we cannot be certain that we do not fall under the scope of the FinCEN guidelines. We plan to use the FinCEN Guidelines, as may be amended, as a basis for assessing our relationships with potential tenants, clients and customers. As such, as we engage in financing activities, we intend to adhere to the guidance of FinCEN in conducting and monitoring our financial transactions. Because this area of the law is uncertain but expected to evolve rapidly, we believe that FinCEN’s guidelines will help us best operate in a prudent, reasonable and acceptable manner. There is no assurance, however, that our activities will not violate some aspect of the CSA. If we are found to violate the federal statute or any other in connection with our activities, our company could face serious criminal and civil sanctions.
 
Additionally, because the possession or distribution of cannabis violates federal law, banks that provide services may face the threat of prosecution or sanctions and thus we may have difficulty acquiring or maintaining bank accounts and insurance, and our stockholders may find it difficult to deposit their stock with brokerage firms.
 
The banking issues created by the federal laws have required the cannabis industry to focus on viable alternatives and have created opportunities for new providers, from finance companies to security and software firms. The issue of interstate trade requires companies that grow or distribute cannabis to duplicate efforts within each state they wish to legally operate and has limited the development of ‘national’ brands. These laws do not directly affect companies operating in ancillary businesses.

In February 2014, the White House and the Department of the Treasury gave a roadmap for conducting transactions with cannabis companies operating within state regulations. The most sweeping federal reforms to date, however, have come from Congress in the federal spending bill that passed both Houses in June 2015 and continued in June 2016. Congress voted to protect state medical marijuana and hemp laws from federal interference and cut the DEA’s budget. As an example of increased support for the removal of federal laws banning medical marijuana, the medical marijuana-protecting amendment passed the House 219-189 and became law last year and was accepted by a larger 242-186 majority this year, with even more Republican members’ support.
 
Ancillary Cannabis-Related Businesses
 
As more states enact cannabis legislation, the demand for cannabis-related products and services grows. The rapid expansion of the cannabis market combined with more sophisticated management teams and business models entering the market has spurred the development of numerous cannabis-related niche markets. These ancillary markets that do not physically “touch the plant” include infrastructure and support for the cannabis industry in such areas as social media, security, consulting, delivery systems, financial services, software & high-tech, electronic hardware, infused products, extracts & oils, hemp production, ancillary cultivation solutions, and retail.
 
As mentioned, the federal government still classifies cannabis as a Schedule 1 substance, which leaves many traditional businesses fearing reputational and legal risks of serving the cannabis industry. However, ancillary businesses that do cater to the legal cannabis industry are well positioned to benefit from the growth in the industry.
 
The CBD Industry
 
Market Opportunity
 
According to the Brightfield Group (“Brightfield”), the hemp-derived CBD market will reach sales of $22 billion by 2022, as compared to $591 million in 2018. According to Brightfield, the main drivers of growth would be:

● | Increased investment. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The popularity of hemp CBD versus pharmaceutical products as wellness trends continue. 
● | The evolution of distribution channels. 
● | The expansion of the offering – driven by more product types and constant innovation. 

 
According to Brightfield, 55% of CBD users purchase their CBD products at storefront dispensaries, 31% through local delivery services, and 17% online. Most of the remainder of CBD products are sourced from friends, dealers and cooperatives (8-9% each). Among CBD users, 80% use CBD products at least once a week, and about 41% use them every day. Approximately 4% of CBD consumers are occasional users, turning to CBD products less than once a month. Over half of CBD users have bought 1-2 CBD products over the last two weeks, and roughly 17% have bought 3 or more over the same time period. CBD users tend to enjoy having low or micro-doses of CBD (10 mg or less), once or twice per day.
 
According to Brightfield, the demographic age of CBD users are as follows: the largest group (nearly one third) between ages 35 and 49, and the 26-34 and 50-64 age, ranges each making up 20-25% of the market. Among CBD users, hemp-derived CBD users lean slightly older, more likely to fall into the 50-64 age range, and less likely to fall into the 26-34 age range. In general, significantly more CBD users are female (55%) than male (44%), with that figure being driven up by hemp-derived CBD users, 59% of whom were female. CBD users reflect the general population in terms of income, but within their ranks, slightly more hemp-derived CBD users fall into the lower-income groups (employed but making less than $40K). CBD users are generally well-educated - only 1.3% have not (yet) received their high school diplomas, whereas 15.4% have a graduate or post-grad degree completed. Nearly half of CBD users have a Bachelor’s Degree or beyond. CBD users are the most likely to be married – with 43% having spouses. At least 37% are married among all respondents, and this is the most common status. Just over 30% of CBD users are single.

Competitive Overview
 
Given the rapid growth of the U.S. CBD oil industry, hundreds of companies have entered the market. Consequently, the market is becoming highly competitive and we believe to compete in the market requires ensuring the quality and integrity of product offerings. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial, distribution, and marketing resources, as well as greater brand awareness than us, and there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully compete.
The Difference Between Hemp and Marijuana
 
Both marijuana and hemp come from the same species of plant called “Cannabis Sativa L.” However, cultivators of the cannabis plant have manipulated it over the years to encourage specific traits to become dominant. Cannabis plants contain unique compounds called cannabinoids. Current research has revealed over 80 different cannabinoids thus far, but management believes THC is the most well-known and is credited with causing the marijuana high. While marijuana plants contain high levels of THC, hemp contains very little of the psychoactive chemical. The foregoing is one of the differences which distinguishes hemp from marijuana. 
 
Hemp was originally cultivated nearly 10,000 years ago in what is modern day Taiwan. Ancient cultivators of the cannabis plant recognized that it was dioecious, meaning that it had dual characteristics. Cultivators grew one variety of the cannabis plant to be tall and durable. This became what we now call industrial hemp. Upon discovering that the flower buds of the cannabis plant had psychoactive effects, cultivators began separating the hemp plants from the flowering plants in order to isolate their “medicinal” characteristics.
 
Scientifically, we now know that industrial hemp plants tend to produce high levels of the cannabinoid CBD, while producing low amounts of THC. Conversely, the marijuana plant produces high THC levels and low CBD levels. This chemical difference dictates the way we use the cannabis plant for medicinal and dietary supplemental purposes.

Federal Legislative Overview
 
Cannabidiol, or CBD, that is derived from industrial hemp plants — like the CBD used in all products currently being produced or to be produced by Bespoke Extracts — is deemed by the FDA to be a dietary supplement, not a medication or food product. Consequently, in the U.S., no prescription is required to obtain CBD and it can be legally purchased and consumed in all 50 states (and in 40 countries around the world) unless a state adopts a specific law against its use.
 
In December 2016, the Department of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) implemented a new rule that declared CBD as a Schedule I drug, meaning it has “no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse.” While numerous industry insiders expressed concerns about the DEA’s ruling, it is widely believed that the agency would struggle to make CBD illegal under current laws, thanks to multiple protections put in place by Congress as part of the 2014 Farm Bill. Moreover, subsequent additions to the 2015 and 2016 Congressional Appropriations Act prohibit the DEA from going after the products produced under these programs. Moreover, the most recent version of the legislation to legalize growing hemp was introduced in April 2019, with Senate Majority Speaker Mitch McConnell as the primary sponsor, which quickly evolved into the Senate’s Agriculture Improvement Act of 2019 (2019 Farm Bill). On December 3, 2018, House and Senate leaders announced that they had come to an agreement on the reconciled version of the 2019 Farm Bill, which – for the first time ever – includes a provision to lift the federal government’s longstanding ban on the commercial production of industrial hemp. It also amends the Federal Controlled Substance Act of 1970 so that industrial hemp containing no more than 0.3% delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) is no longer classified as a Schedule I prohibited substance. The 2018 Farm Bill was approved on December 12, 2018.
 
The Company’s CBD products are subject to various state and federal laws regarding the production and sales of hemp-based products. Section 12619 of the 2018 Farm Bill removed “hemp,” as defined in the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (the “1946 Agricultural Act”), from the classification of “marijuana,” which is generally prohibited as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (“CSA”). Under the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill), the term “hemp” means “the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.” As a result of the passage of the 2019 Farm Bill, and since the Company believes that its CBD products contain parts of the cannabis plant with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis, the Company believes that its CBD products are not governed by the CSA and, ergo, would not be subject to prosecution thereunder because the Company believes that its CBD products contain “hemp” within the meaning of the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2019 Farm Bill) and do not contain any “marijuana” as prohibited under the CSA (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill); provided, however, there is a lack of legal protection for hemp-based products that contain more than 0.3 percent THC and there is a risk that the Company would be subject to prosecution under the CSA in the event that its CBD products are found to contain more than 0.3 percent THC. The Company’s CBD products contain no trace of THC at all.

Furthermore, the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill) provides additional regulations regarding the production of hemp-based products and there is the risk that the Company’s CBD products may be found to be in violation of these regulations. Specifically, the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill) contains provisions relating to the shared state-federal jurisdiction over hemp cultivation and production, whereby states and Indian tribes have been delegated the broad authority to regulate and limit the production and sale of hemp and hemp products within their borders. Under the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill), a plan under which a State or Indian tribe monitors and regulates the production of hemp shall only be required to include “(i) a practice to maintain relevant information regarding land on which hemp is produced in the State or territory of the Indian tribe, including a legal description of the land, for a period of not less than 3 calendar years; (ii) a procedure for testing, using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration levels of hemp produced in the State or territory of the Indian tribe; (iii) a procedure for the effective disposal of—(I) plants, whether growing or not, that are produced in violation of this subtitle; and (II) products derived from those plants; (iv) a procedure to comply with enforcement procedures ; (v) a procedure for conducting annual inspections of, at a minimum, a random sample of hemp producers to verify that hemp is not produced in violation of applicable law; (vi) a procedure for submitting the information , as applicable, to the Secretary of Agriculture (the “Secretary”) not more than 30 days after the date on which the information is received; and (vii) a certification that the State or Indian tribe has the resources and personnel to carry out the practices and procedures described in clauses (i) through (vi).” Further, a hemp producer in a State or the territory of an Indian tribe for which a State or Tribal plan is approved shall be determined to have negligently violated the State or Tribal plan, including by negligently— “(i) failing to provide a legal description of land on which the producer produces hemp; (ii) failing to obtain a license or other required authorization from the State department of agriculture or Tribal government, as applicable; or (iii) producing Cannabis sativa L. with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.” A hemp producer that negligently violates a State or Tribal plan 3 times in a 5-year period shall be ineligible to produce hemp for a period of 5 years beginning on the date of the third violation. If the State department of agriculture or Tribal government in a State or the territory of an Indian tribe for which a State or Tribal plan, as applicable, determines that a hemp producer in the State or territory has violated the State or Tribal plan with a culpable mental state greater than negligence— “(i) the State department of agriculture or Tribal government, as applicable, shall immediately report the hemp producer to —(I) the Attorney General; and (II) the chief law enforcement officer of the State or Indian tribe, as applicable.” In the case of a State or Indian tribe for which a State or Tribal plan is not approved, the production of hemp in that State or the territory of that Indian tribe shall be subject to a plan established by the Secretary to monitor and regulate that production. A plan established by the Secretary under shall include— “(A) a practice to maintain relevant information regarding land on which hemp is produced in the State or territory of the Indian tribe, including a legal description of the land, for a period of not less than 3 calendar years; (B) a procedure for testing, using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration levels of hemp produced in the State or territory of the Indian tribe; (C) a procedure for the effective disposal of—(i) plants, whether growing or not, that are produced in violation of applicable law; and (ii) products derived from those plants; (D) a procedure to comply with the enforcement procedures; (E) a procedure for conducting annual inspections of, at a minimum, a random sample of hemp producers to verify that hemp is not produced in violation of this subtitle; and (F) such other practices or procedures as the Secretary considers to be appropriate. The Secretary shall also establish a procedure to issue licenses to hemp producers. In the case of a State or Indian tribe for which a State or Tribal plan is not approved under applicable law, it shall be unlawful to produce hemp in that State or the territory of that Indian tribe without a license issued by the Secretary. A violation of a plan established by the Secretary shall be subject to enforcement and the Secretary shall report the production of hemp without a license issued by the Secretary to the Attorney General. In the event that the Company’s CBD products are found to be in violation of these regulations, the Company may become subject to enforcement action as provided for in the 1946 Agricultural Act (as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill) and may become subject to prosecution thereunder.
 
Furthermore, the Company’s CBD products are subject to the application of laws relating to health and safety of our products. Specifically, the Company’s CBD products may be governed by the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) as a drug. The FD&C Act is intended to assure the consumer, in part, that drugs and devices are safe and effective for their intended uses and that all labeling and packaging is truthful, informative, and not deceptive. The FD&C Act and FDA regulations define the term drug, in part, by reference to its intended use, as “articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease” and “articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.” Therefore, almost any ingested or topical or injectable product that, through its label or labeling (including internet websites, promotional pamphlets, and other marketing material), that is claimed to be beneficial for such uses will be regulated by FDA as a drug. The definition also includes components of drugs, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients. The FD&C Act defines cosmetics by their intended use, as “articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body...for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance.” See FD&C Act, sec. 201(i). Among the products included in this definition are skin moisturizers, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail polishes, eye and facial makeup preparations, cleansing shampoos, permanent waves, hair colors, and deodorants, as well as any substance intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product. Under the FD&C Act, cosmetic products and ingredients, with the exception of color additives, do not require FDA approval before they go on the market. Drugs, however, must generally either receive premarket approval by FDA through the New Drug Application (NDA) process or conform to a “monograph” for a particular drug category, as established by FDA’s Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drug Review. These monographs specify conditions whereby OTC drug ingredients are generally recognized as safe and effective, and not misbranded. Certain OTC drugs may remain on the market without an NDA approval until a monograph for its class of drugs is finalized as a regulation. However, once FDA has made a final determination on the status of an OTC drug category, such products must either be the subject of an approved NDA (see FD&C Act, sec. 505(a) and (b), or comply with the appropriate monograph for an OTC drug.

Additionally, it’s unlawful under the FD&C Act to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. In January of 2019, the New York City Department of Health banned the sale of CBD-infused food products. As of the date hereof, legislators are calling on the FDA to provide guidance on legal pathways for food products infused with CBD to be sold.
 
California State Regulatory Overview: Hemp
 
The commercial cultivation of industrial hemp in California is permitted under state law. The California Department of Food and Agriculture (“CDFA”) issues hemp cultivation licenses through a county’s agricultural commissioner. There is no state registration to grow industrial hemp in California; only county registration is required. All California growers and breeders of industrial hemp are required to register with the county agricultural commissioner prior to cultivation, and registrations are valid for one year from the date of issuance.
 
Additionally, pursuant to an FAQ published by the California Department of Public Health in July 2018, hemp-derived CBD cannot be used as a food ingredient, food additive, or dietary supplement. State law also expressly prohibits bars, liquor stores, and dispensaries from selling alcoholic drinks infused with any cannabinoids, including cannabinoids derived from industrial hemp. California law does not impose any requirements (and licenses are not currently available) for the manufacturing, processing, or sale of non-food industrial hemp or industrial hemp products.
 
As of February 26, 2020, California was in the process of drafting a hemp production plan pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill to be submitted for USDA review.
 
Puerto Rico Regulatory Overview: Hemp
 
The sale of CBD is allowed under local law and it is governed mainly by FDA regulations that prohibit the sale of CBD as food, dietary supplement or as having therapeutic value. The sale of CBD in Puerto Rico is outside the jurisdiction of the Medical Cannabis Regulatory Board and Medical Cannabis laws and regulations. CBD products are not considered nutritional supplements and cannot be marketed as medicine.
 
As of February, 2020, the Health Department issued an administrative guideline requiring all establishments that sale CBD products to have the corresponding warnings in a visible place and make the corresponding disclosures to the consumers.
 
As of the date of this report, the cultivation and manufacture licenses for hemp are issued by the Department of Agriculture and there is a limit of 10 acres of cultivation area. After the approbation of the State Plan, the Department of Agriculture of Puerto Rico has a conservative projection of 10,000 acres of hemp cultivation
