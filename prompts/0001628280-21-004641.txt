ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
CPSI is a leading provider of healthcare solutions and services for community hospitals and other healthcare systems and post-acute care facilities. Founded in 1979, CPSI offers its products and services through four companies - Evident, LLC ("Evident"), TruBridge, LLC ("TruBridge"), American HealthTech, Inc. ("AHT"), and iNetXperts, Corp. d/b/a Get Real Health ("Get Real Health"). These combined companies are focused on improving the health of the communities we serve, connecting communities for a better patient care experience, and improving the financial operations of our clients. The individual contributions of each of these companies towards this combined focus are as follows:
•Evident, which makes up our acute Care EHR reporting segment, provides comprehensive acute care electronic health record ("EHR") solutions, Thrive and Centriq, and related services for community hospitals and their physician clinics.
•AHT, which makes up our post-acute Care EHR reporting segment, provides a comprehensive post-acute care EHR solution and related services for skilled nursing and assisted living facilities.
•TruBridge, our third reporting segment, focuses on providing business management, consulting, and managed information technology ("IT") services along with its complete revenue cycle management ("RCM") solution for all care settings, regardless of their primary healthcare information solutions provider.
•Get Real Health, included within our TruBridge segment, delivers technology solutions to improve patient outcomes and engagement strategies with care providers.
Our companies currently support acute care facilities and post-acute care facilities with a geographically diverse customer mix within the domestic community healthcare market. Our target market for our acute care solutions includes community hospitals with fewer than 200 acute care beds. Our primary focus within this defined target market is on hospitals with fewer than 100 beds, which comprise approximately 98% of our acute care hospital EHR customer base. Our target market for our TruBridge services includes community hospitals with fewer than 600 acute care beds. The target market for our post-acute care solutions consists of approximately 15,500 skilled nursing facilities that are either independently owned or part of a larger management group with multiple facilities. During 2020, we generated revenues of $264.5 million from the sale of our products and services.
Industry Dynamics
The healthcare industry is the largest industry in the United States economy, comprising approximately 17.7% of the U.S. gross domestic product in 2019 according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"). CMS estimates that by fiscal 2028, total U.S. healthcare spending will reach $6.2 trillion, or 19.7% of the estimated U.S. gross domestic product.
Hospital services represents one of the largest categories of total healthcare expenditures, comprising approximately 31% of total healthcare expenditures in 2019 according to the National Center for Health Services. According to the American Hospital Association’s AHA Hospital Statistics, 2021 Edition, there are approximately 3,900 community hospitals in the United States that are in our target market of hospitals with fewer than 200 beds, with approximately 2,900 of those in our primary area of focus of fewer than 100 acute care beds. In addition, there is a market of small specialty hospitals that focus on discrete medical areas such as surgery, rehabilitation and long-term acute care.
Notwithstanding the size and importance of the healthcare industry within the United States economy, the industry is constantly challenged by changing economic dynamics, increased regulation and pressure to improve the quality of healthcare. These challenges are particularly significant for the hospitals in our target market due to their more limited financial and human resources and their dependency on Medicare and Medicaid populations for a substantial portion of their revenue. However, we believe healthcare providers can successfully address these issues with the help of advanced medical information systems and our suite of complementary services. Specific examples of the challenges and opportunities facing healthcare providers include the following:
Changing Economic Dynamics
The economy of the healthcare industry, although not immune to general macroeconomic conditions, is heavily impacted by legislative and regulatory initiatives of the federal and state governments. These legislative and regulatory initiatives have a 
particularly significant impact on our customer base, as community hospitals typically generate a significant portion of their revenues from beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Consequently, even small changes in these federal and state programs have a disproportionately larger effect on community hospitals as compared to larger facilities where greater portions of their revenues are typically generated from beneficiaries of private insurance programs. Medicare and Medicaid funding and reimbursements fluctuate year to year and, with the growth in healthcare costs, will continue to be scrutinized as the federal and state governments attempt to control the costs and growth of the program. The Medicaid program, which is a federal/state program managed by the individual states and dependent in part on funding from the states, also continues to experience funding issues due to the increasing cost of healthcare and limited state revenues.
Mandatory cuts in federal spending resulting from the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the "Budget Control Act") became effective in March 2013. Although Medicaid is specifically exempted from the cuts mandated by the legislation, the Budget Control Act includes a reduction of up to 2% in federal Medicare spending, which has been achieved by reduced reimbursements to healthcare providers. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, more commonly referred to as the Affordable Care Act (the "ACA"), has put into effect a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare and Medicaid program spending by significant amounts. As the federal government seeks in the future to further limit deficit spending due to fiscal restraints, it will likely continue to cut entitlement spending programs such as Medicare and Medicaid matching grants, which will place further cost pressures on hospitals and other healthcare providers. Furthermore, federal and state budget shortfalls, exacerbated by the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic, as described below, could lead to potential reductions in funding for Medicare and Medicaid. Further reductions in reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid could lead to hospitals postponing expenditures on information technology.
While legislative and regulatory initiatives are placing significant pressure on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, our customer base of community hospitals is also likely faced with increases in demand for Medicare and Medicaid services. We expect that the demand for Medicare and Medicaid services will increase for the foreseeable future due to the growing number of people born during the post-World War II baby boom that are becoming eligible for Medicare benefits at age 65, as well as states electing to expand Medicaid coverage under the provisions of the ACA. The challenges posed by this dual-threat of increased demand for Medicare and Medicaid services and downward pressure on reimbursements are further complicated by the shift away from volume-based reimbursement towards value-based reimbursement, linking reimbursement to quality measurements and outcomes.
Compounding the combined effects of a likely increase in demand for Medicare and Medicaid services and persistent pressure on related reimbursements, the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plans and value-based reimbursement models is transforming domestic healthcare delivery into a more patient-centric experience. This transformation brings about new and increased data needs, resulting in additional regulatory demands for data that patients find useful in decision-making. These new regulatory demands increase regulatory risks and compliance burdens for CPSI and our clients, but also pose opportunities for CPSI to provide additional value-added products and services to our target market.
One such regulatory demand, the price transparency mandate, became effective in January 2021 for all U.S. hospitals. This mandate requires that hospitals publicly post, online and in a searchable, consumer-friendly manner, standard charge information for at least 300 shopable services, which gives patients the ability to compare payer-specific negotiated charges across healthcare settings. In response to this mandate, we announced in July 2020 the availability of a pricing transparency solution that gives patients the ability to shop for healthcare services based on price, supporting a more patient-driven healthcare experience.
To compete in the continually changing healthcare environment, providers are increasingly using technology in order to help maximize the efficiency of their business practices, to assist in enhancing patient care, and to maintain the privacy and security of patient information. Healthcare providers are placing increased demands on their information systems to accomplish these tasks. We believe that information systems must facilitate management of patient information across administrative, financial and clinical tasks. Information systems must also effectively interface with a variety of payor organizations within the increasingly complex reimbursement environment.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
In 2009, the U.S. federal government enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the "ARRA"), which included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"). HITECH authorized the EHR incentive program, which provided significant incentive funding to physicians and hospitals that can prove they have adopted and are appropriately using technology such as our EHR solutions. The level to which healthcare providers must prove they are effectively utilizing such solutions in order to qualify for these incentives is measured through an escalating criteria designated as "meaningful use." As a result of our obtaining the required certifications and our track record with our hospital customers 
successfully achieving meaningful use, the ARRA continues to have a positive impact on our business and the businesses of the community hospitals that comprise our target market.
Similarly, compliance with the meaningful use rules accelerated the purchases of incremental applications by our existing clients. Consequently, our penetration rates within our existing customer base for our current menu of applications have increased significantly under the ARRA, thereby significantly narrowing the market for add-on sales to existing clients in future years. As a result of the announcement from CMS on August 2, 2018 of a final rule changing the attestation period for 2019 and 2020 to any continuous 90-day period instead of the previously-required full year attestation period, hospitals had until October 1, 2019 to install compliant technology in order to meet the requirements of the program during 2019, compared to a deadline of January 1, 2019 under the previous rule. The stage three requirements of the meaningful use program (re-named "Promoting Interoperability" by such rule) provided a significant opportunity for add-on sales revenues during 2017 through 2019. The passing of the October 1, 2019 compliance deadline resulted in reduced MU3-related revenue opportunities throughout 2020. 
Continued Push for Improved Patient Care
With the increased pressure to improve the quality of healthcare and reduce costs, there is a general shift towards value-based reimbursement, which increases the demand for information technology solutions for clinical decision support. This migration toward clinical decision support solutions is further supported by the ARRA. Provisions of the ARRA offered incentives for hospitals to become meaningful users of EHRs through September 2015. Hospitals and healthcare providers that did not implement and demonstrate meaningful use of EHRs by October 1, 2014 were penalized with lower Medicare payment levels after that date.
In the face of decreasing revenue and increasing pressure to improve patient care, healthcare providers are in need of management tools and related services that (1) increase efficiency in the delivery of healthcare services, (2) reduce medical errors, (3) effectively track the cost of delivering services so that those costs can be properly managed and (4) increase the speed and rate of reimbursement. A hospital’s failure to adequately invest in a modern medical information system could result in fewer patient referrals, cost inefficiencies, lower than expected reimbursement, increased malpractice risk and possible regulatory infractions. Additionally, we believe that the industry will continue to increase its utilization of third party services that contribute to the achievement of these and other objectives necessary for success in the current environment. We believe these dynamics should allow for future revenue growth for both our information technology solutions and our complementary suite of services.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The healthcare industry is at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic, with heroic efforts by healthcare providers on the frontlines and advances in technology and science bringing vaccines to market in an unprecedented timeframe. Looking beyond 2020, we believe the pandemic could lead to an acceleration of macro trends already developing in the industry. For example, it is likely that the pandemic advances the role of the federal government as the top regulator and payor for healthcare and that financial distress resulting from the pandemic increases the pace of health system consolidations. Additionally, the quick pivot to virtual healthcare in response to the pandemic has increased consumer expectations, particularly around the convenience of telemedicine and digital health options.
This quick pivot to virtual healthcare accelerated the ongoing increasing demand for telemedicine solutions and services, with recent history suggesting an evolving reimbursement environment that is becoming more receptive to telemedicine with each passing year. In response to this trend and the necessity for virtual care imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated the product roadmap for Get Real Health’s Talk With Your Doc telehealth portal. The product was introduced for general release by April 2020 and was provided to customers free of charge for the remainder of the year.
Strategy
Our objective is to increase the market share of our TruBridge services, aggressively pursue competitive and vulnerable EHR replacement opportunities, and differentiate our products and services on a client experience basis that enables us to sell a broader set of services into a loyal base of clients that are our advocates. During 2020, we took pause and engaged a top-tier international consulting firm to assess our company-wide growth strategy. The outcome of this eight-week effort was the confirmation of our current strategy of cross-selling TruBridge into the existing EHR base, expanding TruBridge market share with sales to new community and larger health systems, and pursuing competitive EHR takeaway opportunities. 
The healthcare industry is in the midst of transitioning to value-based reimbursement, care coordination and interoperability. Our strategy is to position our services and solutions with community healthcare providers so that they are able to respond to these changes positively by enabling them to improve community health and connect providers and patients within the 
community and with other communities, while improving financial operations. We intend to leverage several strengths to accomplish this goal.
Market Share/Scale 
Over the course of our more than 40 year history of providing valuable technology solutions and services to the acute care and post acute care environments, we have developed a significant customer base of community hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. This customer base is our most valuable asset, providing us with the critical mass necessary to scale our development, client support and service resources to meet the ever changing needs of our customers. In doing so, we solidify our position as a long-term partner with a proven track record in meeting the unique needs of community healthcare.
EHR Solutions Across the Care Continuum
Our EHR solutions address the entire continuum of care, with systems that address the three primary care settings: ambulatory care, inpatient acute care and post-acute care. This enables providers to coordinate patient care across the major settings where care is delivered. New payment models in both the government and private payer sectors are focused on payment for delivering quality outcomes and keeping patients well while still delivering financial efficiencies. These financial efficiencies are realized through the elimination of duplicate tests performed in different care settings, as well as providing timely access to clinical information from other care settings, when making diagnostic decisions. Having integrated solutions across the care continuum facilitates this process for providers and healthcare organizations.
Solutions and Services to Address Value-Based Reimbursement
With the continued emphasis on value-based reimbursement models, data analytics has become a critical tool for community healthcare providers to enable them to shift from reactive to proactive care delivery. We currently offer business intelligence as the first facet of a three-phase approach to analytics solutions, which we plan to expand to include predictive and prescriptive analytics. Because of the complexity inherent in data analytics, we will provide services to healthcare providers to assist them with certain aspects of data modeling and data analysis.
Interoperability
We currently provide integration across our ambulatory and inpatient EHR solutions. This integration was expanded to encompass our post-acute care EHR product in 2016. In addition, as a founding member of the CommonWell Health Alliance, we enable healthcare organizations to identify, confirm and link patient encounters across the CommonWell network. This translates into patient data that is not only shareable within communities but across communities as well.
Focus on the Financial Health of Community Healthcare Providers
Given the ongoing transition to value-based reimbursement models, community healthcare providers are under more financial pressure than ever before, and financial health and stability is essential to their longevity and survival. Our accounts receivable management services incorporate proven workflow and processes as well as industry leading revenue cycle management tools. A new aspect of many current payment models is an increasing shift of the financial burden to the patient. Community hospitals typically underperform in private pay collections because of the nature of community healthcare but cannot afford to forego the patient portion of contributions. Through our private pay services, providers can bring in much needed private pay receipts without alienating the local community.
Our operational expertise and technology tools provide proven results in improving claim acceptance rates, accelerating payments from third party payers and increasing private pay collections. We also differentiate our services by working to maintain employment in the community by hiring displaced employees into TruBridge to continue their functional role under TruBridge program management.
Strategic Uses of Capital
2020 marked the culmination of a years-long evolution in the capital allocation strategy of CPSI, a strategy designed to afford the flexibility necessary to be adaptive and opportunistic with future capital allocation decisions. Such flexibility is necessary if we are to continue to bring timely products and services to a rapidly changing healthcare landscape, serving the needs of multiple stakeholder groups as customers benefit from the related products and services and our stockholders benefit from the increasing diversity in revenue sources. Specific components of this years-long evolution include:
•Reducing our leverage profile, while increasing capital availability: Since December 31, 2017, our total bank debt has decreased from $143.5 million to $78.1 million, while the amount available under our revolving credit facility has increased from $17.0 million to $105.0 million. 
•Refinancing our debt: In June 2020, we refinanced our outstanding indebtedness with the primary objectives of increasing the maximum borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility from $50.0 million to $110.0 million and removing absolute-dollar limits on acquisition activity.
•Announcing a share repurchase program, while simultaneously suspending all quarterly dividends: In September 2020, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $30.0 million of its outstanding shares of common stock over a two-year period. Concurrent with the approval of the stock repurchase program, the Board of Directors opted to indefinitely suspend all quarterly dividends. These joint actions allow CPSI to continue its commitment to returning capital to shareholders, while at the same time enhancing our flexibility to adapt to an ever-changing landscape of alternative uses of capital.
Explore Additional Revenue Streams that Complement Existing Markets, Solutions and Services
In the EHR space, we are selling our ambulatory EHR solutions on a standalone basis with a focus on communities that already have one of our EHR solutions installed in an acute care setting. Also, we are actively pursuing expansion of our inpatient EHR product into the Canadian market through our own direct efforts and collaboration with key Canadian technology providers. In the United States EHR market, we are targeting other types of providers who have lagged behind inpatient acute care in EHR adoption such as ambulatory surgery centers, behavioral health facilities and inpatient psychiatric hospitals. In the post-acute care market, we are now providing an EHR solution for assisted living facilities in conjunction with our own post-acute care EHR for skilled nursing operators. In the services business we will continue to look for opportunities to add or increase services resulting from changing market dynamics, availability of technology or operational expertise, or changes in regulatory requirements. 
Our Products and Services
Evident and American HealthTech provide tailored IT solutions that effectively address the specific needs of small and midsize hospitals and their physician clinics, as well as skilled nursing facilities of all sizes across the U.S. Their broad offerings of software products and services collect, process, retain, and report data in the primary functional areas of these healthcare providers, from patient care to clinical processing to administration and accounting. Due to their smaller operating budgets, community hospitals have limited financial and human resources to operate manual or inefficient information systems. However, these hospitals are expected to achieve the same quality of care and regulatory compliance as larger hospitals, placing them in a particularly difficult operating environment. These pressures on the operating environments of community hospitals were increased with the passage of the ARRA in 2009 which, in addition to providing incentives to healthcare providers to achieve meaningful use of EHR, has resulted in lowered Medicare payment levels for healthcare providers that have yet to achieve meaningful use of EHR.
We believe that our acute care IT solutions meet these challenges facing community hospitals by providing fully integrated, enterprise-wide and ARRA-certified medical information systems and services that are compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"). Further, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, TruBridge, we offer business management, consulting and managed IT services, along with its full RCM solution, that allow our acute and post-acute care clients to outsource all or just a portion of their business office function. Consulting and other services help clients avoid some of the fixed costs of a business office and leverage our expertise and resources in helping them identify their IT objectives, define the best way to meet those requirements and manage the resulting projects and associated technologies. As a result, we are capable of providing a single-source solution to healthcare organizations, making us a partner in their initiatives to improve operations and medical care.
As a key component to providing complete solutions, we maintain strong partnerships with our clients through a variety of two-way communication channels, including our support teams, role-based user groups, client councils, client work groups, our annual National Client Conference and other organized events and venues that foster insightful and meaningful communication. By listening to our clients and staying abreast of market trends, we strive to provide the right healthcare solutions at the right time to help meet the specific business needs of acute and post-acute care organizations. Our business has continued to grow because we have successfully provided fully integrated, enterprise-wide information systems that allow community hospitals, their physician clinics and skilled nursing facilities to improve operating effectiveness, reduce costs and improve the quality of patient care.

Acute Care Support and Maintenance Services
After a customer installs Thrive or Centriq, we provide software application support, hardware maintenance, continuing education and related services pursuant to a support agreement using our collaborative support model. The following describes services provided to customers using Thrive and Centriq:
• Total System Support. We believe the quality of continuing customer support is one of the most critical considerations in the selection of an information system provider. We provide hardware, technical and software support for all aspects of our system, which gives us the flexibility to take the necessary course of action to resolve any issue. Unlike our competitors who use third-party services for hardware and software support, we provide a single, convenient and efficient resource for all of our customers’ system support needs. In order to minimize the impact of a system problem, we train our customer service personnel to be technically proficient, courteous and prompt. Because a properly functioning information system is crucial to a hospital’s operations, our support teams are available 24 hours per day to assist customers with any problem that may arise. Customers can also use the Internet to directly access our support system. 
• National Client Conference. All of our customers have the opportunity to attend our annual National Client Conference. CPSI hosts this conference to provide our customers educational sessions, product demonstrations, and one-on-one time with application experts. The conference also allows important time for networking among customers and CPSI staff across all business platforms.
• Continuing Education. Effective learning tools are a key factor in successful EHR adoption and allowing clients to get the most out of a software investment. Therefore, ongoing learning and training is a cornerstone to our “total solution” and a key competitive differentiator. Our ongoing learning and training offerings also address some of the unique needs of community hospitals - limited resources and staff with cross-department responsibilities and budget and time constraints - all of which require a customized approach to learning and training. To meet these needs, Evident offers customers with online content that can be accessed at any time, scheduled online interactive classroom presentations, on-campus training at our facilities in Mobile, Alabama and Minneapolis, Minnesota, educational sessions during user group conferences, and scheduled regional training sessions. 
• Software Releases. We are committed to providing our customers with software and technology solutions that will continue to meet their information system needs. To accomplish this purpose, we continually work to enhance and improve our application programs. As part of this effort, for each customer covered under our general support agreement, we provide software updates as they become available at no additional cost. We design these enhancements to be seamlessly integrated into each customer’s existing system. The benefit of these enhancements is that each customer, regardless of its original installation date, uses the most advanced software available. Through this process, we can keep our customers up-to-date with the latest operational innovations in the healthcare industry as well as with changing governmental regulatory requirements. Another benefit of this "one system" concept is that our customer service teams can be more effective in responding to customer needs because they maintain a complete understanding of and familiarity with the one system that all customers use.
 Purchasing a new information technology system requires the expenditure of a substantial amount of capital and other resources, and many customers are concerned that these systems will become obsolete as technology changes. Our periodic product updates eliminate our customers’ concerns about system obsolescence. We believe providing this benefit is a strong incentive for potential customers to select our products over the products of our competitors.
• Hardware Replacement. As part of our general support agreements, we are also committed to promptly replacing malfunctioning system hardware in order to minimize the effect of operational interruptions. By offering replacements of all hardware used in our system, we believe we are better able to meet and address all of the information technology needs of our customers.
• Cloud Electronic Health Record (Cloud EHR). We offer Cloud EHR services to customers via remote access telecommunications. Cloud EHR is a "Software as a Service" (or "SaaS") configuration and is in essence a subscription to access and use application software maintained by CPSI in a cloud environment for a monthly fee. Under this configuration, a customer is able to obtain access to an advanced EHR without a significant initial capital outlay. We store and maintain all Cloud EHR customers’ critical patient and administrative data 
using TruBridge Cloud Computing Services. These customers access this information remotely through direct telecommunications connections.
• Forms and Supplies. In addition to our support services, we offer our customers the standard and customized forms that they need for their patient and financial records, as well as the supplies necessary to support the operation of their server and peripheral equipment. Furnishing these forms and supplies helps us to achieve our objective of being a one-source solution for a hospital’s complete healthcare information system requirements.

Product Development and Enhancement
The healthcare information technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change requiring us to continually make investments to update, enhance and improve our products and services. These investments have resulted in total expenditures related to our Product Development Services division of approximately $33.5 million, $36.9 million, and $36.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Product Management
We formally announced our product management team in November 2018, and in 2019 we began to apply new product management principles throughout our organization to better utilize our valuable resources and maximize value creation and innovation. This team is responsible for launching products, providing industry insight and identifying emerging segments within our target markets. By focusing on the right workflows, aligning the appropriate stakeholders and establishing clear roles and responsibilities, CPSI can make better product decisions faster. The key tenets of product management are being the best stewards of our resources and enabling growth.
By working with the various internal stakeholders (product development, marketing, sales and support), as well as external stakeholders (customers, industry subject matter experts), the product management team takes new product and service ideas and creates a business case for each of the initiatives. We have created a Provider Council, Nursing Council and CFO Council to assist with these efforts as well.
The goals of the product management team are to understand our customers and identify the value of various ideas, by considering customer retention and satisfaction, support and training impact and revenue potential. The initiatives become part of our initiative portfolio and are evaluated against each other. We use this view of the portfolio to manage risks within the portfolio and allow us to create the most value for each investment we make. We are experiencing successes with this approach, as evidenced by increased product innovation and related momentum.
System Implementation and Training
Conversion Services. When a client purchases or leases one of our systems, we convert their existing data to the new system. Our knowledge of hospital data processing, in conjunction with extensive in-house technical expertise, allows us to accomplish this task in a cost effective manner. When we install a new system, the data conversion has already occurred so that the system is immediately operational. Our goal is for each client to be productive day one in order to eliminate time and money wasted on the costly and inefficient task of maintaining the same data on parallel systems. Our services also relieve the hospital staff of the time-consuming burden of data conversion. The conversion process is the initial phase of our long-term partnership and overall client experience.
Training. In order to integrate the new system and to ensure its success, we spend approximately sixteen weeks providing individualized training remotely and on-site at the go-live. We provide hardware and software application training for all hospital users, including staff members and healthcare providers, during all hospital shifts. We employ nurses, medical technicians, and providers along with our technical training staff in order to help us communicate more effectively with our clients during the training process. This training phase is also part of the overall client experience that is provided to all of our clients.
Clients, Sales and Marketing
Target Markets
The target market for our acute care EHR systems consists of community hospitals with fewer than 200 acute care beds, with a primary focus on hospitals with fewer than 100 acute care beds. In the United States, there are approximately 3,900 community hospitals with fewer than 200 acute care beds, with approximately 2,900 of these having fewer than 100 acute care beds. In addition, we market our products to small specialty hospitals in the United States that focus on discrete medical areas such as behavioral health, surgery, rehabilitation and long-term acute care. Approximately 98% of our existing acute care clients are hospitals with fewer than 100 acute care beds, while approximately 99% of our existing acute care clients are hospitals with fewer than 200 acute care beds.
The target market for our post-acute care EHR solution consists of approximately 15,500 long-term care and skilled nursing facilities in the United States. In addition, through a strategic relationship with Medtelligent, we are able to market an EHR for assisted living facilities creating add-on sales opportunities in our direct client base and new sales opportunities across the broader senior living market.
The expanded target market for our TruBridge services consists of small to mid-size hospitals in the United States. There are approximately 4,850 of these hospitals with fewer than 500 beds. In addition, we are now marketing our services to post-acute care facilities, of which there are approximately 15,500 in the United States. 
In the acute care provider market, we are now actively marketing our EHR system to English speaking countries outside the United States, including Canada. We have established business relationships with key Canadian healthcare and technology providers which we believe will be a significant factor in penetrating the Canadian market. We have concluded our evaluation of the unique requirements of the Canadian healthcare system and are actively working on incorporating the necessary changes into our Thrive acute care EHR product. 
Our goals in the inpatient hospital market are threefold: (1) target those hospitals under 100 beds in the United States that we believe are currently using a vendor that we have determined is vulnerable based on a variety of factors, (2) continue our efforts to expand into English speaking countries outside the U.S. through active marketing efforts and establishing strategic business relationships, and (3) selectively target hospitals in the 100 to 200 bed market that we believe offer a reasonable chance of sales success based on size, location and other factors. Our goal in the ambulatory market is to aggressively target physician practices in those communities where the local hospital is a current CPSI client.
Our goal in the post-acute care market is to continue to target both individual facilities as well as larger multi-facility corporate entities. In addition, we intend to extend our penetration into the post-acute care market by offering an assisted living facility EHR solution that we believe will broaden the appeal of our solutions to those operators who offer multiple care settings in their organizations.
The following table presents our revenues generated from clients located within the U.S. ("Domestic") and all foreign countries, in total ("International").

(1) International sales revenues for 2018 are related solely to the Caribbean nation of St. Maarten, while revenues during 2019 and 2020 also include amounts related to the islands of Turks and Caicos, Canada, England, Australia, and the Netherlands.

Sales Staff
We have dedicated sales organizations in all three business lines: acute care EHR, post-acute care EHR and business management, consulting and managed IT services. Many of our sales personnel are hired from within the Company and have previous experience in client support roles. We believe this experience positions them to more effectively sell our products and services within our target markets. Our sales organizations are generally divided into four areas: sales management, new client sales, existing client sales and sales support staff. New client sales staff are typically organized based on geographic territories, though we also have sales personnel that focus on national accounts in our post-acute care EHR business due to the number of national chain operators in that market. Our sales representatives who sell to existing clients have assigned clients within their territory, which is also geographically based. Some sales representatives in our services areas are assigned specifically to cross-sell services into our acute care EHR and post-acute care EHR client bases. A significant portion of the compensation for all sales personnel except for administrative support staff is commission based.
Marketing Strategy
Our corporate marketing strategy positions CPSI as a healthcare solutions company serving community healthcare organizations through our family of healthcare information technology ("HCIT") companies. Our EHR software and services address providers across the care continuum, with a primary focus on the community healthcare market. We believe our ability to serve ambulatory, acute and post-acute care settings with our products will be especially appealing as new reimbursement models force the coordination of care by healthcare providers. Our ability to connect patients to care providers within their community and across communities through our own products and interoperability development, including our membership in the CommonWell Health Alliance, sets us apart from other competitors in our market. Our goal is to position ourselves as partners to community healthcare providers as they move to a more proactive care model based on the use of data analytics and patient engagement tools.
With regard to business management, consulting and managed IT services, we will continue to leverage our proven track record of success in accounts receivable management and private pay collections for community healthcare providers. With the increasing complexity of reimbursement requirements and a global shift in healthcare towards an increase in patient financial responsibility, the ability of our services business to bring expertise and best practice operational efficiencies to bear is a significant competitive advantage. In consulting services, the added complexity brought about by the transition to the ICD-10 code set, a standard transaction code set for diagnostic purposes under HIPAA, has created a significant demand for our coding services. Our strategy is to leverage any services engagement, whether business, IT or consulting, into opportunities to cross-sell other services to the client.
Backlog
Backlog consists of revenues we reasonably expect to recognize over the next twelve months under existing contracts. The revenues to be recognized may relate to a combination of one-time fees for system sales and recurring fees for support and maintenance and TruBridge services. As of December 31, 2020, we had a twelve-month backlog of approximately $10 million in connection with non-recurring system purchases and approximately $242 million in connection with recurring payments under support and maintenance and TruBridge services. As of December 31, 2019, we had a twelve-month backlog of approximately $15 million in connection with non-recurring system purchases and approximately $235 million in connection with recurring payments under support and maintenance and TruBridge services.
Competition
The market for our products and services is competitive, and we expect additional competition from established and emerging companies in the future. Our market is characterized by rapidly changing technology, global shifts in the healthcare system, evolving user needs and impactful regulatory and reimbursement changes. We believe the principal competitive factors that hospitals, clinics and post-acute care providers consider when choosing between us and our competitors are:
•product features, functionality and performance;
•range of services offered;
•level of client service and satisfaction;
•ease of integration and speed of implementation;
•product price;
•cost of services offered;
•results of services engagements;
•knowledge of the healthcare industry;
•training provided;
•sales and marketing efforts; and
•company reputation.
We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on these factors. Our principal competitors in the acute care EHR market are Cerner Corporation, Medical Information Technology, Inc. ("Meditech"), and MEDHOST, Inc. These companies compete with us directly in our target market of small and midsize hospitals. They offer products and systems that are comparable to our system and address the needs of hospitals in the markets we serve.
Our secondary competitors in the acute care EHR market include Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. and Epic Systems Corporation. These companies are significantly larger than we are, and they typically sell their products and services to larger hospitals outside of our target market. However, they will sometimes compete with us directly or, more commonly, when a larger health system who uses a system from one of these companies will offer it to a smaller hospital as part of a merger or alliance. 
We also face competition from providers of practice management systems, general decision support and database systems and other segment-specific applications. Any of these companies as well as other technology or healthcare companies could decide at any time to specifically target hospitals within our target market.
Our principal competitors in the post-acute care EHR market are PointClickCare Corporation and MatrixCare, Inc. These companies compete with us directly in our target market of long-term post-acute care facilities. They offer products and systems that are comparable to our system and address the needs of long-term care providers. 
Our principal competitors in the business management, consulting and managed IT services market are Healthcare Resource Group, Inc., Resolution Health, Inc., The Outsource Group Inc., Patient Focus, Inc., Xtend Healthcare Inc., Ensemble Health Partners, and nThrive, Inc. All of these companies provide one or more of the services we offer, with their primary focus being on business management services. The services they offer are comparable in scope to the competing services we offer. These companies all focus on providing services to the healthcare market. Secondary competitors include ARx LLC, Citadel Outsource Group LLC, Patient Matters, LLC, KIWI-TEK, LLC, and Aviacode Inc. Our principle competitors for RCM solutions include RelayHealth Corp, SSI Group, LLC, Quadax Inc., Change Healthcare Holdings, Inc., Availity, LLC, and Navicure, Inc. Get Real Health's primary competitors include Relay Health, Get Well Network/Healthloop, Apollo Care Connect, Bridge Paitent Portal, eClinicalWorks Patient Portal, Influence Health, and InteliChart.
Actual or perceived security breaches of our systems could harm the market perception of our products and services which could impact our retention of existing clients and ability to acquire prospective clients.
Health Information Security and Privacy Practices
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") is a federal law governing the use, disclosure, transmission and storage of certain individually identifiable health information, referred to as "protected health information," and that was enacted for the purpose of, among other things, protecting the privacy and security of protected health information. As directed by HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services (the "DHHS") has promulgated standards and rules for certain electronic health transactions, code sets, data security, unique identification numbers and privacy of protected health information. HIPAA and the standards promulgated by DHHS apply to certain health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers (referred to as "covered entities"), which includes our hospital and post-acute care clients. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations published in January 2013 (the "HITECH Act") significantly expand HIPAA by extending privacy and security standards to "business associates" of healthcare providers that are covered entities. Under the HITECH Act, business associates are required to establish administrative, physical and technical safeguards and are subject to direct penalties for violations. Certain of our services frequently entail us acting as a healthcare clearinghouse and/or in the capacity of a business associate to the hospitals and post-acute care clients that we serve. As a result, we are covered by the patient privacy and security standards of HIPAA and subject to oversight by DHHS. We believe that we have taken all necessary steps to comply with HIPAA, as it applies to us as a business associate, but it is important to note that DHHS could, at any time in the future, adopt new rules or modify existing rules in a manner that could require us to change our systems or operations.
Protecting individually identifiable health information and other sensitive data is a critical and essential function of CPSI’s operations and its software solutions. A variety of industry-standard approaches that meet or exceed regulatory requirements such as HIPAA and HITECH are employed. In order to avoid unauthorized access for the life span of this data, diverse methods of identification, authentication, authorization and encryption are utilized at various points throughout the operating system, application software and hardware. These methods and processes are shared amongst servers and other end-user devices and are complemented by change management processes and tools, which allow the software change control cycle to be a formal, defined process.
Managing Cybersecurity Risks
Our business operations, including the provision of the products and services described above, involve the compilation and transmission of confidential information, including patient health information. We have included security features in our systems that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of this information, but our systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, viruses, programming errors and other similar disruptive problems.
The Board of Directors is responsible for exercising oversight of management’s identification of, and planning for, the material risks facing the Company, and we believe our policies and procedures are adequate to ensure that relevant information about cybersecurity risks and incidents is appropriately reported and disclosed. During 2020, the Board authorized the formation of an Innovation and Technology Committee comprised of members of the Board. This Committee’s responsibilities include, but are not limited to, more closely monitoring and collaborating with the Company’s Governance, Risk & Compliance (“GRC”) Committee. The purpose of the GRC is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to the Company's risk management, ethics programs, and information security/privacy programs. The oversight responsibility of the GRC includes, but is not limited to, planning and conducting audits, conducting investigations, assuring compliance with relevant laws, and ensuring compliance with the Company's Code of Conduct and Business Ethics and related policies. The GRC consists of a cross functional leadership team including the Executive Vice President, Chief Technology Officer, Corporate Information Security Officer, Corporate Compliance Officer, Corporate Counsel, and Chief Financial Officer. 
Additionally, we appointed a Security Operations Center ("SOC") Director to oversee a number of initiatives designed to improve our cybersecurity protection, readiness and response. The Company partnered with a third party to provide Security as a Service ("SECaaS") to assist our internal SOC in reducing the likelihood and impact of a cybersecurity attack. The SOC oversees penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, intrusion prevention, endpoint and insider threat detection, log management and other cybersecurity-related projects. The Company consulted with third parties in 2017 and 2018 to conduct an evaluation of our cybersecurity risks. The Company also consulted with third parties during 2019 and 2020 related to the Company's efforts to achieve ISO 27001 certification related to information security management, which was achieved during 2020. Finally, all users employed by or contracted to the Company are required to complete annual cybersecurity education and training, which includes identifying suspicious emails, internet threats, telecommunication threats and ransomware.
Early in 2020, it became apparent that, for the safety and well-being of employees in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company would need to transition from a primarily work-from-office based workforce to a work-from-home based workforce. A phased approach was designed in order for our employees to remain focused on maintaining daily operations, continuing a high level of client support and minimizing impact to the culture, all while not introducing vulnerabilities into our information 
technology systems. While the vast majority of employees were fully remote in a very short period of time, those unable to work remotely continued to work from the office following guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although a portion of our workforce has returned to in-office environments, the successful expansion of work-from-home arrangements during the past year, in terms of employee productivity and satisfaction, has resulted in many of these arrangements becoming permanent. As such, we anticipate that our go-forward workforce will be more heavily distributed to remote work environments.
Intellectual Property
We regard some aspects of our internal operations, software and documentation as proprietary, and rely primarily on a combination of contract and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary information. We believe, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry, trade secret and copyright protection is less significant than factors such as the knowledge, ability and experience of our employees, frequent software product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of our support services. The source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret. We enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and clients, and control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. We cannot guarantee that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.
We do not believe our software products or other CPSI proprietary rights infringe on the property rights of third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us with respect to current or future software products or that any such assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation.
Material Government Regulations
Our business operations are subject to various federal and state laws, and our products and services are governed by a number of rules and regulations.  For example, we are affected by the following regulations:
•As discussed above, the HIPAA security and privacy standards affect our claims transmission services, since those services must be structured and provided in a way that supports our clients’ HIPAA compliance obligations.
•The United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has determined that certain of our solutions, such as our ImageLink® product, are medical devices that are actively regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended.
•The use of our solutions by physicians for electronic prescribing and electronic routing of prescriptions via the Surescripts network to pharmacies is governed by federal and state laws.  States have differing regulations that govern the electronic transmission of certain prescriptions and prescription requirements.
Although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws, rules and other regulations applicable to our operations, products or services will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate materially increased expenditures in response to government regulations or future material impacts to our results or competitiveness.  These regulations and related risks are described in more detail below under “Risk Factors” beginning on page 23 of this Annual Report.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,000 employees, the substantial majority of which are located at our offices in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We recognize that attracting, motivating, developing and retaining talent at all levels is vital to continuing our success. By improving employee satisfaction, retention and engagement, we also improve our ability to support our customers and protect the long-term interests of our stockholders. 
COVID-19 Response
During the COVID-19 pandemic, our primary focus has been the safety and well-being of our employees and their families. We implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interests of our employees as well as the communities 
in which we operate. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. All employees were offered no-cost telemedicine visits for any COVID-related symptoms or illness. Increased flexibility in hours and days was also offered to our in-office employees as childcare or other needs dictated. Additionally, at the onset of the pandemic, we notified our employees that we would not execute any payroll cost mitigation efforts in response to COVID-19 through July 31, 2020. Out of sincere commitment to and concern for our employees, their families and communities, we have not to date executed any pandemic-related reduction-in-force or furlough action plans.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Our goal is to be a desirable place to work, where everyone is inspired to be the best they can be and feels empowered to openly express opinions and ideas that help drive innovation. We will achieve our goal through our relentless commitment to create an inclusive and respectful culture across our family of companies. We are steadfast in our responsibility to embrace the diversity of all people and demonstrate our values – collaborative, dependable, proactive, empathetic and agile - with an unwavering focus on those essential to the Company achieving sustainable and meaningful growth. We have a long-standing commitment to equal employment opportunity ("EEO"), as evidenced by the Company’s EEO policy.
As part of our commitment to continued enhancements in this area, in 2020, we launched our Inclusion, Diversity, Equity Alliance ("IDEA"). This council is made up of employees from across multiple diversity dimensions, including by business, functional area, role, geography, gender, age and race. The council has established strategic objectives to strengthen the promotion of workplace diversity for our employees, to create a collaborative environment that promotes authenticity and a culture that celebrates differences, unique experiences and diverse perspectives. The Company's diversity, equity and inclusion strategy, supported by IDEA, will enhance company-wide engagement on diversity and inclusion, provide educational opportunities for our employees, help identify areas for improvement and monitor progress against these initiatives. 
Compensation and Benefits
We compensate employees with competitive wages and benefit programs designed to meet employee needs. Our compensation program is designed to recognize our employees' contributions to value creation and business results. We use a combination of fixed and variable pay including base salary, bonus, commissions and merit increases which vary across the Company. In addition, as part of our incentive plan for executives and certain employees, we provide share based compensation to attract, retain and motivate our key leaders. For further information concerning our equity incentive plans, see Note 9, Stock-based Compensation and Equity.
As the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people, our healthcare and benefit programs focus on three key pillars: physical, emotional, and financial well-being. We provide eligible employees with access to flexible and convenient healthcare programs intended to meet the needs of their families. We offer a wide array of benefits including comprehensive health and welfare insurances, a 401(K) plan with employer-match, generous time-off, paid maternity leave, identity theft insurance, and financial support. We provide emotional well-being services through our medical carrier and associated Employee Assistance Program. In addition, our financial education tools offer employees resources to reach their personal financial goals.
Development
Our goal is to create opportunities for employee growth, development, education and training, including opportunities to cultivate talent and identify candidates for new roles from within the Company. We strive to ensure that we have the right leaders in place to drive our strategic initiatives not only today but also into the future. We are committed to a safe workplace and an ethical environment in which employees are respected in a culture of belonging and dignity and in which they can continually develop their skills and expertise to advance their careers.
We also believe that ongoing performance feedback encourages greater engagement in our business and improved individual performance. Each year, our employees participate in our Performance Development Program that summarizes key accomplishments for the preceding year, establishes new goals, and identifies critical capabilities for development. We encourage managers to solicit and share supportive 360-degree feedback, further strengthening the focus on teamwork and team success.
Employee Recruitment
Our key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded a deep understanding among our employee base of our business, vision, products, services and clients, while adding new employees 
and ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset. As a direct result of the operational COVID-19 pandemic adjustments made to the organization during 2020, the opportunity became available to offer more work from home positions, whereas before, they would have been conducted from within an office space. Leveraging work collaboration tools and other technologies, the ability to hire remote employees has supported our efforts to grow our internal talent and welcome employees from diverse backgrounds and geographies, creating deeper team collaboration and a more engaging client experience. Our recruitment team uses internal and external resources to recruit diverse, highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions.
Communication and Engagement
Given the geographic diversity of our workforce, we use multiple modalities in our communication efforts. Our email and the employee hotline have been bolstered by the inclusion of all-employee texting and weekly all-employee communications. Other efforts include live teleconference all-employee meetings hosted by a variety of our leaders. Additionally, leaders participate in monthly business updates that facilitate awareness of business initiatives, progress and results. These meetings encourage cross-functional collaboration and help ensure that teams are not working in silos. These efforts have led to our ability to deliver a more consistent message across all of our constituencies and thereby improve engagement.
