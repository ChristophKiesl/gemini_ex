Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

​
Prior to January 17, 2023, we were known as Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. On September 28, 2022 we completed the Aceragen Acquisition, whereby we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Aceragen, Inc., a private company, as further described below. In connection with the Aceragen Acquisition and related transactions, we changed our name to Aceragen, Inc. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references in this section to the “Company,” “Aceragen,” “Idera,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar terms refer to Aceragen, Inc. (f/k/a Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and our consolidated subsidiaries. References to “Legacy Aceragen” refer to Aceragen, Inc. and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Aceragen Acquisition.
​
All share and per share amounts, including the exercise or conversion price of any of our securities, reflect, as applicable, the occurrence of a 1-for-17 reverse split of our common stock that occurred on January 17, 2023.
​
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a business strategy focused on the clinical development, and ultimately the commercialization, of drug candidates for rare disease indications characterized by small, well-defined patient populations with serious unmet medical needs. Our current focus is to develop and optimize commercial value of ACG-701 (patented formulation of sodium fusidate) and ACG-801 (recombinant human acid ceramidase (rhAC)) for appropriate patients. We have in the past and may in the future explore collaborative alliances to support development and commercialization of any of our drug candidates. We may also seek to identify and potentially acquire rights to novel development and commercial-stage rare disease programs through new business development opportunities, including additional strategic alternatives. 
As discussed in more detail below, in September 2022, we acquired Legacy Aceragen, a privately-held biotechnology company focused on addressing rare, orphan pulmonary, and rheumatic diseases for which there are limited or no available treatments. Legacy Aceragen owned or controlled the intellectual property related to ACG-701 (patented formulation of sodium fusidate) and ACG-801 (recombinant human acid ceramidase (rhAC)). Following the Aceragen Acquisition, our business strategy is to develop and optimize commercial value of ACG-701 and ACG-801 for appropriate patients. Accordingly, we are developing ACG-701 to treat cystic fibrosis (“CF”) pulmonary exacerbations (“PEx”) and melioidosis, a severe, life-threatening infection, and ACG-801 to treat patients suffering from a genetic mutation in the ASAH 1 gene, also known as Farber disease.
Until December 2021, we were developing tilsotolimod, via intratumoral injection, for the treatment of solid tumors in combination with nivolumab, an anti-PD1 antibody marketed as Opdivo® by Bristol Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”), and/or ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA4 antibody marketed as Yervoy® by BMS. Due to Phase 3 results in anti-PD-1 refractory advanced melanoma (ILLUMINATE-301), reported in March 2021, which showed the study failed to meet its primary endpoint, as well as a decision in December 2021 to discontinue enrollment in ILLUMINATE-206, our Phase 2 study in solid tumors, Company-sponsored development of tilsotolimod in oncology was discontinued. Although clinical trials with tilsotolimod have not yet translated into a new treatment alternative for patients, we believe that data supporting tilsotolimod’s mechanism of action and encouraging safety profile from across the array of pre-clinical and clinical work to date, together with its intellectual property protection, are noteworthy. 
​
Business Acquisition 
​
On September 28, 2022 (“Acquisition Date”), in accordance with the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), we acquired 100% of the outstanding security interests of Legacy Aceragen in a “stock-for-stock” transaction, whereby all Legacy Aceragen outstanding equity interests were exchanged for a combination of shares of our common stock, shares of Series Z preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Series Z Preferred Stock”), and shares of the newly-designated Series X non-voting preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Series X Preferred Stock”) (such acquisition, the “Aceragen Acquisition”). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Legacy Aceragen stockholders received (i) 451,608 shares of our common stock (inclusive of shares subject to repurchase), (ii) 80,656 shares of Series Z Preferred Stock (inclusive of shares subject to repurchase), and (iii) five shares of Series X Preferred Stock. In addition, all outstanding options and warrants to purchase 

1




Legacy Aceragen common stock were converted into stock options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and Series Z Preferred Stock on terms substantially identical to those in effect prior to the Aceragen Acquisition, except for adjustments to the underlying number of shares and the exercise price based on the Merger Agreement exchange ratio. 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we held a Special Meeting of Stockholders’ on January 12, 2023 (the “Special Meeting”) at which our stockholders approved, among other matters: (i) the conversion of Series Z Preferred Stock into shares of common stock in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(a) (the “Conversion Proposal”) and (ii) a proposal to amend our Charter to effect a reverse stock split of all of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split Proposal” and, together with the Conversion Proposal, the “Merger Agreement Meeting Proposals”). 
See “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Aceragen Acquisition and related transactions.
​
Recent Developments
​
On April 13, 2023, the Board approved certain cost-cutting measures with a view to preserving capital to support our continuing operations. As part of this plan, we have commenced the furlough of 12 employees, representing approximately 46% of our workforce. Additionally, certain of our employees and executive officers will defer portions of their respective base salaries in amounts that exceed $200,000, with such deferrals having a retroactive effective date of April 5, 2023. We will continue to review operations for other opportunities to reduce costs and pursue financing opportunities. For more information, please see Item 9B of this Form 10-K.
​
Clinical Development
​
Our Pipeline
​
We are developing ACG-701 to treat CF PEx and melioidosis, and ACG-801 to treat Farber disease, each of which is discussed in greater detail below.
​
ACG-701 (sodium fusidate)
​
ACG-701 for Cystic Fibrosis Pulmonary Exacerbations
ACG-701 is a proprietary oral, loading dose formulation of sodium fusidate being developed as a potential treatment for acute PEx associated with CF, a major factor driving lung function decline in people living with CF. 
CF is a progressive, genetic disease hallmarked by inflammatory and infectious pulmonary exacerbations that are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality for CF patients. PEx are a sudden worsening of respiratory symptoms caused by lung infections that often require intravenous (“IV”) antibiotic treatment. Current standard of care for acute PEx in CF is multifaceted, involving antibiotics, chest physiotherapy, inhaled medications to promote secretion clearance, and anti-inflammatory agents.
Sodium fusidate has an established clinical efficacy and safety profile from more than 50 years of use in other countries, including as part of CF PEx treatment guidelines in the United Kingdom and Australia. Despite this, the compound has never been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and represents a new and potentially powerful approach in the United States to address the infection, inflammation, and enhanced mucin expression that are hallmark features of CF PEx. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, in 2022, it was estimated that 105,000 patients have been diagnosed and were living with CF globally, with approximately 40,000 patients in the United States. If approved, ACG-701 would represent the first oral product in the United States indicated for the treatment of CF PEx. 
​
In December 2022, we initiated the REPRIEVE study (NCT05641298), a Phase 2 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study evaluating ACG-701 for the treatment of CF PEx (the “REPRIEVE Study”), which is being funded in part by $3.5 million in support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The REPRIEVE Study, which is 

2




expected to enroll 80 patients, will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ACG-701 plus optimized background therapy (OBT) compared to oral placebo plus OBT and capture multiple clinical events inclusive of patient-reported outcomes, FEV1, and antimicrobial regimen changes through day 14. The study opened for patient enrollment in March 2023 at clinical sites in the United States. Patients enrolled in the REPRIEVE Study will either be administered oral ACG-701 tablets twice a day for 14 days plus OBT or placebo tablets twice a day for 14 days plus OBT. The REPRIEVE Study will apply a desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) analysis to the results. Data from the REPRIEVE Study is expected in the first half of 2024.
ACG-701 has received Orphan Drug designations for the treatment of CF patients from the FDA. In addition, we have also received Fast Track and Qualified Infectious Disease Product (“QIDP”) designation for ACG-701 for the treatment of CF PEx. If approved, QIDP will provide an additional five-year extension of regulatory exclusivity to any exclusivities that the product may otherwise qualify.
ACG-701 for Melioidosis
ACG-701 is also being developed for the treatment of melioidosis, a life-threatening infection that can affect numerous organ systems, including the lungs. The pathogen that causes melioidosis, B. pseudomallei, is endemic in Southeast Asia and is classified as a Tier 1 biothreat agent by the U.S. government. The U.S. Department of Defense’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (“DTRA”) is supporting the development of ACG-701 as a potential medical countermeasure against this pathogen and has awarded us funding of up to $49.7 million, of which $30.0 million remains available as of December 31, 2022.
In May 2022, we initiated the TERRA study (NCT05105035), a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating ACG-701 for the treatment of melioidosis in hospitalized patients (the “TERRA Study”). The TERRA Study, which is actively recruiting and expected to enroll 125 patients, will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ACG-701 given in combination with IV ceftazidime or IV meropenem and capture multiple clinical events inclusive of mortality, organ failure, sepsis, and treatment modifications through day 14. Patients enrolled in the study will be administered either IV ceftazidime or IV meropenem per standard of care and either placebo or ACG-701 every 12 hours for days 1-14. Day 1 dosing consists of two doses of 1500mg ACG-701 administered 12 hours apart, and day 2-14 dosing consists of 600mg of ACG-701 administered every 12 hours.
An independent data monitoring committee (“iDMC”) is responsible for overseeing the safety and efficacy data. In February 2023, we announced that the iDMC for the TERRA Study met and recommended that the TERRA Study continue without modification. A data read-out from the TERRA Study is expected in the fourth quarter of 2023.
​
ACG-801 (acid ceramidase)
ACG-801 for Farber Disease
ACG-801, recombinant human acid ceramidase, is an investigational biological enzyme replacement therapy being developed for the treatment of Farber disease. Farber disease is a severe, progressive monogenic lysosomal storage disorder, involving mutations in the acid ceramidase gene that lead to toxic levels of ceramide accumulation. Acid ceramidase acts in the lysosome to metabolize ceramide, a pro-inflammatory lipid. Loss of acid ceramidase function leads to abnormal accumulation of ceramide, causing macrophage-driven inflammation and multi-organ disease affecting bone, cartilage, the immune system, central nervous system, and the lungs. Patients with the most severe phenotype of Farber disease die early in life, most commonly from respiratory failure. As of December 31, 2022, we estimated that worldwide prevalence of Farber disease exceeded 1,000 patients. We are not aware of any competitive development programs seeking to treat Farber disease and there are no Farber disease-specific treatments currently approved by the FDA.
We are planning a single, harmonized trial for regulatory submission for both FDA and European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) approval, known as the ADVANCE Study, which, as discussed in greater detail below, has been partially funded by NovaQuest (as defined below). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Farber disease patients, the ADVANCE study will measure nodule changes and capture patient-specific disease burden improvement through week 28. We have had regular interactions with the FDA, including a clinical-

3




focused Type C meeting in January 2023 to discuss trial design. Following resolution of the clinical hold placed on ACG-801 pertaining to manufacturing and quality issues, which we filed a response to in March 2023, we expect to initiate ADVANCE Study clinical activities in the first quarter of 2024.
The FDA has granted Orphan and Fast Track designations for ACG-801. The FDA has also designated ACG-801 as a product for rare pediatric diseases. If the ACG-801 marketing application is ultimately determined to meet the FDA’s criteria to be a rare pediatric disease application, ACG-801 may be eligible for a Rare Pediatric Disease priority review voucher provided that the marketing application is approved before the program sunsets. Additionally, ACG-801 was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the EMA for Farber disease.
Discontinued Programs
Tilsotolimod (IMO-2125) 
​
Tilsotolimod is a synthetic phosphorothioate oligonucleotide that acts as a direct agonist of TLR9 to stimulate the innate and adaptive immune systems. It was developed for administration via intratumoral injection in combination with systemically administered checkpoint inhibitors and costimulation therapies for the treatment of various solid tumors. We referred to our tilsotolimod development program as the ILLUMINATE development program. 
​
In the first quarter of 2018, we initiated a Phase 3 trial of intratumoral tilsotolimod in combination with ipilimumab in patients with anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma, which we referred to as ILLUMINATE-301. This trial compared the results of the tilsotolimod–ipilimumab combination to those of ipilimumab alone in a 1:1 randomization. The family of primary endpoints of the trial consisted of Objective Response Rate (“ORR”) by blinded independent central review RECIST v1.1 and median Overall Survival (“OS”). In March 2021, we reported that ILLUMINATE-301 did not meet its primary endpoint of ORR. In May 2021, following evaluation of the full data set, we announced we would not continue ILLUMINATE-301 to its OS primary endpoint.
​
In September 2019, we initiated a Phase 2, open-label, global, multicohort study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of tilsotolimod administered intratumorally in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab for the treatment of solid tumors, which we referred to as ILLUMINATE-206. The first solid tumor investigated under ILLUMINATE-206 was relapsed/refractory Microsatellite-Stable Colorectal Cancer (“MSS-CRC”) in immunotherapy-naïve patients (the “MSS-CRC Study”). In December 2021, based on an analysis of preliminary data from the safety cohort of ILLUMINATE-206, we announced that further enrollment in the trial had been discontinued. The decision to discontinue ILLUMINATE-206 was not related to safety concerns.
​
Following the announcement that all Company-sponsored development of tilsotolimod was discontinued in December 2021, all study-related activities concluded. 
​
Collaborative Alliances and Clinical Funding Arrangements
​
Our current collaborative alliances and clinical funding arrangements include agreements with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, DTRA (as defined below), and Scriptr Global, Inc. (“Scriptr”), each discussed further below. We may seek to enter into new funding arrangements or collaborative alliances to support development and commercialization of additional drug candidates.
​
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 
​
On December 13, 2021, Legacy Aceragen entered into a therapeutic development and award agreement (the “CFF Agreement”) with The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (“CFF”), pursuant to which CFF agreed to fund the REPRIEVE Study, as described above under the heading “Clinical Development,” in an amount up to $3.5 million (the “CFF Award”), of which $1.0 million had been received as of December 31, 2022. In consideration for the CFF Award and CFF’s license of CFF Know-How, Legacy Aceragen agreed to pay CFF royalties of up to $21.0 million as follows: (a) one-time royalty equal to 3x the CFF Award if a product resulting from the REPRIEVE Study is approved for commercial sale; (b) an amount equal to 1x the CFF Award in the event of a license transaction or change in control, as defined in the CFF Agreement; and (c) a one-time royalty equal to 1x the CFF

Upon receipt of a Data Package, we have, in our sole discretion, up to two-hundred seventy (270) calendar days to make effective the exclusive license agreement entered into by and between Scriptr and us, pursuant to which, among other things, Scriptr grants us exclusive rights and licenses with respect to the development, manufacture and commercialization of licensed candidates and products, subject to certain conditions and limitations (the “Scriptr License Agreement”), for a given Research Program (each licensed Research Program, a “Licensed Program”). The Scriptr License Agreement provides for customary development milestones on candidates developed under a Licensed Program and royalties on licensed products, if any.
​
In partial consideration of the rights granted by Scriptr to us under the Scriptr Agreement, we made a one-time, non-creditable, and non-refundable payment to Scriptr during the first quarter of 2021. In order to fund the Research Programs, we reimburse Scriptr for costs incurred by or on behalf of Scriptr in connection with the conduct of each Research Program during the research term in accordance with the applicable Research Program budget and payment schedule. We incurred $0.5 million and $2.1 million in research and development expenses under the Scriptr Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
​
Academic and Research Collaborations
We have entered into research collaborations with scientists at leading academic research institutions. These research collaborations allow us to augment our internal research capabilities and obtain access to specialized knowledge and expertise. In general, our research collaborations may require us to supply compounds and pay various amounts to support the research. Under these research agreements, if a collaborator, solely or jointly with us, creates any invention, we may own exclusively such invention, have an automatic paid-up, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, or have an option to negotiate an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to such invention. Inventions developed solely by our scientists in connection with research collaborations are owned exclusively by us. These collaborative agreements are non-exclusive and may be terminated with limited notice.

A second patent family includes a patent issued in Japan and a pending application in the U.S. that claims compositions of fusidic acid. The 20-year term for patents in this family runs through 2032, absent any available patent term adjustments. 
The status of our patent portfolios changes frequently in the ordinary course of our business. As of March 13, 2023, we owned or exclusively licensed approximately 10 U.S. patents and patent applications and about 111 patents and patent applications throughout the rest of the world that relate to our ACG-701 ad ACG-801 candidates.

TLR-targeted immune modulation technologies
​
Prior to the Aceragen Acquisition, we devoted a substantial amount of our resources into establishing intellectual property protection for:

● | novel chemical entities that function as agonists of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 or TLR9;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | novel chemical entities that function as antagonists of TLR7, TLR8 or TLR9; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | composition and use of our nucleic acid chemistry compounds to treat and prevent a variety of diseases.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of March 15, 2023, we owned approximately 44 U.S. patents and patent applications and about 177 patents and patent applications throughout the rest of the world for our TLR-targeted immune modulation technologies. These patents and patent applications include claims covering the chemical compositions of matter and methods of use of our IMO compounds, such as IMO-8400, IMO-9200 and tilsotolimod (IMO-2125), as well as other compounds. These patents and patent applications (if granted) expire at various dates ranging from 2023 to 2041. With respect to IMO-8400, we have ten issued U.S. patents that cover the chemical composition of matter of IMO-8400 and certain methods of its use, the latest of which expires in 2031. With respect to IMO-9200, we also have ten issued U.S. patents that cover the chemical composition for IMO-9200 and methods of its use, the latest of which expires in 2034. With respect to tilsotolimod, we have issued U.S. patents that cover the chemical composition of matter of tilsotolimod that will expire between 2023 and 2026, and we have additional U.S. patents that cover methods of its use, the latest of which will expire in 2037 assuming payment of all maintenance fees.
​
Because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, neither we nor our licensors can be certain that we or they were the first to make the inventions claimed in issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we or they were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications. 
​
Litigation may be necessary to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how owned by us, or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others or to determine the appropriate term for an issued patent. In addition, USPTO may declare interference proceedings to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications or reexamination or reissue proceedings to determine if the scope of a patent should be narrowed. Litigation or any of these other proceedings could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These efforts by us may not be successful. 
​
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent. A patent’s term may also be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug, biological product, or medical device approved pursuant to a pre-market approval may also be eligible for patent term extension when U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review and development. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”) permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date set for the patent. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be granted an extension and only those claims reading on the approved drug are extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug.
​
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology. Although trade secrets are difficult to protect, wherever possible, we use confidentiality agreements to protect the proprietary nature of our technology. We regularly implement confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and other contractors and collaborators. However, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets and/or proprietary information will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by 

9




competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
​
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our employees, collaborators, contractors and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and some of our collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party.
​
Competition
​
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We are currently developing ACG-701, a patented formulation of sodium fusidate, to treat CF PEx and melioidosis, and ACG-801, recombinant human acid ceramidase (rhAC), to treat patients suffering from Farber disease. We recognize that other companies, including large pharmaceutical companies, may be developing or have plans to develop products and technologies that may compete with our drug candidates, ACG-701 and ACG-801, or any other drug candidates we may develop or acquire in the future. Our products, if approved, will compete with novel therapies developed by biopharmaceutical companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions, in addition to standard of care treatments. Our competitors compete with us on the level of the technologies employed, or on the level of development of product candidates. In addition, many small biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to obtain support for their research, development, and commercialization of products that may potentially directly compete with our current or future product candidates. We anticipate that we will continue to face increasing competition as new therapies and combinations thereof, technologies, and data emerge for rare diseases which we are pursuing.

Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments, and the commercialization of those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance.
​
ACG-701 is currently being developed to treat patient suffering from CF PEx and melioidosis. We are aware of several companies that may compete with ACG-701 for the treatment of melioidosis, including, AN2 Therapeutics, Inc., Bugworks Research, Inc., Entasis Therapeutics, Inc., Soligenix, Inc., and Venatorx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. While there are currently no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of melioidosis, there are several antimicrobial drugs used off-label for the treatment of melioidosis, such as beta-lactams (e.g., ceftazidime, certain beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations), carbapenems, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and doxycycline, depending on the phase of treatment, with which our drug candidate may compete. While there are FDA-approved products for the treatment of CF and several companies developing therapies to address the underlying cause of CF, there are currently no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of CF PEx and, to the best of our knowledge, no company’s programs are currently aimed directly at addressing CF PEx. However, there may also be unexpected or unknown competitors that we are not presently aware of.
​
ACG-801 is being initially developed for the treatment of patients suffering from Farber disease, for which there is currently no approved therapies. While we are aware of several companies developing enzyme replacement therapies for other lysosomal storage diseases, to the best of our knowledge, no company’s programs are currently aimed directly at addressing Farber disease. However, there may be unexpected or unknown competitors of which we are not presently aware.
​
Our commercial potential for our current drug candidates, ACG-701 and ACG-801, or any other drug candidates or technologies we may acquire, could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, EMA, or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or make our development 

10




more complicated. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be efficacy, safety, and convenience. 

These competitors may also vie for a similar pool of qualified scientific and management talent, sites, and patient populations for clinical trials, as well as for technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our products. Further, our competitive position will also depend upon our ability to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes, protect our intellectual property, and to secure sufficient capital resources for the period between technological conception and commercial sales.
​
Manufacturing
​
We do not currently own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities for the production of preclinical, clinical, or commercial quantities of ACG-701 or ACG-801, or any other product candidate. We currently rely and expect to continue to rely on third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations (“CDMOs”) for all of our requirements of raw materials, drug substance, and drug product. We are not currently party to any long-term agreements with our current CDMOs. We intend to rely on CDMOs for clinical and commercial manufacturing of ACG-701 and ACG-801, as well as the clinical and commercial manufacturing of our other product candidates and any other product candidates that we may identify in the future. Although we rely on CDMOs, we have employees and third-party consultants with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our contract manufacturers.
​
Government Regulation
​
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing and sales, pricing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Regulatory requirements are also continually evolving. By example, the FDA and the EU regulatory authorities have also issued a growing body of guidance documents that provide the agency’s interpretation of regulatory requirements.
​
Review and Approval of Drugs and Biologics in the United States 
​
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and associated implementing regulations and guidance. In the United States, biologics are regulated under both the FDCA and the Public Health Services Act (“PHSA”). The failure to comply with the FDCA and other applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, operating restrictions such as the total or partial suspension of production or distribution, import bans, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) or other governmental entities, including state agencies. 
​
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug or biologic product in the United States must typically undertake the following: 

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (“GLP”) regulations and other applicable laws or regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (“IND”) application, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | initial and continuing approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11





● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCP”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application (“NDA”) for drug products or biologic license application (“BLA”) for biologic products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections or remote regulatory assessments of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the marketing application; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) where applicable, and post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Preclinical Studies and Submission of an IND 
​
Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, purity, and stability, among other attributes, of the manufactured drug or biologic substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug or biologic for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Additional preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
​
Human Clinical Studies in Support of a Marketing Application 
​
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Special clinical trial ethical considerations also must be taken into account if a study involves children. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. 
​
A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Under newly enacted legislation, diversity plans will also be required. Once an IND is in effect, unapproved product candidates may be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and the investigational product may be administered to humans as part of a clinical trial. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Depending on the conditions under development, multiple INDs may be required for the same product.
​
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol, protocol amendments, communications to study subjects and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information 

12




about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. Sponsors or distributors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious disease or conditions must also have a publicly available policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access. Investigators must also provide certain information to clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA.
​
Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data monitoring committee (“DMC”). This group provides recommendations as to whether a trial should move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
​
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
​
Phase 1:    The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease (e.g. cancer) or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and pharmacokinetics and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
​
Phase 2:    The product is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
​
Phase 3:    The product is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
​
In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA on the applicant’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm or refute the effectiveness of a product candidate, and can provide important safety information.
​
The manufacture of investigational products for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational products and active ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA. Further, the export of investigational products outside the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.
​
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and to the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA, the sponsor or the data monitoring committee for a clinical trial may suspend or terminate the clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect or conduct a remote regulatory assessment of one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
​
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 
​
NDAs for most new drug products are based on clinical studies conducted by or for the product sponsor. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an 

13




alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.” 
​
Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that was not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval or a similar product or that the applicant’s reliance on published data is scientifically appropriate, such as through bridging studies, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. Companies using this pathway, however, must conduct studies to support any differences from an approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
​
Submission of a Marketing Application to the FDA 
​
Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, for drug products, or BLA for biologic products, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to a substantial application user fee. The sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. Depending on the product and fee, a company may qualify for fee exceptions or waivers.
​
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA or BLA within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission of any filing review issues. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. 
​
The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) guidelines in the review process of NDAs and BLAs. Under PDUFA, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities (“NMEs”), are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which the FDA accepts the NDA or BLA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of products that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that the FDA receives the application. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
​
Before approving a marketing application, the FDA typically will inspect or conduct a remote regulatory assessment of the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections cover all facilities associated with a marketing application submission, including component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA,, the FDA will typically inspect or conduct a remote regulatory assessment of one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. 
​
In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can 

14




include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. The REMS strategy must be approved by the FDA. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy’s approval.
​
The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
​
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations 
​
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review or increased regulatory guidance if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation. 
​
Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s marketing application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the marketing application is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
​
In 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”). This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as “breakthrough therapies.” A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. Like fast track designation, breakthrough designation may be rescinded if the product no longer meets the qualifying criteria.
​
Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
​

Accelerated Approval Pathway 
​
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug or biologic for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”), and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
​
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product. 
​
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 
​
The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. By the date of approval of an accelerated approval product, FDA must specify the conditions for the required post approval studies, including enrollment targets, the study protocol, milestones, and target completion dates. The FDA may also require that the confirmatory Phase 4 studies be commenced prior to the FDA granting a product accelerate approval. Reports on the progress of the required Phase 4 confirmatory studies must be submitted to the FDA every 180 days after approval. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis through a statutorily defined streamlined process. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

The FDA’s Decision on Marketing Application 
​
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA or BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the marketing application, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
​
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including 

16




distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
​
Post-Approval Requirements 
​
Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences and production issues with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Many states also regulate the distribution of drug product samples and commercial product.
​
In addition, product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs and biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, are required to list their distributed products, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. The information that must be submitted to FDA regarding manufactured products was expanded through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) to include the volume of products produced during the prior year. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
​
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, or holds or termination of post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending marketing applications or supplements to approved marketing applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, product recalls, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, suspension and debarment from government contracts, refusal of orders under existing government contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, and adverse publicity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Sponsors are further subject to various requirements related to FDA product shortage and manufacturing volume reporting, supply chain security, such as risk management plan requirements, and the promotion of supply chain redundancy. FDA post-approval requirements are further continually evolving. For example, in March 2020, the U.S. Congress passed the CARES Act, which includes various provisions regarding FDA product shortage and manufacturing volume reporting requirements, as well as provisions regarding supply chain security, such as risk management plan requirements, and the promotion of supply chain redundancy and domestic manufacturing. The executive branch has also taken steps to promote domestic manufacturing, and the Consolidated Appropriations 

17




Act of 2023, and the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which were passed in 2022, included several changes to the FDC Act.
​
The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the product is approved. After approval, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. All statements must be consistent with the FDA-approved label, truthful, and non-misleading. Additionally, claims about product benefits and risks must be substantiated adequately while maintaining a fair balance between the two. For instance, it is impermissible to make claims about the superiority of our products over other treatments without sufficient evidence, which often requires head-to-head clinical studies for substantiation. In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe products for such uses not described in the product’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information.
​
If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes products. The federal government has levied large civil penalties and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
​
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”), and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”). The PDMA regulate and limit the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the federal level. The DSCSA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution, which requires certain licensing and licensing standards, and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.
​
Additional controls for biologics
​
In addition to the above requirements, biologic products are subject to additional controls and requirements. Biologic products are subject, not only to drug cGMPs, but also to a special set of manufacturing controls that are intended to ensure product quality. Due to risks involved with biologic products, FDA can immediately suspend licenses in situations where there is a danger to public health. FDA can also prepare or procure biologic products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs. After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval, meaning that the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests. Manufacturers subject to lot release may not release a biologic product for distribution until authorized by FDA. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
​
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs under abbreviated approval requirements. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the Reference Listed Drug (“RLD”).
​

18




Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, conditions of use, and the strength of the drug, among other requirements. Certain differences, however, between the reference listed drug and ANDA product may be permitted pursuant to a suitability petition. Certain labeling differences may also be permitted if information in the reference listed drug’s label is protected by patent or exclusivities. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.”
​
Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD, subject to state law requirements. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in automatic substitution of the generic drug at the pharmacy.
​
Hatch-Waxman Exclusivities
​
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity (“NCE”), is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt, or other noncovalent derivative, responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period prevents FDA from making a drug approval effective for the same changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication, as the product that holds the exclusivity. The three-year and five-year exclusivities, however, do not prevent the filing or approval of full NDAs.
​
Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
​
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to provide a certification to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. 
​
Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 

● | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


● | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use 

19




patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval). The applicant may also elect to submit a “Section VIII” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certifying to a listed method-of-use patent.
​
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders within certain specified timeframes. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
​
Biologic Exclusivity and Biosimilars
​
Under the Biologic Product Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), a product sponsor may apply to FDA for approval of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there is a high degree of similarity to the reference product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical trial, absent a waiver by the FDA. There must be no difference between the reference product and a biosimilar in mechanism of action, conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the FDA must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
If a biosimilar application is submitted to FDA, the biosimilar product sponsor and reference product sponsor may exchange certain patent and product information for the purpose of determining whether there should be a legal patent challenge. Based on the outcome of negotiations surrounding the exchanged information, the reference product sponsor may bring a patent infringement suit and injunction proceedings against the biosimilar product sponsor. The biosimilar applicant may also be able to bring an action for declaratory judgment concerning the patent.
Like the Hatch Waxman Act for small molecule drugs, the BPCIA provides for certain periods of regulatory exclusivity for biologic products. Specifically, a biosimilar product application may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product and the FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date of approval of the reference product. Not all biologic products, however, will qualify for exclusivity. For instance, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the 12 year exclusivity period. Biologic product exclusivity also does not block FDA approval of a full BLA for a competing product.
​
The FDA maintains a publicly-available online database of licensed biological products, which is commonly referred to as the “Purple Book.” The Purple Book lists product names, dates of licensure, and applicable periods of exclusivity. Further, the reference product sponsor must provide patent information and patent expiry dates to FDA following the exchange of patent information between biosimilar and reference product sponsors. This information is then published in the Purple Book.
FDA Efforts to Increase Competition
​
In an effort to increase competition in the drug and biologic product marketplace, Congress, the executive branch, and FDA have taken certain legislative and regulatory steps. For example, measures have been proposed and implemented to facilitate product importation. Moreover, the 2020 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act included provisions requiring that sponsors of approved drug products, including those subject to REMS, provide samples of the approved products to persons developing 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA drug products within specified timeframes, in sufficient quantities, and on commercially reasonable market-based terms. Failure to do so can 

20




subject the approved product sponsor to civil actions, penalties, and responsibility for attorney’s fees and costs of the civil action. This same bill also includes provisions with respect to shared and separate REMS programs for reference and generic drug products.
​
Pediatric Studies, Exclusivity, and Vouchers
​
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) of 2003, an NDA, BLA, or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the FDASIA in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
​
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the FFDCA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
​
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity and on listed patents. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the applicable time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or orange book listed patents that cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. 
​
As a further incentive to develop products for pediatric diseases, the FDCA established a program under which the FDA awards priority review vouchers to sponsors of rare pediatric disease products that meet certain criteria. The rare disease must be serious or life-threatening in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years. The product must contain no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) that has been previously approved in any other application and the application must meet certain additional qualifying criteria, including eligibility for FDA priority review. If FDA determines that a product is for a rare pediatric disease and the qualifying application criteria are met, FDA may award a priority review voucher. This voucher may be redeemed to receive priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. Use of a priority review voucher is subject to an FDA user fee. These vouchers are also transferable and may be bought and sold. Vouchers may also be revoked by FDA under certain circumstances and sponsors of approved rare pediatric disease products must submit certain reports to FDA. Changes to the FDCA, however, have limited future pediatric priority review vouchers. Under the law’s sunset provision, the drug or biologic must be designated by FDA for a rare pediatric disease no later than September 30, 2024, and approved no later than September 30, 2026, unless the law is reauthorized by Congress. 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
​
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug or biologic product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States). Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation if there is a product already approved by the FDA that that is considered by the FDA to be the same as the already approved product and is intended for the same indication. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan exclusivity. A company must request orphan product designation before submitting 

21




a marketing application. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from Prescription Drug User Fee Act fees.
​
If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
​
Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product is deemed to be the same as the product with exclusivity and for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. 
​
Presently, the exact scope of orphan drug exclusivity is currently in flux. In 2021, the scope of orphan product exclusivity for the drug Firdapse was the subject of a legal challenge and reversal in the Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra judicial decision. The court ruled that the orphan drug exclusivity for Firdapse prevented another company’s application for the same drug from being approved for the entire disease or condition for which orphan drug designation was granted, despite the fact that the approved product indication was narrower. This decision differed from the FDA’s interpretation of the FDCA, which held that orphan drug exclusivity only protected a product’s approved indication. In January 2023, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register indicating that it interprets the Catalyst Pharms. decision narrowly and plans to continue limiting the scope of orphan drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved. The scope of orphan drug exclusivity will likely be an evolving area.
​
Qualified Infectious Disease Products
​
For certain infectious disease products, the FDCA provides further development incentives through additional periods of regulatory exclusivity. Specifically, qualified infectious disease products (QIDPs) are eligible for the extension of existing periods of regulatory exclusivities by an additional five years. This exclusivity extension is subject to certain statutory limits. A QIDP is an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens; or qualifying pathogens designated by the FDA. Sponsors must request, any time before submitting an NDA, that the FDA designate the product as a QIDP. QIDP designation may be withdrawn if FDA finds that the request for designation contained an untrue statement of material fact.
​
Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
​
A patent claiming a new drug or biologic product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a marketing application, plus the time between the submission date of a marketing application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs or biologics for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
​

Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
​
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
​
Clinical Trial Approval in the EU
​
Pursuant to the previous European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union (“EU”) has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant obtained approval from the competent national authority of a EU member state in which the clinical trial was conducted. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (which came fully into force from January 2022), which will be directly applicable to and binding without the need for any national implementing legislation. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a multi-state clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU member state or in more than one EU member state. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials. The applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial applications must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the applicable EU legislation and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
​
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the European Union
​
Regulation 141/2000 provides that a drug shall be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating, or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
​
Regulation 847/2000 sets out criteria and procedures governing designation of orphan drugs in the EU. Specifically, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of “clinically relevant superiority” by a similar medicinal product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs pursuant to Regulation 141/2000 shall be eligible for other incentives made available by the EU and by the EU member states to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs.
​

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
​
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, and imposing controls to manage costs. Our rebate payments may increase, or our prices be adjusted under value-based purchasing arrangements based on evidence-based measures or outcomes-based measures for a patient or beneficiary based on use of our drug. Third-party payors may also limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication or may impose other market access or utilization management controls. 
​
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
​
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, increases in rebates paid, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies, or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other EU member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements. 
​
Healthcare Law and Regulation 
​
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval.

​
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Healthcare Reform in the United States
​
A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last several years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and 

25




biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States.
​
By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”) which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Moreover, in 2017, the U.S. Congress modified and amended certain provisions of the PPACA, which could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by the federal and state healthcare programs as well as plans in the private health insurance market. The so-called “individual mandate” was repealed as part of tax reform legislation adopted in December 2017. Legal challenges to the PPACA may continue to arise and there may continue to be future efforts to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The Biden administration is expected to continue to take measures to further facilitate the implementation of the PPACA. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to potential drug candidates are:

● | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures, or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price” (“AMP”) for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | established the Independent Payment Advisory Board (“IPAB”) which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs, subsequently repealed through the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, led to aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that started in 2013 , were paused from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, and will continue through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and

otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. 
​
More recently, Congress amended the Medicaid statute, effective October 1, 2019, to exclude prices paid by secondary manufacturers for an authorized generic drug (but not a product approved under the BLA process) from the NDA holder’s AMP for the brand, thereby increasing the rebate amount and the 340B price for the brand. This was implemented by CMS in a final rule issued December 31, 2020. The rule also expanded the definition of products identified as “line extensions” and, in certain circumstances, required inclusion of patient copay assistance in Medicaid best price (effective January 1, 2023), thereby potentially increasing Medicaid rebates paid by manufacturers for such drugs. 340B program guidance regulations on civil monetary penalties for statutory violations, which had been finalized in early 2017 but deferred, also recently went into effect. On November 27, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing a Most Favored Nation payment model under which reimbursement for certain Medicare Part B drugs and biologicals will be based on a price that reflects the lowest per capita Gross Domestic Product-adjusted (GDP-adjusted) price of any non-U.S. member country of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with a GDP per capita that is at least sixty percent of the U.S. GDP per capita. This rule now has been rescinded, but similar programs have been described in recent legislative proposals. 
​
These healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, payment of increased rebates, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices or the frequency with which products are prescribed or administered. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Since enactment of the PPACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. 
​
Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the recent administrations have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.
