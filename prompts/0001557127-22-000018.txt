Item 1. Business
Overview
Our mission is to empower every organization with the breakthrough perspectives they need to deliver truly exceptional customer experiences using human insight.
We have pioneered a video-first, enterprise-grade SaaS platform that enables organizations to see and hear the experiences of real people as they engage with products, designs, apps, processes, concepts, or brands. Our platform captures authentic, credible, and highly contextualized customer perspectives from targeted audiences who have opted in to share their thoughts, whether for digital, real-world, or omnichannel experiences. Using machine learning, our platform analyzes these perspectives and surfaces key moments of insight rapidly and at scale. This helps organizations to free up time and resources and make better customer experience decisions faster using the power of video to drive alignment and action.
As the world and consumer behavior change, companies are increasingly differentiating themselves based on their ability to deliver the best experiences for their customers. Organizations are spending billions of dollars to understand their customers through data. Despite all these investments, there is still a significant gap between an organization’s perception of its customer-centricity and its customers’ perceptions of their experiences. This divide, or “empathy gap,” has a direct impact on the end customer and often leads to poor customer experiences. 
To deeply understand what it is actually like to be a customer, organizations need to continuously engage with, listen to, and observe their customers directly. Consumers are accustomed to sharing their thoughts and perspectives through video and online channels. Customer experience solutions must help organizations tap into the rise of this video-first culture to develop a closer connection with their customers and build a deeper understanding that is missing from the data trend lines, charts, and graphs that many organizations rely on today. By understanding customers and their perspectives better, organizations can create better customer experiences that stimulate growth, drive loyalty, and expand market share.
The power of the UserTesting Human Insight Platform is our ability to capture and analyze Customer Experience Narratives (CxNs). CxNs are digitally recorded video narratives from targeted, opt-in audiences from our unique UserTesting Contributor Network or an organization’s own network. These video-based recordings capture the perspectives and experiences of these audiences in narrative form. Our technology enables our contributors or customers of an organization to record their screen or actions on camera as they consider and engage with products, designs, processes, concepts, or brands. As a result, we capture a broad array of human signals needed to truly understand a human experience, including: intonation and tone of voice, facial expressions, body language, visuals, and actions (both digital and real world), all overlaid with a person’s thoughts spoken out loud as they go through an experience. This rich and immersive format enables organizations to see the experiences that they have designed, created, and delivered through their customers’ eyes. 
Organizations use our platform to surface and manage human insight, collaborate with others, and share these insights among teams. We believe experience narratives are a more powerful catalyst than any data set for aligning teams and motivating people to act, and that developing a shared understanding of customers through human insight is mission critical for organizations to drive better decisions that create and deliver exceptional customer experiences. 
Organizations derive value from our platform in many ways, across a variety of use cases and functional teams. Digital teams use our platform to improve their customers’ browsing and purchasing experience across channels. Product teams use our platform to vet new market opportunities and understand product-market-fit and customer needs, throughout the entire product creation process from concept to post-launch. Marketing teams leverage our platform to get reactions and diverse perspectives on their brand messaging, marketing campaigns, landing pages, product naming, and pricing to ensure that they resonate. Research and design teams run studies on our platform to understand changing customer behavior, test new designs and prototypes, and find usability concerns. And customer experience teams use our platform to better understand the full customer journey and customer expectations while interacting with different parts of the business. Beyond these use cases, many teams use our platform to benchmark their customer experiences against their competitors.
Our platform is architected to be video-first, easy-to-use, and quick to return insights (typically in less than a day and often within a few hours) – all on a secure, enterprise-grade, and highly scalable foundation. We have built sophisticated technology to capture video and other rich data streams from computers, tablets, and smartphones, for a range of experiences including web, mobile, real world, and omnichannel. We provide easy-to-use templates and a template builder that our customers use to define the set of questions they want to ask and tasks they want a person to do within an 
5


experience. We leverage our industry-leading, purpose-built network of contributors to provide organizations authentic, credible, and highly contextualized customer perspectives on those experiences. Since our founding, we have steadily built up our network of contributors and have qualified over 600,000 contributors in that time. The quality of the UserTesting Contributor Network and speed with which our platform delivers results keeps teams on our platform engaged to run more experience tests and attracts new teams to the platform. Our platform handles four streams of data: screen or real world recordings through video; voice through audio; facial expressions through video; and digital interactions through clickstream data for digital properties. The volume and richness of these data sources, along with audience profile, question, and task data, enable us to develop several proprietary machine-learning models that we use for audience targeting and distribution, and for rapid analysis to surface key moments of insight from the perspectives we capture.
Our go-to-market model is based on a direct sales force that is optimized for the size and geography of a customer’s organization. We have also started investing in creating channel partnerships and relationships with resellers, distributors, and strategic partners to broaden our reach. As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 2,300 customers, including more than half of the world’s top 100 most valuable brands according to Forbes, and over 300 large customers with at least $100,000 of ARR.
We have achieved significant growth in recent periods. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 our total revenue was $147.4 million, $102.2 million, and $76.6 million, respectively, representing period-over-period growth of 44% and 33%, respectively. As we have grown our business, we have made significant investments in sales and marketing and research and development. As a result, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our net loss was $50.7 million, $34.0 million, and $19.6 million, respectively.
The UserTesting Human Insight Platform
UserTesting is transforming how today’s organizations understand what it is actually like to be a customer and build exceptional experiences for their customers. 
How Our Platform Works
Target Diverse Customer Perspectives – Select the experience to be tested, either by uploading a digital file, linking to an app or web page, or providing instructions to take a real-world action. The platform helps to structure a series of questions or requests to perform tasks, and then finds a matching set of contributors in one of the networks. If using the UserTesting Contributor Network, the platform can be used to define a target audience, using predefined and custom filters. It then automatically targets contributors based on defined criteria.
Generate CxNs – Matched contributors log into our platform to complete the experience test, answer questions, and perform tasks, while they narrate their thoughts out loud. Each experience is fully recorded and the platform generates a series of experience narratives representing the diverse perspectives of each contributor in a rich and immersive format that includes screen activity, actions captured by camera, voice, and facial expressions. CxNs are delivered typically in less than a day and often within a few hours, enabling organizations to integrate human insight into their everyday operations.
Discover & Share Human Insight – Organizations watch experience narratives using our embedded video player. The platform offers several tools, such as transcripts, tagging, and video clips, to quickly find insights. Additionally, the platform also automatically suggests insights based on machine learning. Powerful visualizations of CxN data surface interesting insights and help organizations get to the moments that matter faster. Because of the persuasive video-first format, key moments and learnings are often shared in email, presentations, or in various channels to drive empathy and a shared understanding of the customer, along with more urgency and action.
Use Cases
Organizations use the UserTesting Human Insight Platform across many teams, such as digital, product, marketing, research and design, and customer experience teams. Many organizations also use our platform to gain critical competitive intelligence by watching different target audiences compare their offerings against those of their competitors. As we see 
6


more teams and use cases emerge within an organization, we have observed our platform expand into customers’ human resources, customer support, IT, training, and operations teams.
Key Benefits of Our Platform
Capturing Authentic, Credible, and Highly Contextualized Video-first Customer Perspectives 
We capture and collect highly contextualized video narratives of a customer experience. These narratives provide unique and rich foundational information for surfacing key moments of insight and enable the viewer to have a first-person understanding of the customer and the customer’s experience. Our CxN capture technology handles four streams of data from each video and multiple human signals, all combined with audience and test plan data. From this richer and more engaging format, which can be used for both digital and real world experiences, organizations receive authentic, credible, and highly contextualized perspectives and insights from their customers that provide the depth and context necessary to improve customer experience and differentiate their position from competitors.
Delivering Customer Perspectives at Rapid Speed and at Scale to Support the Quick Iterative Process of Today’s Organizations
Our platform enables organizations to collect diverse customer perspectives at the speed and scale necessary to keep pace with the iterative and rapid workflows of today’s business environment. Our software technology allows organizations to create and distribute experience tests to their desired audiences and get results typically in less than a day and often within a few hours.
Target and Find the Most Relevant Audience to Provide their Perspectives 
Organizations can quickly define and find their target audience on the platform – whether utilizing the UserTesting Contributor Network, using their existing networks or database of contacts, or in any network they can reach with a hyperlink. Our platform enables finding a specific target audience using any combination of demographic and other custom filters, device type preferences, language requirements, and flexible screening questions. Unlike other customer experience tools, where the customer may not be aware they are being tracked, contributors on our platform must first opt-in. Our approach gives organizations better certainty that they can quickly find their desired audience who will share high-quality and unique perspectives, and who want to participate and help shape better experiences.
Analyzing and Surfacing Key Moments of Insight in an Easy to Understand and Actionable Form
Our platform uses analytics and machine learning to detect customer intent and sentiment to quickly pinpoint moments that matter within these video-based recordings. At the same time, we deliver those moments of insight in a powerful and quickly consumable video clip format that better conveys the full set of important human signals that build a deeper understanding of the customer experience, driving stronger alignment and urgency to act.
Freeing Up Time and Resources for Organizations
Our platform saves our customers significant time that would have been spent in more manual processes such as test creation, recruiting participants, scheduling customer interviews, managing participant data, and reviewing interview videos to pinpoint the important moments of insight. Traditional outsourced focus groups or in-house labs usually take weeks or months to run a customer experience study, but our platform can deliver results and insights typically in less than a day and often within a few hours. As organizations become more agile and need to make a greater number of decisions to deliver their services, our platform also saves them money by lowering the incremental costs to learn directly from diverse customer perspectives.
Democratizing Access to Customer Perspectives – Making It Easy for Anyone to Make Decisions Based on Human Insight
Our platform is easy to use, making it accessible to a broad range of business users beyond traditional market researchers, user experience researchers, and other experts. Customer experience is a matter of organization-wide strategic importance, and we make it easy for anyone in an organization to reach their target audience and get a deeper understanding of their customers.
Providing an Enterprise-Grade Platform with Integrations into Business Operations and Workflows
Our platform has been architected to support the needs of today’s enterprises, and includes state-of-the-art encryption and identity management capabilities to ensure the security and privacy of customer data. We also offer extended features 
7


for customer experience experts who need more comprehensive capabilities. Finally, we are continually growing our ecosystem, with integrations into common business applications, such as Adobe XD, Qualtrics, Slack, Jira, and Trello, and we are building out open application programming interfaces (APIs) that promote seamless collaboration and sharing of insights.
Our Growth Strategies
Acquiring New Customers
We believe that understanding and improving customer experiences through human insight represents a broad and underpenetrated market opportunity. We will continue to invest aggressively in sales and marketing to continue to acquire new customers, and our go-to-market model is built in a scalable way to support new customer growth of all sizes.
Expanding Within Existing Customers Across Core and New Functional Teams
We are focused on driving value, additional adoption, and growth within these customers using our land-and-expand model. Our platform’s use cases are continuing to expand as customers continue to see value from human insight, which drives adoption across multiple teams.
Continuing to Grow Internationally
To further our international strategy and focus, we have sales offices in Edinburgh, Scotland covering the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region and Singapore covering the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. In 2021, approximately 18% of our total revenue came from customers outside the United States. International revenue increased approximately 76% compared to the prior year period. We believe international expansion will be a key growth driver for our business.
Innovating and Expanding Our Platform
We have a strong history of innovation and have pioneered a video-first, enterprise-grade platform that enables organizations to see and hear the experiences of real people as they engage with products, designs, apps, processes, concepts, or brands. We intend to continue to invest in new features and functionality, extending the platform to a broader range of enterprises, geographies, users and use cases.
Deepening Our Network of Channel Partnerships
We are in the early phases of building out our UserTesting partners and reseller program. Our focus areas include working with agencies, systems integrators, and resellers. All of these channels will enable us to achieve go-to-market leverage as we scale, supporting our continued growth.
Our Platform and Capabilities
The UserTesting Human Insight Platform offers organizations a unique and differentiated way to get access to a vivid first-person understanding of a customer’s experience and perspectives. The platform helps to systematically bring experience creators and decision makers closer to their customers as they build new products, services, apps, and brands that are changing the world. 
The platform delivers these perspectives and experiences of real people through our video-first Customer Experience Narratives and helps to quickly surface key moments of human insight. Key components of the platform include:
•CxN Core. The core is powered by three engines that help organizations create Customer Experience Narratives or CxNs: the Capture and Live Streaming Engine, the Test Plan Engine, and the Distribution Engine.
•CxN Audience Management. This helps organizations quickly define and find their target audience on the platform – whether in the UserTesting Contributor Network, a customer’s existing network or database of contacts (such as loyalty program members or frequent users), or in any network they can reach with a hyperlink.
•Human Insight Management. There are four main components of Human Insight Management that help organizations analyze CxNs generated through the platform, surface insights quickly, collaborate with teams, and share insights across an organization to inspire action and drive urgency: Analytics and Visualizations, Intelligent Insights, Collaboration and Workspaces, and Sharing.
•Data and Machine Learning. The foundation of our platform is built using a powerful data and machine learning layer. The platform stores all our audience data, test plan data, application data, and an extensive CxN dataset. 
8


This data set is continually enriched and the many features across the platform built on top of these machine learning models, such as the intelligent insights, are continuously validated and corrected. These self-training models build continuous learning directly into the platform, making the platform itself more intelligent and better over time.
•Privacy, Security and Compliance. We offer capabilities to help the platform better scale across thousands of users, become embedded within organizations’ business processes, and help organizations comply with applicable security, privacy, and compliance requirements.
•APIs and Integrations. Using APIs, we can initiate a templatized test launch and extract results in the form of video clips. We use our APIs to build specific integrations to popular partner and third-party business apps, giving customers turn-key integrations that promote seamless test creation (e.g., through Adobe XD) and sharing of CxN clips (e.g., through tools like Slack, Jira, and Trello).
Our Technology
Our technology and infrastructure enable us to build and continuously innovate on our Human Insight Platform. We designed our platform to be video-first because we anticipated that it would be the most important and demanding of the available sources – the keystone to handling all of our anticipated data streams. Video requires expertise in encoding, decoding, multiplexing, and synchronization, and poses challenges related to bandwidth and network performance to a much higher degree than other forms of communication like voice, chat, and content sharing. Several years ago we started adding additional streams of data, such as the clickstream to complement video, enabling the platform to deliver a richer multiple stream format, the CxN.
Our experience with multiple streams and types of data is particularly important. Other approaches to customer experience insight focus on a single source, such as facial expressions in video, sentiment in audio, and behavior in a clickstream. While these are all interesting in isolation, the combination is significantly more valuable than any one of them alone. Combining, analyzing, and managing them in the aggregate is how our technology platform enables our customers to gain deeper insight from a CxN than they get from other solutions. Our platform is cloud-native and provides customers with the reliability, scalability, and security they expect and need.
The Key Tenets of Our Technology Platform:
•General and Special Purpose Data Stores. Efficient data storage is fundamental to our ability to use the vast amounts of data we collect every day. We combine relational databases, NoSQL databases, file stores, and a graph database to optimize query speed, scalability, and reliability. To meet our customers’ need for local storage, we also store data across multiple availability zones and across regions.
•Data Access, Data Visualization, Video Processing, and Data Processing. We use highly scalable microservices to process video and data. REST and GraphQL APIs expose data in optimized formats as well as advanced algorithms implemented in the video and data processing layer, which includes live streaming of dual video channels, an audio channel, and bi-directional data channels from/to each connected endpoint.
•Machine Learning Model Development and Execution. We combine human analysis with machine learning (ML) enabled analysis to gain deep insights from CxNs. Our technology platform includes a fully integrated development environment to build, train, and deploy ML models, allowing us to rapidly innovate and bring new capabilities into the Human Insight Platform.
•CxN Capture Technology. Our capture technology works across many device types, using browser plugins, self-loading scripts, and apps as appropriate. This allows us to capture all aspects of a customer’s perspective and is optimized for web and mobile app experiences to enable a smooth CxN creation process. Depending on the use case, we can stream all data to our servers or we can record locally and later upload the recordings to our servers for further processing.
Proprietary Machine Learning Models
The volume and richness of our dataset has also enabled us to develop several proprietary machine learning models based on one or more of the CxN data sources, including:
•Natural Language Processing based on transcribed CxN audio to identify positive and negative sentiment, identify reactions such as confusion, and finding questions and their answers in a CxN.
9


•Image-based Models to identify icons and to group path flows based on the layout of pages and screens, enabling deeper analysis of contributor interactions with webpages or application interfaces. 
•Audio-based Models to rate the quality of a CxN based on volume, tone, inflection, and other factors.
•Demographic and Behavior-based Models based on contributors’ CxNs to maintain optimal level of engagement of our contributors.
•Multi-source Models to identify intent in a CxN and to recognize indicators of engagement within a CxN, including joy and excitement as well as frustration and disengagement. 
The nature of the Human Insight Platform and how our customers use it is a unique source of training data for many of our machine learning models. Customers interact with CxNs in many ways, such as commenting, tagging, making clips, and rating CxNs. Each interaction helps label the data set, creating valuable training data on discrete elements within an experience narrative as well as overall quality. We can also leverage the multiple data sets within each CxN to further refine our ML algorithms by using the data sets to label each other. For instance, we use voice data to identify a contributor’s mood changes during a CxN, then use that information to train the clickstream algorithm to recognize how these mood changes reflect in cursor movements and clicks of the same CxN. The insights gained from our machine learning models encourage customers to engage with and expand usage of our Human Insight Platform, compounding growth in the volume of training data available to our models.
Organizations harness the power of our ML models through our proprietary visualizations that make it easier for them to identify and focus on the most relevant sections of a CxN. For instance, our sentiment and intent ML models automatically generate tags that are used in our platform in combination with multiple CxN data streams to create a single visual output. The aggregated flow of many experience narratives can be explored in a single interactive graph that shows common and divergent experiences of a set of contributors completing the same set of tasks. Overlays of sentiment and intent analysis can then identify critical moments in each CxN where an organization may want to focus attention.
We believe our technology sets us apart through our unique ability to control everything from capture through analysis to visualization. We have innovated on capture based on needs arising from analysis or visualization, and captured data has led us to innovations in analysis and visualization. While we can ingest video and audio from almost any source and analyze it, it is the unique CxN, multiple-stream format that enables us to do the deepest analysis and that enables the most powerful visualizations. The technology platform and the access to an ever-growing set of training data let us innovate and deliver value to our customers rapidly.
Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our platform, develop new features, and improve our infrastructure. Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, architecture, testing, and quality of our platform, and we focus our efforts on developing our core technologies and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance, and flexibility of our platform.
Professional Services
Our professional services team provides our customers with a broad range of services, including delivering research studies, training services, and strategy workshops, to help them realize the full benefits of the UserTesting platform. Our customers also have access to both on-demand and live educational courses through our online programs. Our service offerings range from hourly guidance projects to ongoing research and program management engagements, to meet the varying needs of our wide-ranging customer base.
Our Employees and Human Capital
UserTesting has a unique company culture that is a critical component to the success of our customers and ultimately the success of the business. Our core values represent our shared beliefs and show who we strive to be as a company. They are Get Better, Drive Results, Customers First, Be Kind and Keep it Simple (BRiCKS). Our values are what define and preserve our culture as we continue to build a great company – brick by brick. 
As a company, we share many of the same traits as our customers who tend to be curious people who value empathy, human insight, diversity, experimentation, and iterative learning. We believe that there needs to be more empathy in business and in relationships with employees, customers, partners, and stakeholders. When people are exposed to different perspectives and can better understand their motivations – it is easier to solve problems, create new solutions, communicate 
10


in terms that resonate, and build trust with diverse audiences. This culture and our shared set of beliefs is key to attracting and retaining the best talent.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 783 employees, including 191 in research and development, 360 in sales and marketing, and 77 in general and administrative. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are a party to a collective bargaining arrangement and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We work to identify, attract, and retain employees who are aligned with and will help us progress towards our mission, and we seek to provide competitive cash and equity compensation.
We are committed to creating and supporting an inclusive environment that promotes and encourages diversity, belonging, wellness, and career development. This commitment extends to all aspects of our relationships with our team members, including in the hiring and promotion process, training, compensation, benefits, and career development.
Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Belonging
We seek employees who bring diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences to our culture, and who reflect our diverse society.
We track and report our key human capital metrics, including our workforce demographics, diversity data, and employee turnover and regularly share these figures with the compensation committee of our board of directors. In 2021, we continued towards our goal of achieving parity in representation for women on our worldwide team, by achieving 46% representation of women as of December 31, 2021.
We know there is still more that we need to do to cultivate our talented workforce and continue to foster trust. We use a variety of channels to facilitate open and direct communication, including open forums with executives, employee experience surveys, and engagement through various employee resource groups, including the Women@, Black@, LGBTQIA@, Latinx@ and many others. 
Commitment to Pay Equity
We conduct periodic third-party audits of team members’ salary to confirm that our employees are paid equitably for their work, regardless of race or ethnicity, gender, or other characteristics not relevant to their role or performance in it. If an audit reveals statistically significant differences that cannot be explained by legitimate business factors for team members who hold similar positions, we address these issues directly. In 2021, we assessed our pay programs by working with external consultants to evaluate our U.S., UK and Canada salaries. That assessment found that our top drivers of pay are what we believe are the right factors: job, location, and level.
Our Commitment to ESG
Community Involvement
We drive social good through our commitment to corporate citizenship in the communities in which we operate. In 2021, we became a member of the Pledge 1% movement and are currently committed to donate volunteer hours and use of our platform to support underserved communities. We encourage our employees to volunteer their time to the community by providing eight hours of paid time off every quarter for volunteering activities, which translates into the ability of our team to donate thousands of volunteer hours a year. Additionally, in 2019 and 2020, we and our employees donated more than $80,000 in employee and corporate donations to these efforts.
Sustainability and Global Impact
As a technology company, we have implemented several initiatives relating to the sustainable use of resources, including implementing technological tools, encouraging our employees to recycle and compost when in office, offering reusable dishware and utensils, providing filtered water dispensers to discourage consumption of bottled water in most of our breakrooms, and disposing of old computers and other electronic equipment with an electronic waste vendor so that such equipment is responsibly recycled, repurposed, or donated. In addition, our internal sustainability resource group helps drive employee-led environmental sustainability efforts.
Business Ethics, Integrity, and Governance
From our board of directors to every team member, the work we do each day is guided by a robust commitment to our business ethics and integrity program. We encourage everyone to do the right thing. Integrity is embedded in our culture 
11


and something we promote from the top down and throughout our business. Through our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and related policies, we promote responsible, safe, and transparent interactions between our employees, contributors, and customers.
Our Customers
As of December 31, 2021, we had over 2,300 customers of all sizes globally across a variety of industries including more than half of the world’s top 100 most valuable brands according to Forbes. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 82%, 85% and 91%, respectively, of our revenue was generated from customers located in the United States. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing teams work closely together to help new customers discover, try, adopt, and expand usage of UserTesting over time. We include customer success, renewals management, and a single revenue operations and strategy team under the sales organization to align these efforts to best support our customers.
The sales organization is responsible for driving new customer opportunities and customer expansion and growth through cross-sell and up-sell opportunities. Our primary sales channel is through a direct sales force that is optimized for the size and geography of a customer’s organization from small to medium businesses to enterprise customers. Our customer success and renewal organizations complement our sales teams by consulting with our customers to help grow adoption, realize the value and impact of our platform, drive subscription renewals, and expand to new users and use cases. 
The marketing organization is responsible for building awareness in the market, generating demand and preference for the brand, and creating experiences and programs to drive customer engagement, adoption, and customer advocacy. We leverage strong inbound demand through our website to generate leads and use content marketing, search marketing, influencer marketing, and other techniques to increase traffic to our website. We extend our reach through online advertising, over-the-top-TV (OTTV) and out of home advertising, virtual and in-person events, partner marketing, content syndication, and account-based marketing. We view our customer conferences as playing a key role in providing current and future customers and thought leaders in the industry with an understanding of our platform through interactions with peers, UserTesting University training and certifications, and by highlighting customer use cases and best practices.
Seasonality
We generally experience seasonality in billings with our customers, and we typically record a higher percentage of billings in our fourth quarter, as we have historically executed many of our contracts in the fourth quarter due to the calendar year-ends and procurement cycles of our customers.
Our Competition
The market for customer experience software solutions is large and rapidly evolving and covers many segments. Our primary competition are manual internal processes that companies use to get customer feedback, which frequently involve using a variety of different tools that are not purpose-built for obtaining customer insight, including video conference call technology to enable conversations and productivity tools to manually capture insights from conversations and share with others in the organization. Certain features of our platform compete with existing products and services within the overall customer experience market. Providers of those products and services fall within the following categories:
•Online sentiment and survey companies, such as Qualtrics, Medallia, and Momentive (formerly SurveyMonkey);
•Product analytics companies, such as Pendo and Amplitude;
•Marketing analytics companies, such as Google Analytics;
•Point solution vendors offering usability research tools;
•Research services firms, such as Kantar; and
•Panel aggregators, such as Cint and Lucid.
12


Larger software vendors with substantial resources and smaller, early stage companies building on new technology platforms may also decide to enter our market by building or acquiring products that compete with our platform. 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
•Speed in delivering quality results at scale;
•Customer experience, including ease of deployment and use;
•Expansion of use cases;
•Features, functionality, and quality;
•Brand awareness and reputation;
•Quality and depth of audience feedback;
•Privacy and security;
•Accessibility across multiple devices;
•Strength of sales and marketing efforts; and
•Pricing. 
We believe we compete favorably across these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance in use case expansion and delivery of fast, high-quality insights. Moreover, because our market is new and rapidly developing, it is possible that new entrants, especially those with substantial resources, more efficient operating models, more rapid technology and content development cycles or lower marketing costs, could introduce new products and services that disrupt our market and better address the needs of our customers and potential customers. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more comprehensive description of risks related to competition.
Government Regulation
We are subject to many varying laws and regulations in the United States and throughout the world, including those related to data privacy, security and protection, intellectual property, worker classification, employment and labor, workplace safety, consumer protection, anti-bribery, import and export controls, immigration, federal securities and tax
Moreover, new and existing laws and regulations (or changes in interpretation of existing laws and regulations) may also be adopted, implemented, or interpreted to apply to us or our contributors, and uncertainty around the application of these laws may affect demand for our platform. Additionally, as our platform’s geographic scope expands, regulatory agencies or courts may claim that we are subject to additional requirements, or are prohibited from conducting our business in or with certain jurisdictions, either generally or with respect to certain services, or that we are otherwise required to change our business practices. We believe we are in material compliance with such laws and regulations and do not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect compliance to have a material adverse effect on our business. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more comprehensive description of risks related to government regulation affecting our business. 
Intellectual Property
The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We rely upon a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, domain names, and other legal rights to establish and protect our intellectual property, and may rely on patents in the future. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention or work product assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, and contractors to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information.
As of December 31, 2021, we had six U.S. trademark registrations, two pending U.S. trademark applications, and seven foreign registrations. Additionally, we are the registered holder of a number of domain names, including www.usertesting.com.
13


Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.
