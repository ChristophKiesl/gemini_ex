ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Our Strategy
 
Our aim is to be a leading biotechnology acceleration and development company dedicated to acquiring and providing strategic resources to pre-clinical, clinical stage and near revenue healthcare companies and products. We have identified several targets that could provide a substantial pipeline of innovative and high value assets. We aim to maximize risk-adjusted returns by focusing on multiple assets throughout the discovery and development cycle. We expect to benefit from early positioning in illiquid and/or unknown private assets with multiple potential products in their development cycle and capitalize on valuation growth as they move forward in their development.

• | Strategically collaborate or in- and out-license select programs. We seek to collaborate or in- and out-license certain potentially therapeutic candidate products to biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies for preclinical and clinical development and commercialization.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Highly leverage external talent and resources. We plan to maintain and further build our team which is skilled in evaluating technologies for development and product development towards commercialization. By partnering with industry specific experts, we are able to identify undervalued assets that we can fund and assist in enhancing inherent value. We plan to continue to rely on the extensive experience of our management team to execute on our objectives.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evaluate commercialization and monetization strategies on a product-by-product basis in order to maximize the value of our product candidates or future potential products. As we move our drug candidates through development toward regulatory approval, we will evaluate several options for each drug candidate’s commercialization or monetization strategy. These options include building our own internal sales force; entering into a joint marketing partnership with another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, whereby we jointly sell and market the product; and out-licensing any product that we develop by ourselves or jointly with another party, whereby another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company sells and markets such product and pays us a royalty on sales. Our decision will be made separately for each product and will be based on a number of factors including capital necessary to execute on each option, size of the market to be addressed and terms of potential offers from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. It is too early for us to know which of these options we will pursue for our drug candidates, assuming their successful development.

• | Acquire commercially or near-commercially ready products and build out the current market for such. In addition to acquiring pre-clinical products, in assembling a diversified portfolio of healthcare assets, we plan on acquiring assets that are either FDA approved or are reasonably expected to be FDA approved within 12 months of our acquiring them. We anticipate hiring a contract sales organization to assume the bulk of the sales and distribution efforts related to any such product.

General information
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 22, 2013 under the name ISMO Technology Solutions and attempted to establish a base of operation in the information technology sector and provide IT hardware, software and support solutions to businesses and households. However, we did not pursue our business plan to any great extent due to the deteriorating health of the major shareholder and CEO, Mr. Enrique Navas.
 
On August 5, 2015, we recorded a stock split effectuated in the form a stock dividend.  The stock dividend was paid at a rate of 1.5 “new” shares for every one issued and outstanding share held. All common share amounts and per share amounts as referred throughout this report have been adjusted to reflect the stock split.
 
On April 21, 2015, we issued 2,500,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Denis Corin pursuant to a consulting agreement and Mr. Corin also agreed to join the Board of Directors. On July 15, 2016, we issued to Mr. Corin five-year warrants to purchase 150,000 shares of common stock at a price of $1.45 per share.
 
On June 1, 2015, our shareholders elected Mr. William Rosenstadt to the Board of Directors and appointed him as general counsel.  In exchange for such services for a one-year term, we agreed to pay Mr. Rosenstadt 375,000 shares of our common stock. We engaged the law firm at which Mr. Rosenstadt is a partner to provide us with legal services. We have paid for these services through the issuance to such law firm of 500,000 shares of our common stock on June 1, 2015, five-year warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock at a price of $4.15 per share on January 15, 2016 and five-year warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock at a price of $1.45 per share on July 16, 2016. On July 15, 2016, we issued Mr. Rosenstadt five-year warrants to purchase 150,000 shares of common stock at a price of $1.45 per share for his services as a director.

Also on June 1, 2015, our Board of Directors determined it was in the best interest of the Company to establish a base of operations in the biomedical industry.  As a result, the Board of Directors approved a change in the Company’s name from “ISMO Tech Solutions, Inc.” to “Q BioMed Inc.”  Q BioMed Inc. established its business as a biomedical acceleration and development company focused on licensing, acquiring and providing strategic resources to life sciences and healthcare companies.
 
On July 23, 2015, our founder and CEO, Mr. Enrique Navas, resigned from his position a director of our company and any positions that he held as an officer of the Company.  This resignation did not result from any dispute or disagreement with us, our independent accountants, our counsel or our operations, policies and practices. Mr. Navas agreed to return 3,750,000 shares of common stock owned by him to the treasury.
 
On October 27, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada to increase the number of shares of common stock that we are authorized to issue from 100,000,000 shares to 250,000,000 shares.  The Certificate of Amendment affected no provisions of our Articles of Incorporation other than the number of common stock that were are authorized to issue, and we are still authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
 
 Our Drug Discovery Approach
 
Our mission is to: (i) license and acquire innovative life sciences assets from academia or small private companies and provide the strategic capital, including intellectual, business development and financial advice to accelerate their product development timeline; (ii) commercialize innovative drug candidates with novel mechanisms of action using our ability to raise capital and bring experienced advisors to assist in developing such commercial plan; and (iii) acquire FDA approved drugs and medical devices with limited current and commercial activity with the goal of developing a larger commercial market.
Research and Development Pipeline
 
In the fiscal years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, we have incurred approximately $1.3 million and $598,000, respectively, on research and development activities, including the issuance of 50,000 and 200,000 shares of common stock issued to Bio-Nucleonics Inc. (“BNI”) and Mannin Research Inc. (“Mannin”) in the corresponding year, valued at approximately $160,000 and $548,000, respectively.
 
Mannin IP
 
On October 29, 2015, we entered into a Patent and Technology License and Purchase Option Agreement with Mannin whereby we were granted a worldwide, exclusive license on, and option to acquire, certain Mannin intellectual property (“Mannin IP”) within the four-year term (the “Mannin Exclusive License”).
 
The Mannin IP is initially focused on developing a first-in-class eye drop treatment for glaucoma. The technology platform may be expanded in scope beyond ophthalmological uses and may include cystic kidney disease and others. The initial cost to acquire the Mannin Exclusive License was $50,000 and the issuance of 200,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $548,000, subject to an 18-month restriction from trading and subsequent leak-out conditions. Upon Mannin completing a successful phase 1 proof of concept trial in glaucoma, we will be obligated to issue an additional 1,000,000 shares of our common stock to Mannin, also subject to leak-out conditions. We believe this milestone could occur in the fourth quarter of 2018.
 
Pursuant to the Mannin Exclusive License, we may purchase the Mannin IP within the next four years in exchange for: (i) investing a minimum of $4,000,000 into the development of the Mannin IP and (ii) possibly issuing Mannin additional shares of our common stock based on meeting pre-determined valuation and market conditions.  During the year ended November 30, 2016, we incurred approximately $1.1 million in research and development expenses to fund the costs of development of the eye drop treatment for glaucoma pursuant to the Exclusive License, of which an aggregate of $654,000 was already paid as of November 30, 2016.  Through November 30, 2016, we funded an aggregate of $704,000 to Mannin under the Exclusive License.
 
In the event that: (i) we do not exercise the option to purchase the Mannin IP; (ii) we fail to invest the $4,000,000 within four years from the date of the Mannin Exclusive License; or (iii) we fail to make a diligent, good faith and commercially reasonable effort to progress the Mannin IP, all Mannin IP shall revert back to Mannin and we shall be granted the right to collect twice the monies invested through that date of reversion by way of a royalty along with other consideration which may be perpetual.
 
Bio-Nucleonics IP
 
On May 30, 2016, we entered into a Patent and Technology License and Purchase Option Agreement with BNI, which agreement was amended on September 6, 2016, whereby we were granted a worldwide, exclusive license on certain BNI intellectual property (“BNI IP”) and the option to acquire the BNI IP within three years of the BNI (the “BNI Exclusive License”).
 
The BNI IP consists of generic Strontium Chloride SR89 (“SR89”) (Generic Metastron®) and all of BNI’s intellectual property relating to it. Currently, SR89 is a radiopharmaceutical option for cancer bone pain therapy. We plan on exploring options to broaden the technology platform in scope to uses beyond metastatic bone pain. In exchange for the consideration, we agreed, upon reaching various milestones, to issue to BNI an aggregate of 110,000 shares of common stock that are subject to restriction from trading until commercialization of the product (approximately 12 months) and subsequent leak-out conditions, and provide funding to BNI for an aggregate of $850,000 in cash, of which we had paid $20,000 as of November 30, 2016.  Once we have funded up to $850,000 in cash, we may exercise the option to acquire the BNI IP at no additional charge.  In September 2016, we issued 50,000 shares of common stock, with a fair value of $160,500, to BNI pursuant to the BNI Exclusive License.

We are not obligated to provide further funding to BNI until BNI satisfies all of its pre-existing obligations to third party vendors totaling $163,500.  To this end, we had provided an aggregate of approximately $38,000 through November 30, 2016 to BNI to help settle its obligations, which we recognized as research and development expenses in the accompanying Statements of Operations.
 
In the event that: (i) we do not exercise the option to purchase the BNI IP; (ii) we fail to invest the $850,000 within three years from the date of the Exclusive License; or (iii) we fail to make a diligent, good faith and commercially reasonable effort to progress the BNI IP, all BNI IP shall revert back to BNI and we shall be granted the right to collect twenty percent of the monies invested through that date of reversion by way of a royalty until such time that the aggregate of royalties paid exceeds twice the aggregate of all total cash investment paid by Q Bio along with other consideration which may be perpetual.
 
Patents and Intellectual Property Rights
 
If products we acquired do not have adequate intellectual protection, we will take the necessary steps to protect our proprietary therapeutic product candidate assets and associated technologies that are important to our business consisting of seeking and maintaining domestic and international patents. These may cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that may be commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business. Our competitive position depends on our ability to obtain patents on our technologies and our potential products, to defend our patents, to protect our trade secrets and to operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets of others. We seek licenses from others as appropriate to enhance or maintain our competitive position.
 
In connection with Man-01, the drug candidate for the treatment of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma, we hold a license to all intellectual property related thereto. A U.S. patent was filed in 2015 as it related to Man-01, and we plan to file international patent applications in 2016.
 
In connection with SR89, we hold a license to all intellectual property related thereto.
 
We do not hold, and have not applied for, any patents.
 
Competition
 
We operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, will compete with established therapies, as well as new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in the fields in which we research, some in direct competition with us. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. New developments, including the development of other biological and pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace. Developments by competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. We will also face competition from these third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates.
 
Our generic SR89 product candidate will compete directly with Metastron® which is produced by a subsidiary of General Electric Company, a company with a market capitalization of over $250 billion. Metastron is currently the sole SR89 product for the treatment of cancer related bone pain, and we may not be able to penetrate this market sufficiently. General Electric Company may choose to significantly reduce the cost of Metastron, and we may face further price competition if other companies choose to produce a generic SR89 product. Such price competition may cause us to reduce our price and in turn, decrease any revenues we may generate.
 
Government Regulation
 
The clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of our product candidates, Man-01 and our SR89 product candidate, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable health authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market our product candidates until we receive approval of a BLA from the FDA. The process of obtaining BLA approval is expensive, often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. In addition to the significant clinical testing requirements, our ability to obtain marketing approval for these products depends on obtaining the final results of required non-clinical testing, including characterization of the manufactured components of our product candidates and validation of our manufacturing processes. The FDA may determine that our product manufacturing processes, testing procedures or facilities (or those of third parties upon which we rely) are insufficient to justify approval. Approval policies or regulations may change and the FDA has substantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed.

The FDA or another regulatory agency can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:
 

• | the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication; 
• | the FDA may not accept clinical data from trials which are conducted by individual investigators or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the United States; 
• | the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA for approval; 
• | we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate’s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks; 
• | the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials; 
• | the FDA may fail to approve our manufacturing processes or facilities or those of third-party manufacturers with which we or our collaborators contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or
• | the approval policies or regulations of the FDA may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval. 

 
With respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve additional product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, recent events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.
 
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Federal, state, and international environmental laws may impose certain costs and restrictions on our business. We do not believe that we have yet spent or lost money due to these laws and regulations.
Product Liability and Insurance
 
We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and the eventual sale and use of any product candidates, and claims could be brought against us if use or misuse of one of our product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. While we intend to maintain product liability insurance relating to our clinical trials, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us and we may be unable to maintain such insurance. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources or destroy the prospects for commercialization of the product which is the subject of any such claim. We are unable to predict if we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance for any products that may be approved for marketing. Additionally, we have entered into various agreements where we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to our product candidates. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications. We currently do not maintain product liability insurance.
Employees
 
As of February 24, 2017, we had no employees and four management consultants.
 
Properties
 
We do not own any properties. We have set up a leased office space in the Cayman Islands.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
We are not a party to any material pending legal proceeding, arbitration or governmental investigation, and to the best of our knowledge, no such proceedings have been initiated against us.
