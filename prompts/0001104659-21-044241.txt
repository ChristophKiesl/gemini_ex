ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Introduction
 
We design and develop technologies that have been shown to significantly improve key performance characteristics of combustion systems, including emission and operational performance, energy efficiency, safety and overall cost-effectiveness. We believe that our patented ClearSign Core™ technology can enhance the performance of combustion systems in a broad range of markets, including the energy (upstream oil production and down-stream refining), institutional, commercial and industrial boiler, chemical, and petrochemical industries. Our ClearSign Core technology, which is our primary technology, uses a porous ceramic structure or metal flame holder device held at a distance from the injection planes of a burner to significantly reduce flame length and achieve very low emissions without the need for external flue gas recirculation, selective catalytic reduction, or excess air systems. To date, our operations have been funded primarily through sales of our equity securities. We have earned nominal revenue since inception in 2008.
 
Our combustion technology has been successfully installed in commercial projects across four different combustion applications. These applications include our process burner technology which is currently being optimized to suit high-intensity multiple burner industrial applications and our boiler burner technology which is being configured to achieve performance certification for commercialization in China and also deployment in the USA. Based on the results of our testing and initial field installations, we believe that combustion equipment utilizing ClearSign Core technology is more effective and cost-efficient than current industry-standard air pollution control technologies, such as selective catalytic reduction devices, low- and ultra-low NOx burners (which address nitrogen oxides or NOx), external flue gas recirculation systems and other similar technologies. Such air pollution control systems are widely used in places within our current target markets such as in petroleum refining and petrochemical process heaters, large-scale once through steam generators (OTSGs), enclosed flares, institutional commercial and industrial boilers and other similar equipment. We believe that our ClearSign Core technology can provide value to our prospective customers not only by helping them meet current and possible future legislative mandates to reduce pollutant emissions, but by also increasing operating efficiency and reducing capital expenditures while remaining compliant with operating permit emissions requirements.
 
Based on the limited operating data we have obtained from installations, burners utilizing ClearSign Core technology provide increased heat transfer efficiency compared to standard burner designs. This is consistent with the physics of heat transfer and the mechanisms by which the technology functions. The increased heat transfer efficiency as reported potentially results in cost savings in the low to mid-single digit percentage range, which we believe would produce an extremely attractive pay-back period for an investment in ClearSign Core technology-based burners. In addition, since the flames in a ClearSign Core system are established from a predominantly premixed stream of fuel, combustion air and flue gasses, and are stabilized on a downstream structure that promotes turbulence and ignition the flames form with minimal “bulking up” as typically results from the traditional slow mixing of the fuel and air, and dilutive inert flue gasses. The result of this is that flame volumes are small, thus virtually eliminating flame impingement and enabling the burners to function better in tightly spaced heaters compared to the flames of traditional low NOx burners. As a result, heaters utilizing ClearSign Core technology appear to require less maintenance, operate at a lower cost, and have increased productivity compared to heater operations constrained by traditional enlarged low NOx flames and limited internal furnace volumes. Most importantly, using our technology has the potential to decrease process downtime.

Although less developed at this time, we are designing and commercializing a range of sensing products. The market potential can be viewed as a primary addressable market and a secondary potential market. The primary addressable market is similar to that of our ClearSign Core technology. We expect our technology to replace the existing flame sensing technology. In addition, the flame sensing products are applicable to all installed burners, including in markets and regions beyond those where reducing emissions is a high priority. The secondary potential market is outside of the typical combustion industry and includes transportation industries. While use of this fundamental technology in applications intended for transportation markets is proven, the development and refinement of specific products, obtaining the certifications required for commercial deployment and establishing an efficient manufacturing source and channels to market will take some time, and we cannot assure that these goals will be achieved. We believe our sensing technologies provide valuable diversification for our future business and that they have wide-ranging global applications, as compared to our burner technology which is focused on regions requiring emissions reduction. Like the burner technology, the burner sensing technology is being developed to provide convenient replacement and retrofit solutions in existing equipment in addition to inclusion in newly built equipment. We believe that the opportunities for applications of our sensor technology in the transportation market are global and of great value but will also take longer to commercialize for the reasons stated above. We anticipate that this will allow for the continued expansion and growth of our business beyond the maturation of our combustion related businesses.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in Washington on January 23, 2008. The address of our corporate headquarters is 12870 Interurban Avenue South, Seattle, Washington 98168 and our telephone number is (206) 673-4848. Our website can be accessed at www.clearsign.com. The information contained on or that may be obtained from our website is not a part of this report. We currently operate in the United States and through a subsidiary in the People’s Republic of China.
Our Industry
 
The combustion and emissions control markets are significant, both in the wide array of industries in which the systems are used and in the amount of money spent in installing and upgrading systems. Combustion systems are used to provide heat for all manner of industrial processes, including boilers, furnaces, kilns and gas turbines. In order to maximize energy efficiency while keeping pace with regulatory guidelines for air pollution emissions, operators of combustion systems are continually installing, maintaining and upgrading a variety of costly process control, air pollution control and monitoring systems. Although we believe that there are many potential markets for our ClearSign Core technology, to date we have limited the introduction of this technology to petroleum refining process heaters, energy infrastructure process heaters, steam generation, boiler burners, and enclosed flares.
 
Our initial target markets center on the energy sector, including upstream crude oil production through the use of OTSGs and wellhead enclosed flares and downstream oil refineries through the use of process heaters and boilers. In recent years, the energy sector has been significantly affected by the volatile market price of crude oil and marginal economic growth. Crude oil prices stabilized during 2016 and 2017 and enjoyed appreciation with the general post 2016 upswing in certain commodities and improved economic outlook. Prices plunged with the economic uncertainties that emerged from the pandemic in the spring of 2020 but stabilized through the summer and returned to pricing that is close to the five year average by the end of 2020. Regardless of the effect of crude oil price volatility, based upon our experience and feedback from current and prospective customers, we believe that the value of our ClearSign Core burner technology to the energy sector continues to be validated because of the technology’s ability to cost-effectively lower emissions and drive certain operational efficiencies.
 
We believe operators in all of our domestic target markets are under pressure to meet current and proposed federal, state and local pollution emissions standards. The standards applicable to our target markets have been developed over the past 50 years with broad political input. Due to the localized effects of poor air quality, we expect these standards to continue to become more stringent regardless of political leadership. We believe this to be the case in the U.S. and worldwide in most major developed and developing countries. As an illustration, air pollution emission standards are most stringent in the states of California and Texas, two states which, historically have had leadership from different political parties. As a result, these standards are a significant driver for our development and sales efforts. We believe that our ClearSign Core technology can provide a unique, cost-effective pollution control solution for operators in comparison to all known competing products.

Emissions standards largely emanate from the Clean Air Act, which is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and regulates six common criteria air pollutants, including ground-level ozone. These regulations are enforced by state and local air quality districts as part of their compliance plans. As a precursor to ground-level ozone, NOx is a regulated pollutant by local air quality districts in order to achieve the EPA limits. The 8-hour ground-level ozone regulations have been reduced from 84 parts per billion (ppb) in 1997, to 75 ppb in 2008, and 70 ppb in 2015, with the requirement of realizing these levels approximately 25 years following the year of legislation.
 
We have noted that local air quality districts in EPA designated “severe non-attainment zones” in California and Texas have undertaken a review of their air pollutant emissions regulations. In most regions these reviews are ongoing but the amended regulations for the San Joaquin Valley region of California issued in December 2020 indicate a significant reduction in the target NOx emissions from boilers, steam generators and process heaters and it is anticipated that the outcome of the rule revisions from the other non-attainment regions will be similar.
 
Although NOx emissions from refineries and other oil production and processing operations are highly regulated as they are considered a significant source of stationary NOx emissions, enclosed flares have not historically been viewed as a source requiring the same level of regulation. We believe that our ClearSign Core technology is uniquely able to address the emissions challenges being faced by oil producers and other industries as those challenges relate to both current and reasonably predictable future local air emission standards.
 
Additionally, we believe that current emissions standards in Europe, the Middle East, parts of Asia and Canada will continue to trend towards stricter air emission standards as these jurisdictions seek to achieve cleaner air. Existing and new emissions standards in such jurisdictions may create additional market opportunities for us.
 
Our Proprietary Technology
 
ClearSign Core Burner Technology
 
The name “ClearSign Core” was adopted to describe the inclusion of ClearSign’s burner technology in the products of original equipment burner manufacturers. Including our technology in OEM burner products enables us to leverage our technology by providing OEMs with the ability to offer a new product range with our technologies’ unique capabilities and distinctively differentiated product performance in combination with their global manufacturing, order fulfillment and service capabilities.
 
Our ClearSign Core burner technology consists of an industrial burner body and a downstream porous ceramic structure or metal flame stabilizing device. When the unreacted mixture of gaseous fuel and air is directed at the ceramic or metal downstream flame stabilizing structure, the mixture ignites and the flame forms either within or immediately downstream of the structure itself. Because the fuel and air have more time to mix, the homogeneous mixture mitigates NOx-forming hot spots and the associated chemistry that is typically produced. The mixing and combustion propagating from the flame stabilizing structure results in a dramatically shorter flame, and modification of the structure enables a high level of control over the shape of the flame. As a result, the flame can be optimized for a wide range of different applications. NOx, a regulated greenhouse gas pollutant comprised of nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide, can be greatly reduced, often to levels of 5 ppm or below, depending on the specific application, without any external fans or associated power, thereby minimizing harmful emissions while improving system efficiency. A shorter flame can often allow for operation of the furnace at a higher capacity. We believe ClearSign Core’s flame structure and heat transfer profile, which results from the premixing of fuel, flue gas and combustion air in combination with the downstream flame stabilizing device enhances thermal efficiency, minimizes the possibility of flame impingement, reduces the likelihood of carbon deposits forming on the inside surfaces of the process tubes (coking) and reduces the likelihood of process tube failure; thereby extending the length of time a heater can remain in operation before the need for maintenance.

ClearSign Core Plug & Play
 
Our ClearSign Core Plug & Play product provides a simplified, pre-engineered and standardized direct burner replacement for traditional refinery process heaters. We believe that this product will minimize the customized engineering associated with retrofits and lend itself to mass production. The product derives its name from the fact that it is designed to allow quick and easy installation into a multi-burner heater or furnace and possibly allow the heater to continue operating during installation rather than be shut down. We believe that the simplicity of the actions required to retrofit refinery process heaters with the ClearSign Core Plug & Play, and the potential ability to install the ClearSign Core Plug & Play while the remaining burner system is operational, will lead to increased demand for, and ultimately sales of, our ClearSign Core burners.
ClearSign Core Boiler Burner Technology
 
Our ClearSign Core boiler burner technology is, in essence, the same as the process burner technology. The details of the components are different due to the different orientation of the boiler application, the different internal chamber dimensions and the fact that a boiler operates with a relatively high combustion air pressure, and in the case of a small fire tube boiler, a lower fuel gas pressure. The concept of incorporating the ClearSign Core technology into a typical OEM burner remains the same.
ClearSign Core Flaring Burners
 
Our ClearSign Core flaring technology incorporates the same principles as our burner technology, namely directing the fuel gas, in this case typically waste gas, into an air stream with that air and gas mixture forming a flame stabilized on a downstream flame stabilizing structure. This technology has been configured into standard modular designs that can be incorporated into a flare manufacturer’s flare body to provide a flare product with the extremely low emissions production enabled by our ClearSign technology. The standardized flare configurations are designed with standard firing capacities, and these are combined in varying quantities to enable flares to be produced with different firing rates.
ClearSign Eye™ Flame Sensor
 
The ClearSign Eye™ flame sensor is an electrical flame sensor for industrial applications. Unlike flame rods, sensing electrodes do not have to make contact with the flame. We are continuing to pursue opportunities for this patented sensing technology through both laboratory research, where we have demonstrated certain favorable attributes of this proprietary technology operating at lab scales, in addition to the initial commercial activities currently being conducted with our pilot flame sensors. We have multiple options open to us as channels to market, including manufacturing the sensors as a ClearSign original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, product that we sell either directly or through partners and intermediaries to prospective customers which is our current commercialization activity for this product line. The value of our sensing technology is that we believe it provides a very reliable alternative or replacement technology for critical safety equipment that is typically very unreliable and requires frequent maintenance on industrial burners. There are additional favorable opportunities for flame sensors on other combustion equipment such as flares, thermal oxidizer burners and boiler burners.

Our sensing technology detects the capacitance of a flame, thereby permitting the sensors to function while being physically outside of the flame envelope. This allows the entire sensor probe to be positioned in a cool region, enabling the use of materials and manufacturing processes that provide an extremely long functional life. The electrodes are optimized in shape to provide the most robust signal while being easy to retrofit into existing burner equipment.
 
Development and Deployment of Our Technology
 
To date, we have deployed our ClearSign Core technology through retrofits and replacements of existing burners and complete replacement units in the case of our Plug & Play products. Retrofits often involve engineering around an existing burner architecture that can complicate the ClearSign Core burner installation, whereas replacements are more straightforward and more amenable to being sold and installed by third parties, enabling more expansive channels to market. This is especially the case after the introduction of our Plug & Play technology in February 2017 and the simplified control and operation of this technology enabled by the inclusion of a new start up and flame initiation system in April 2019. Because of this, we have focused the development of our technology to provide designs that can be included into our prospective customers’ equipment as self-contained modules or assemblies rather than projects involving the re-engineering of existing burner systems. In this form, we believe that the ClearSign Core burner technology is ideally suited for installation into new heaters and burner replacements, including heater and furnace types requiring large quantities of burners. We have also developed the ClearSign Core flare and boiler burner technologies into similar repeatable forms to aid its inclusion in standard industry equipment on a commercial scale.
 
For simplification and marketing, we have adopted the term “ClearSign Core” to refer to the inclusion of our standardized proprietary combustion technology into a variety of combustion equipment types including, but not limited to, process heater burners, boiler burners, burners for thermal oxidizers and flares. Earlier heater retrofits in which a continuous ceramic “wall” was suspended above the existing burners also still operate and continue to be referred to as “Duplex” technology. The combustion controlling principles of both the “ClearSign Core” and “Duplex” technologies are the same, however the difference is in the ease of use, channel to market and standardization of the technology.
 
We have now achieved emission results in multiple applications that were superior to current local Best Available Control Technology (BACT) levels in multiple installations in California related to three of our five target industries. We intend to continue to demonstrate ClearSign Core capabilities through (i) working with local air quality officials to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technology, (ii) operating in-place units, (iii) engineering and testing with new customers, (iv) pursuing additional lab research and developing new applications (e.g. institutional commercial and industrial boilers) and next generation improvements to ClearSign Core design and standardization, including the pursuit of more complete systems similar to the ClearSign Core Plug & Play for application in other vertical markets, and (v) assisting our customers in making emission results available for designation as BACT by local regulatory bodies.
 
ClearSign Core Technology Product Applications
 
To date, we have deployed our ClearSign Core technology through retrofits and replacements of existing burners. As noted above, retrofits often involved engineering around an existing burner architecture that can complicate the installation. This was the case with the old “Duplex” technology, which we no longer install other than for the servicing of existing units. Replacements are more straightforward, especially after the introduction of our Plug & Play technology in February 2017, now developed into our ClearSign Core. By developing our ClearSign Core technology to enable a replacement product, we are able to standardize our designs, simplify inventory and, by removing the need to individually engineer every application, we are able to collaborate with other commercial equipment suppliers to incorporate our ClearSign Core technology into their standard product lines, greatly increasing our potential market reach and the resources we are able to make available to our prospective customers.

Process Heaters in the Oil Refining Industry
 
To date, we have retrofitted two multi burner process heaters with our new ClearSign Core burners, two process heaters with the old standard Duplex design and one demonstration unit with the prior Duplex Plug & Play design. The ClearSign Core “Plug & Play” design provides a more simplified, pre-engineered and standardized direct burner replacement for traditional refinery process heaters. We believe that this product will reduce the customized engineering associated with typical retrofits and lend itself to mass production. This is our most developed burner product, able to operate in the same way as a standard burner and to fit into a heater and with existing control systems. We believe that this product is suitable for licensing as well as potential manufacturing arrangements with OEMs that have established manufacturing and distribution capabilities. At this time we have a collaboration agreement in place with the world’s second largest combustion equipment manufacturer Zeeco Inc. This agreement is contingent on the successful completion of a comprehensive product performance and validation test which is part of an equipment supply order for ExxonMobil. We believe we are close to achieving success with this test. In February 2021 we received a purchase order from a second global supermajor refining company, and our first international order for a ClearSign Core refining process heater.
 
We plan to continue extending the range of ClearSign Core Plug & Play devices to allow the replacement of other burner shapes and configurations, as well as alternate process applications, to further enhance the market available for this product.
 
Wellhead Enclosed Flares
 
Based upon discussions with local regulators and examination of regulatory reports, we believe that enclosed flare emissions are a target for increased regulation in certain regions. We have adapted the ClearSign Core technology to suit this application. To date with have ten flare units installed and operating. In 2019, with the development of our standardized ClearSign Core flare technology, we formed a non-exclusive collaborative alliance with the flare OEM, ASHCOR, to enhance our potential sales reach and production capabilities while providing ASHCOR with unique product capability. We have also formed sales and installation agreement with field engineering and servicing company California Boiler. The most recent installation of four of these flare units were the result of these collaborations.
 
OTSGs for the Enhanced Oil Recovery Industry
 
We have successfully installed our Duplex technology in three OTSG projects in the enhanced oil recovery industry in California. We believe that these successful installations are gaining acceptance by the Southern California regulatory authorities and, as a result, market acceptance as well. Field data reported by our customer indicates significant efficiency improvements resulting from the installation of the ClearSign technology.
 
Industrial Commercial Boilers
 
There are a large number of boiler manufacturers producing many styles of boiler equipment for many different applications. Boilers are used in many industrial applications, as well as in commercial and residential applications at much smaller scales. We are currently actively working on commercial boiler applications for two distinct types of industry standard commercial boilers – fire tube and water tube boilers. For fire tube products, we have recently developed our own prototype burner replacement product that is similar in concept to our ClearSign Core Plug and Play device for process heaters. This product has achieved excellent results after testing in a typical commercial fire tube boiler produced by one of the industry’s largest suppliers in the USA and in a second demonstration installation in China. Water tube boilers are larger and more varied in their designs. Water tube boiler burner and fire tube boiler burner field verification projects are being undertaken in China and are ongoing. We anticipate significant progress during 2021 in testing this equipment although progress has been delayed by the effects of the SARS-COV-2 virus (coronavirus or COVID-19). We have a collaboration agreement in place with California Boiler to sell, deliver, install and service fire tube boiler burners in the USA. This collaboration also allows access to larger sizes of fire tube boilers to verify the function of a full range of fire tube boiler burners. If the testing is successful in China, our goal will be to sell the boiler burner technology into the very large Chinese market through our Chinese subsidiary in collaboration with strategic partners in China.

Technical Components of our ClearSign Core Technology
 
Our ClearSign Core burner technology consists of an industrial burner with our ClearSign Core technology added in place of the traditional burner gas tips, flame stabilization device and refractory tile. The ClearSign Core consists of a series of gas tips arranged inside the combustion air stream at the point it passes the boundary into a heater. Some distance downstream is a primary or ignition device followed by the porous ceramic structure or metal flame stabilizing device. Between the injection point of the fuel gas and the primary or ignition device is a support structure and a mixing tube or tubes that optimize the flow of the fuel and air mixture onto the primary or ignition device and the flame stabilizing device. When the unreacted mix of gaseous fuel and air is directed at the flame stabilizing structure, the mixture ignites and burns within or immediately downstream of the structure. Because the fuel and air have more time to mix, the homogeneous mixture greatly reduces NOx- forming hot spots that are typically produced with existing technology. The premixing of the fuel and combustion air in combination with the accelerated ignition and flame formation created by the downstream flame stabilization device results in a dramatically shorter flame. NOx, a regulated pollutant comprised of nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide, is greatly reduced, often to levels of 5ppm or below, depending on the specific application, without any external fans or associated power, thereby minimizing harmful emissions while improving system efficiency. A shorter flame allows for consistent operation of the furnace at a higher capacity. As noted above, we believe ClearSign burner technologies’ heat transfer profile both increases a heater’s productivity and operational run time and reduces heater maintenance costs by: (i) enhancing thermal efficiency, (ii) reducing the probability of flame impingement and the likelihood that carbon deposits form on the inside surfaces of the process tubes (coking), and (iii) reducing the likelihood of process tube failures.

ClearSign Core Performance
 
We have now achieved emission results in multiple applications that exceeded current local BACT levels, including in multiple installations in California related to three of our five target industries. As indicated above, we intend to continue to demonstrate ClearSign Core capabilities through (i) working with local air quality officials to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technology, (ii) operating in-place units, (iii) engineering and testing with new customers and applications, (iv) pursuing additional lab research and development of new applications and next generation improvements to ClearSign Core design and standardization, including the pursuit of more complete systems similar to the process burner ClearSign Core Plug & Play for applications in other vertical markets, and (v) assisting our customers in making emission results available for designation as BACT by local regulatory bodies.
Our Target Markets
 
Our ClearSign Core products compete in the combustion and emissions control markets. These are highly competitive industries that are currently dominated by companies which, compared to ClearSign, have more established products and substantially greater infrastructure, customer support networks, and financial resources. Based on the testing and the field installations completed to date, however, we believe that our ClearSign Core technology provides a unique and powerful ability to improve energy efficiency and operational performance, while at the same time significantly reducing emissions, leading to an overall cost-effective installation. Further, we believe that our technology is well suited to create substantial synergistic value through its incorporation into the mainstream commercial offerings of the market incumbents as a “ClearSign Core”, thus leveraging the ClearSign technology and the established breadth and capabilities of collaborating companies.
 
We are targeting the following segments of the combustion market for our ClearSign Core technology:
 

· | institutional, commercial and industrial boilers;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | refinery, energy infrastructure and petrochemical process heaters;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | large industrial boilers;
--+--------------------------


· | enclosed flares; and
--+---------------------


· | enhanced oil recovery steam generators
--+---------------------------------------

 
In each segment, we are marketing solutions that include our ClearSign Core technology which we believe could simultaneously improve productivity, operational efficiency and pollution control.
 
Our target markets are greatly affected by air emission regulations and economic conditions. Accordingly, our target market segments are also prioritized geographically based on the needs of the local industries and current and anticipated future demands of local environmental legislature. Details of the localized effect of these influences in the United States are described in the section of this report titled “Our Industry.” In general our immediate regional opportunities are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States, and the regions of Northern China with high populations and cooler environments where district heating is a large source of fossil fuel consumption and where reducing atmospheric pollution is a high priority of the national and local governments.
 
Competition, Barriers to Entry and Go to Market Strategy
 
The industry in which we operate is global in scope and is populated by large, established suppliers of burners and post-combustion air pollution control systems, most of which possess substantially greater resources than we do. Worldwide, suppliers of burners and air pollution control equipment include but are not limited to companies such as UOP, Callidus, Eclipse and Maxon (all four are subsidiaries of Honeywell), John Zink Hamworthy Combustion (a subsidiary of Koch Industries and including Coen), General Electric, Haldor Topsøe, Hitachi, Linde, Zeeco and Fives Group, among others.

These systems include low and ultra-low NOX burners, selective and non-selective catalytic reduction systems and other pollution control technologies. The companies that provide these systems are well established and their combustion and emissions control technologies are mostly based on mature, well-understood technologies that are proven in the market. We believe the further development of their technologies, however, will be limited largely to marginal performance improvements. As a consequence of the relatively slow pace of adopting innovation, we believe current technology offerings from the large competitors have become largely commoditized, and differentiation between suppliers is very often based largely on price. This provides both an opportunity and a barrier to more nimble, disruptive companies.
 
From a customer's perspective, legacy air pollution control technologies are viewed as a cost of doing business, and as a means to operate within current and anticipated future regulatory requirements and to avoid fines.
 
Unlike most other kinds of capital equipment that provide an economic return through enhanced productivity or efficiency, we believe customers of traditional emissions control equipment do not expect any positive return on emissions control investments other than the right to continue operations or avoidance of fines. We believe the ClearSign Core suite of products offers prospective customers the unique opportunity to greatly reduce capital investment and to realize a return on investment through increased efficiency and/or increased productivity, thereby further differentiating the Company’s technologies from the competition.
 
As indicated above, we are seeking to develop our business in the combustion and emissions control market and to establish ourselves in a highly competitive industry among companies that have substantial financial resources, a well-developed infrastructure and established products. The business development strategy for ClearSign is planned and being implemented to enable recognition of the ClearSign technology’s value while minimizing the challenges set forth below - many of which stem from the nature of the customers in this market as well as from the strengths of the other market participants.
 
Major barriers faced by a new equipment manufacturer seeking to enter this market include:
 

1. | Developing engineering, order fulfillment and customer service staff: Especially in the refining and petrochemical industries, customers require specialist support throughout the purchasing, order execution and life cycle of the combustion equipment. Recruiting and developing sufficient staff with the specialist skills necessary to provide the level of service required by customers in this market would take time and result in a significant ongoing overhead cost.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Developing operational infrastructure: Again, especially in the refining and petrochemical industries, customers require thorough quality assurance procedures, which include seeing one article from the product order demonstrated in order meet performance guarantees. This requires, among other things, having access to a test furnace. Developing such an operation would require significant investment and ongoing costs.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Conservative customers: Because of the complexity of the customers’ infrastructures, the cost of downtime in any part of a processing plant and due to the potential safety hazards posed by the nature of their operations, the customers are very careful and methodical about adopting a new technology or product from a new unproven supplier.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Profit opportunity: There is very little differentiation between the products of the established burner equipment providers resulting in thin profit margins on the sale of new or replacement burners. A significant portion of a company’s profit results from the sales of replacement parts and equipment upgrades. Any new entrant without a differentiating technology will not have this established source of significant and immediate profit.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The “go to market” strategy for the ClearSign Core combustion business has been developed considering both the Company’s strengths and weaknesses. The most important weaknesses are highlighted by the barriers to entry identified above: we are a small company with limited financial resources and we do not have the infrastructure to meet the requirements of our sophisticated target global customers. Although we have highly skilled and experienced employees, we do not have the manpower to provide comprehensive service and customer support ourselves. We could overcome these limitations with a significant investment and an increase in operational costs; we believe, however, that it is in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders to develop our business with an asset light model to the extent this can enable a timely path to mainstream operations and maximum profitability.

Our strengths include our technology, which has been developed to provide a standard set of “core” components that can be incorporated into any generic OEM burner body and enable unique performance that both minimize emissions and controls flame size. Our strengths also include the market opportunity potentially created by new and anticipated environmental emissions control regulations. These regulations will potentially require combustion performance that either exceeds the technology available from the incumbent equipment manufacturers or requires retrofitting existing equipment with a post-combustion clean up apparatus. Installation of clean-up apparatus is very expensive - especially for small to mid-sized heaters. We believe that the incumbent burner OEM product development approaches are, and will continue to be, incremental in nature, and are unlikely to pose a significant threat to the value provided by ClearSign Core technology in the foreseeable future.
 
Our business has been, and continues to be, developed with the goal of combining our technology with the infrastructure and resources of major OEM equipment manufacturers. Through such a collaborative arrangement, an OEM burner manufacturer can reap the benefits of adding a truly differentiated and unique product line to its offering and ClearSign can overcome the barriers to market resulting from the need for a capital and operating expense-intensive infrastructure and a large specialist staff. In addition, we believe that having orders fulfilled by a well-known and trusted supplier will reduce the risk, as perceived by prospective customers, of dealing with a small company and aid in the adoption of our technology.
 
Our business plan contemplates forming collaborative partnerships with major OEM equipment manufacturers. At this time, our technology has been demonstrated to have commercial viability and has generated interest from end users and OEMs. We expect that the development of strategically chosen collaborative partnerships will result in the supply of ClearSign Core technology to major global customers in large quantities and with the engineering, quality control, customer support and project management services such sophisticated customers require. These relationships will also enable our OEM partners to offer a unique product in the marketplace, providing a potentially significant commercial opportunity for both them and us. We believe forming such alliances will dramatically accelerate the global sales and market adoption rate of our technology.  As announced in June 2019, we already have an agreement in place with Zeeco Inc., the world’s second largest burner manufacturer. Under this agreement, Zeeco will provide ClearSign Core process burners globally. This agreement is contingent on the successful completion of a burner demonstration that is part of ongoing supply order for ExxonMobil which we believe that we are close to achieving. In addition, we have a collaborative agreement with ASHCOR with respect to our flare product and a collaborative agreement with California Boiler to sell and produce both fire tube boiler burner and flare products. We are also pursuing various other licensing like arrangements for other market verticals and ClearSign Core applications.
 
Pricing Strategy. Our target markets are characterized by well-established competitors in mature businesses. As a result, competitive pricing rather than pricing based on broad product value is the standard for these markets. However, we believe that our technology improves combustion equipment performance with unique capabilities and therefore provides significant economic value to our customers compared to the next best alternative solutions available. This, in turn, should enable products containing ClearSign Core technology to sell at prices reflecting the value they offer. Consequently, we believe that the value the ClearSign Core technology provides to the OEMs partnering with us will result in compensation to us based on that value.
Sensing Products. Our sensing products are not yet through the final commercialization phase of the development and product launch process. We have obtained clear and consistent customer feedback guiding the first application of this technology. The target market for this technology is potentially every burner with a pilot on which flame sensors are deployed, providing a global and very high-volume opportunity. This market is not limited by emissions mandates or the type or manufacturer of the burners. The product is also of value for both retrofit applications, where it is applied to existing burners, and to new burners, where it will be installed in the burners by the original burner manufacturer.
 
11


The technology is proven, final product design details are being completed for our target application and we are assessing various product business strategies. Unlike the ClearSign Core burner technology, we are assessing both the possibility that we manufacture the sensing products along with the alternative of partnering with one or more established OEM suppliers. We have manufactured demonstration units and are currently planning to manufacture the sensor ourselves for the foreseeable future.
 
The fundamental technology for the sensors envisioned for transport applications is the same as for the flame sensors, but the application and form of the final product will be very different. We have received notable interest in this product from a major global customer giving us the confidence that this is a market and technology worthy of future investment. This product is in the very early stages of development, and the application will be highly regulated so it will require a thorough product development process. However, we believe indications to date suggest this is potentially a significant future business opportunity for ClearSign.
 
Research and Development Program
 
The experience and industry contacts of our management team, board of directors, and consultants with potential customers in the petroleum, petrochemical, and industrial steam applications industries inform our research program. These are supported by field evaluation agreements, research agreements, and memoranda of understanding with potential development partners, customers and research institutions. Our research and development activities make use of employees and consultants who are experts in the areas of industrial combustion, statistical experimental design, gas turbines, fluid mechanics and heat transfer.
 
With the maturation of our ClearSign Core technology, our development process has transitioned from research to commercialization. This has included optimizing the technology to perform in a manner readily adoptable by our prospective customers and easy to implement into the burner structures of our collaborative alliance partners. There are many influences on this later phase of development including customer feedback, product and component standardization, design for manufacture and considerations to simplify inventory management, both for the manufacture and the lifetime support of our products.
 
Our technology and products for flame sensing applications are proven in our laboratory at bench scale and in full scale “first article” form. This product is currently in the commercialization phase. As discussed above, we also have another form of our sensing technology that we believe can indicate the potential flammability of a hydrocarbon gas and air mixture, which can have great and varied application in other industries such as transport. This product is in an earlier form and is currently undergoing validation and optimization of its intended role in this very different application.
 
Intellectual Property Protection
 
We have generated inventions that we believe to be patentable subject matter and for which we have been seeking protection through patent application filings. As of December 31, 2020, we have 135 active patent grants and another 51 patents pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The earliest year in which any of our patents will expire is 2031. We have been granted 47 patents related to our ClearSign Core technology and 77 patents related to our ECC technology. We maintain an active review process to monitor relevant new inventions to expand our intellectual property protection globally.
 
We cannot predict when our patent applications may result in issued patents, if at all. Further, we may modify a patent application in the future as we develop additional information. As a result, we may create additional patent applications from an existing application, consolidate existing patent applications, abandon applications, or otherwise modify applications based upon our judgment in order to protect our intellectual property in a reasonably cost beneficial manner.

Government Regulation
 
Government regulation, particularly environmental regulation, is likely to play an important role in shaping our product mix and offerings. Field implementation of our technologies requires permits from various local, state and federal agencies that regulate mechanical and electrical infrastructure and fire and air pollution control.
 
We believe that we offer major advances in emissions reductions and efficiency improvements. We also believe emissions regulations could enhance market demand for technology if such regulations require a reduction in pollutants such as NOX and CO. In such cases, possible legislation on greenhouse gases, boiler Maximum Available Control Technology (MACT) rules, or general reductions in required criteria pollutant levels globally, and especially in the U.S. and China, could bolster our business objectives. Although the timing of such regulations is uncertain, the general trend over the last decades continues to be government-mandated reduction for all criteria pollutants. Ultimately, it may be possible for our technology to achieve BACT designation. We believe the availability of our technology, by itself, may accelerate the government’s willingness to adopt more stringent environmental regulations. Further, we believe efficiency improvements, combined with the elimination of flame impingement, could generate market demand regardless of the existing regulatory framework because they could result in increased productivity or savings for businesses that adopt our technology.
 
At this time, we believe that the current U.S. administration is supportive of “green initiatives,” and we are not aware of any current or proposed federal, state or local environmental compliance regulations that would have a material detrimental effect on our business objectives. We do not anticipate any major expenditures to be required in order for our technology to comply with any environmental protection statutes. Concurrently the Chinese government has enacted notable tightening of allowable emissions levels, particularly for NOx emissions, and we anticipate this trend will continue in the future.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2021, we had 15 full-time employees. Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
