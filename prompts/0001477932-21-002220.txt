Brands and Products
 
Bellissima Prosecco and Sparkling Wines
 
We market and sell a line of all-natural and Vegan Prosecco and Sparkling Wine made with organic grapes, including a Zero Sugar, Zero Carb option, a DOC Brut and a Sparkling Rose. We market and sell these products under the Bellissima brand name pursuant to a license agreement entered into between our majority-owned (51%) subsidiary, Bellissima Spirits LLC (“Bellissima Spirits”), and Christie Brinkley, Inc., an entity owned by supermodel and entrepreneur Christie Brinkley (“CBI”), on November 12, 2015, which agreement was amended effective June 30, 2017 (the “Bellissima Agreement”). During her illustrious career, Christie Brinkley has appeared on over 500 magazine covers worldwide, served as a spokeswoman for CoverGirl, and performed on Broadway, in television and in film.
 
The Bellissima products are produced at a winery located in Treviso, Italy. Bellissima’s winery partners manage the procurement of all raw materials required to produce a finished product of either the DOC Brut, Sparkling Rose Pinot Grigio and our Zero Sugar, Zero Carb Sparkling Wine Expression.
 
Bella Sprizz Aperitifs
 
We have also developed, and now market and sell, a line of aperitifs in partnership with Christie Brinkley under the brand name Bella Sprizz. This line of aperitifs consists of three different expressions, a classic Italian aperitif typically used in making a “Spritz,” or as we prefer to say “Sprizz.” The second product in the line is an all-natural elderflower aperitif that may be added as a component to a consumer’s favorite cocktail or simply added to another spirit, such as a glass of our Bellissima Zero Sugar. We also offer “Bella Bitter,” a classic Italian bitter that can be served over ice with a garnish, such as a squeeze of a fresh orange, or added as a component in making a superior Negroni, a popular Italian cocktail.
 
BiVi Vodka
 
We have also developed and intend to relaunch a Vodka product under the brand “BiVi 100 percent Sicilian Vodka.” We intend to market and sell this product pursuant to a License Agreement entered into between our majority-owned (51%) subsidiary, BiVi LLC (“BiVi”), and Neighborhood Licensing, LLC (“Neighborhood Licensing”), an entity owned by Chazz Palminteri. Chazz Palminteri is an American actor, screenwriter, producer and playwright who has performed on Broadway, in television and in film. He is best known for his Academy Award-nominated role for Best Supporting Actor in Bullets over Broadway, the 1993 film A Bronx Tale, based on his play of the same name 
 
BiVi Vodka is made from semolina wheat grown out of the rich volcanic soil and pure mountain spring water of Sicily and is the creation of Master Distiller Giovanni La Fauci. 
 
Private Label - Hooters
 
In addition to developing celebrity brands, we develop and supply national restaurant chains, consumer good companies, and national retailers with  high-quality, private label products. We believe that private labeling presents a significant opportunity for growth of our business. We provide full-service, turnkey private labeling-enabled expertise in product sourcing, product development, brand development, marketing and distribution.
 
We market and sell a line of private-label premium spirits under the Hooters brand, including Vodka, Gin, Rum (Dark & Light), Tequila (Silver & Gold), American Whiskey and Hooters Heat Cinnamon Whiskey. We market and sell these products pursuant to a Marketing and Distribution Agreement entered into between us and United Spirits, Inc. (“United”), a company owned and managed by Richard DeCicco, our controlling shareholder and the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and a Director of our company.

The Hooters spirits premium line of products are available in Hooters corporate restaurants in over 15 states across the United States, as well as a growing number of Hooters franchise restaurants, with expansion plans for distribution of Hooters Spirits products into off-premise retail locations.
 
Hooters of America, LLC, is the franchisor and operator of more than 420 Hooters restaurants in 42 states and 29 countries. Known for its world-famous Hooters Style chicken wings, the first Hooters restaurant opened its doors in 1983 in Clearwater, Florida.
 
We also have entered into an endorsement agreement with Chase Elliott, the driver of the No. 9 Hooters Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 1LE, pursuant to which Mr. Elliott will act as a brand ambassador for the premium line of Hooters Spirits, which agreement requires, among other agreements, the agreement of Mr. Elliot to make personal appearances at select Hooters Spirits events. Mr. Elliott, the reigning, two-time NASCAR Cup Series Most Popular Driver, has won six races since joining the NASCAR Cup Series full time in 2016 with the powerhouse Hendrick Motorsports team and has qualified for the NASCAR Playoffs each season and won the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series Championship. Prior to his debut in the premier Cup Series, Mr. Elliott won the 2014 NASCAR Xfinity Series Championship before finishing that series’ championship runner-up the following season in 2015. Elliott also has earned many accolades off of the racetrack and has made appearances on television and in films, as well as being featured in magazines and video games. Post-COVID-19, we intend to further expand this relationship. 
 
Industry Overview
 
According to Statista, the U.S. alcoholic beverages market was valued at approximately $255 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow by 5.92% annually between 2021 and 2025. Recent market data shows that from 2011 to 2019, sales increased by 30%, with an average increase of roughly 4.3% annually. Much of this growth is attributed to a shift toward spirits; the sales of the spirits category have increased substantially since 2018, averaging over 13 percent sales growth per year. 
 
According to Euromonitor, in 2019,  the “high end” and “super premium” categories experienced larger sales growth than the “premium” and “value” categories. Within the wine category, there has been a shift in consumer behavior towards Sparkling Wine and Rosé. Prosecco and Sparkling Rosé in particular have seen high growth rates.
 
This shift in consumer behavior toward premium offerings, sparkling wines and seeking new experience continued in 2020 and is forecast to continue in the next years. Despite the challenging COVID-19 context, the alcohol ecommerce industry is seeing continued growth. U.S. alcohol e-commerce approached approximately $5.6 billion in 2020, according to IWSR, up from roughly $3 billion in 2019. This growth was largely driven by the omnichannel segment as supermarkets and traditional retailers have sought to rapidly enhance their online offering.
 
According to Euromonitor, starting in 2021 the alcoholic drinks market will begin to recover after the pandemic effect on 2020 sales. Spirits are expected to see a return to positive growth in 2021. Compared to previous years, more consumption occasions will remain in the home, and ecommerce sales will continue growth. 
 Within the wine category, sparkling wine is expected to record the highest total volume CAGR, signaling that this category will be well positioned for recovery post-COVID-19.
 
According to Beverage Daily, new young consumers are looking for ethical brands that address causes they care about, which often includes the planet, animals welfare and social inclusivity, among others. 
 
In addition the direct-to-consumer channel is predicted to grow by nearly $3 billion in value between 2019 and 2024, at a CAGR of 24% over the five-year period, according to IWSR. 
 
Currently, the celebrity-branded alcoholic beverage industry is a largely consolidated industry, in which the largest companies control a significant portion of industry revenues. This includes existing industry players that are distillery companies that use their own liquor and parent brands to promote their products. These companies have a significant advantage over smaller players because they already have large bottling facilities and established brands.

Industry market share has also increased slightly during recent years as larger companies acquired smaller firms. For example, Sammy Hagar sold an 80% stake to Gruppo Campari for $80 million, Bethenny Frankel sold her Skinny Girl Cocktail brand to Fortune Brands’ Beam Global for an estimated $100M in 2011, and George Clooney sold his tequila company to Diageo for approximately $1 billion. 
 
Entrants and products in the celebrity-branded alcoholic beverage industry include, but are not limited to, Casamigos Tequila and George Clooney (2013), Ciroc Vodka and Sean Combs (2007), Skinnygirl Margarita and Bethenny Frankel (2011) and Cabo Wabo Tequila and Sammy Hagar (1996). 
 
Given the trends discussed above, we believe that there is a substantial opportunity in this market due to the rising popularity of celebrity-branded alcoholic beverages.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We intend to utilize the strength of our management team and industry consultants to focus on brands that will consistently meet the needs of customers and consumers around the world.
 
We aim to gain brand loyalty by partnering with well-known iconic celebrities and/or national chains, such as we have with Christie Brinkley, Chazz Palminteri, Chase Elliott and Hooters. We  also intend to engage in targeted and national advertising and promotional campaigns, host celebrity and other sponsored events, and offer distribution incentives. We hope to attain national exposure in order to drive both awareness and sales of our products in their markets.  In addition, we expect that on and off-premise promotions, led by our sales management team, will pay off in increased awareness and higher sales.
 
We intend to kick off promotional campaigns with launch parties, supported by on-premise samplings, contests, on and off-premise giveaways, as well as social media campaigns, the launch of additional bottle sizes, and specialty drinks and menus.  Product brochures, press kits, signage, banners, public relations, product placement, sponsorships and internet-based marketing will also be utilized to maximize brand exposure and awareness.
 
Examples of some of our promotional activities have included:
 

· | In February 2020, Christie Brinkley hosted a series of Après Ski events at The Snow Lodge in Aspen, CO (starting on February 14, 2020 - Valentine’s Day). The events included an ice bar and featured Bellissima Prosecco and Sparkling Wines, wines made with organic grapes, with Bambinis (375ml) available in all three expressions. In addition, the highlight of the evening series showcased Bellissima’s partner, Christie Brinkley, as their celebrity mixologist throughout the evening; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Hooters Spirits launched its premium line of alcohol beverages in August 2019 with first tastings taking place in and around Bristol, Tennessee. The No. 9 Hooters Spirits Chevrolet show car was at each event with the world-famous Hooters Girls on-site taking pictures with customers and fans. The debut events led up to the 2019 NASCAR Cup Series Bass Pro Shops 500 on August 17, 2019 at Bristol Motor Speedway, where Chase Elliott drove the Hendricks Motorsports No. 9 Hooters Spirits Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 1LE to a top-five finish; and
· | We have also supported the rollout of the Hooters product line with marketing initiatives to help raise awareness of the brand, both inside and outside of the Hooters restaurants, which have included event launches, contests and giveaways, such as an autographed Chase Elliott No. 9 Hooters Spirits Chevy Camaro ZL1 diecast giveaway.

We also plan to participate in consumer trade shows where wholesalers and retailers are also invited.  This will allow our sales team to meet with many of the wholesalers and retailers who are otherwise hard to reach.  Advertising and promotion will also be achieved through staff training of on-premise locations; bartenders and wait-staff will be trained to fully understand our products and market them to customers.  Incentives will then be offered to motivate sales efforts.
 
Since public relations activity can be used as an effective promotional tool to promote brands, we plan to participate in high-profile public events to create an affinity for our brands that will resonate with their target markets, help build brand loyalty and ultimately drive sales.  Among the numerous high-profile promotional and sampling campaigns that we have hosted are events at NASCAR races and events at selected Hooters locations for The College Football National Championship Game.
 
Finally, we plan to engage in direct-to-consumer sales events, such as sales through QVC or websites.

BiVi Vodka
 
We intend to relaunch, market and sell our BiVi Vodka product in 2021, pursuant to a license agreement entered into between our subsidiary, BiVi, and Neighborhood Licensing, LLC (“Neighborhood Licensing”), an entity owned by Chazz Palminteri on May 26, 2015 (the “BiVi Agreement”).

Private Label - Hooters
 
We market and sell our private label Hooters products pursuant to a marketing and distribution agreement entered into between us and United, effective as of April 1, 2019 (the “United Agreement”). Under the United Agreement, we have been granted the exclusive right to market and distribute the Hooters Spirits products line to (a) “Hooters” branded restaurants; (b) liquor distributors; and (c) off-premise, retail establishments (with all sales being made through distributors licensed to conduct business in the state of such sale) in the United States, Europe and Asia for a period of five years (which may be extended by up to an additional five years by us upon written notice to United, so long as we are not in breach of the agreement). The United Agreement provides for United to receive a fee of $1.00 per case of product sold to any wholesaler for retailer distribution. 
 
United obtained the rights to manufacture, market, distribute and sell certain alcoholic products bearing the Hooters Marks in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia pursuant to a brand licensing agreement that it had entered into with Hooters on July 23, 2018 (the “Hooters Agreement”). Pursuant to the Hooters Agreement, United was granted a non-exclusive license to use the “Hooters” Marks to manufacture, market, distribute and sell certain alcoholic products bearing the Hooters Marks in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia for a period that expired on December 31, 2020. The Hooters Agreement may be extended by up to an additional three years by United provided that it is not in breach of the agreement and that certain minimum royalty fees are paid for the extension - $315,000 for 2021, $360,000 for 2022 and $420,000 for 2023. We are currently in discussions with Hooters, and expect to extend the Hooters Agreement. Under the Hooter’s Agreement, United paid Hooters an advance of $30,000, and agreed to pay royalties to Hooters of 6% of net sales (as defined) of all products during the term. In addition, the agreement also provides for United’s payment of a marketing contribution equal to 2% of the prior year’s net sales of the licensed products. If United fails to spend the required marketing contribution in any calendar year, the deficiency will be paid to Hooters.
 
By law, United can only sell our alcoholic products to licensed United States wholesalers or distributors. Wholesalers and distributors then sell the product to licensed retailers for “on” or “off” premise consumption. An “on” premise retailer is an establishment where the alcohol is consumed, such as a bar or restaurant, and an “off” premise retailer is an establishment where alcohol is sold for consumption elsewhere, such as a liquor store or, in some state, a supermarket. Accordingly, our products are shipped to the United States by United either directly to its distributors or to United’s warehouse. Products that are shipped to United’s warehouse are then shipped via ground freight to wholesalers or distributors to fulfill orders as they are placed. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
United presently has registered trademarks in the United States associated with our BiVi and BellaSprizz brands or products. In addition, Richard DeCicco, our controlling shareholder, President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Director, owns the rights to a trademark depicting an image of the Botticelli Venus that is used on certain or our Bellissima and Bella Sprizz products. We use these trademarks with the permission of United and Mr. DeCicco.

9



Our other brands, such as Bellissima Prosecco and Sparkling Wines or Hooters branded spirits, are either protected under trademarks owned by the licensors or under common law use, and we use them with the licensors permission pursuant to the agreements that we or our subsidiaries have entered into with them.
 
We intend to apply for new trademarks on an ongoing basis as we develop new brands or products. We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and similar intellectual property as very important to our business.
 
We enforce and protect our trademark rights against third parties infringing or denigrating our trademarks by opposing registration of infringing trademarks, and initiating litigation as necessary.
 
Competition
 
The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength, as well as providing consumers with unique brands with special attributes that set our brands apart from the rest. Our beverage alcohol products compete with other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, some of which have greater resources than we do. Our competitors include, but are not limited to, Gallo, Mionetto, Gruppo Campari, Constellation Brands, William Grant and Sons and Jim Beam Brands.
Governmental Regulation of the Wine and Spirits Industry
 
The production and sale of wine and spirits is subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and state liquor commissions and agencies.
 
In addition, most states in which our wines and spirits are sold impose varying excise taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages. Prompted by growing government budget shortfalls and public reaction against alcohol abuse, government entities often consider legislation that could potentially affect the taxation of alcoholic beverages. Excise tax rates being considered are often substantial. The ultimate effects of such legislation, if passed, cannot be assessed accurately. Any increase in the taxes imposed on wines and spirits can be expected to have a potentially adverse impact on overall sales of such products. However, the impact may not be proportionate to that experienced by distributors of other alcoholic beverages and may not be the same in every state.
 
The agreements we have in place with United and Dan Kay International provide the required licensing conduits that allow us to capture the sales relative to alcoholic beverages in the United States. The United States alcohol beverage business is based upon what is known as a “three-tier system.” The three tiers consist of an import or supplier tier if the product is domestically produced. The second tier is the wholesale tier. The third tier is known as the retail tier, consisting of an on and off premise split. The import/supply tier sells to the wholesale tier that then sells to the retail tier.
 
United possesses the import/supply tier licensing as well as the required licenses in the states where we sell alcoholic beverages to the wholesale tier. We have contracted with United Spirits to facilitate the sales of the products using the licensing United Spirits has in place. This is a common third party provider relationship in the United States alcohol beverage business.
 
Dan-Kay International is the company that we contract warehousing services for the alcohol beverage products that come to rest in the United States. Dan-Kay maintains a required New York State warehousing license. This license has a level allowing the third party warehousing classified as “product of others.”
 
Employees
 
As of March 15, 2021, we employed a total of five full-time employees and two consultants. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
