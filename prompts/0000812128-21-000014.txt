Item 1.    Business
(a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGISTRANT’S BUSINESS
Sanderson Farms was incorporated in Mississippi in 1955, and is a fully, vertically-integrated poultry processing company engaged in the production, processing, marketing and distribution of fresh and frozen chicken products. In addition, the Company is engaged in the processing, marketing and distribution of processed and minimally prepared chicken.
The Company sells ice-packed, chill-packed, bulk-packed and frozen chicken, in whole, cut-up and boneless form, primarily under the Sanderson Farms® brand name, to retailers, distributors, and casual dining operators in the United States and to customers who resell frozen chicken into export markets. During fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, the Company processed approximately 661 million chickens, or approximately 4.9 billion dressed pounds. According to 2021 industry statistics, the Company was the third largest processor of dressed chicken in the United States based on average weekly processed pounds.
The Company's fresh and frozen chicken operations presently encompass 11 hatcheries, 9 feed mills, 12 processing plants and 1 prepared chicken plant. The Company has contracts with operators of approximately 813 grow-out farms and 232 breeder farms that provide it with sufficient housing capacity for its current operations. 
The Company’s prepared chicken product line includes approximately 48 institutional and consumer-packaged, partially cooked or marinated chicken items that it sells nationally, primarily to distributors and food service establishments. A majority of the prepared chicken items are made to the specifications of food service users.
Since the Company completed the initial public offering of its common stock in May 1987, we have significantly expanded operations by expanding existing facilities, adding second shifts and constructing new facilities to increase production capacity, product lines and marketing flexibility. Since 1992, when the Company sold approximately 361.4 million pounds of product, the Company has constructed 8 new hatcheries, 6 new feed mills and 8 new processing plants. As a result of our expansion efforts, the Company's production capacity has significantly increased, and in fiscal 2021 the Company sold approximately 4.9 billion pounds of product, which includes approximately 111.0 million pounds from its prepared chicken plant. 
The Company changed its marketing strategy in 1997 to move away from growing small-sized birds serving primarily the fast food industry to concentrate its production on medium-sized and larger-sized birds serving the retail grocery and food service industries, respectively. This shift resulted in larger average bird weights of the chickens processed by the Company, and substantially increased the number of pounds processed by the Company. In addition, the Company continually evaluates internal and external expansion opportunities to continue its growth in poultry and/or related food products.
The Company is a party to a revolving credit facility dated April 23, 2021, with a maximum available borrowing capacity of $1.0 billion. Under the credit facility, the Company may not exceed a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of 50%. The Company has a one-time right, at any time during the term of the agreement, to increase the maximum debt to total capitalization ratio then in effect by five absolute percentage points in connection with the construction of a new poultry complex for the four fiscal quarters beginning on the first day of the fiscal quarter during which the Company gives written notice of its intent to exercise this right. The Company has not exercised this right. The facility also sets a minimum net worth requirement that at October 31, 2021, was $1.2 billion. The credit is unsecured and, unless extended, will expire on April 23, 2026. As of October 31, 2021, and December 20, 2021, the Company had no outstanding borrowings and had approximately $24.1 million outstanding in letters of credit, leaving $975.9 million of borrowing capacity available under the facility. For more information about the facility, see Item 1.01 of our Current Report on Form 8-K filed April 28, 2021.
(c) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF REGISTRANT’S BUSINESS
General
The Company is engaged in the production, processing, marketing and distribution of fresh and frozen chicken and the preparation, processing, marketing and distribution of processed and minimally prepared chicken items. The Company has one reporting segment, poultry products. 
The Company sells chill-packed, ice-packed, bulk-packed and frozen chicken, in whole, cut-up and boneless form, primarily under the Sanderson Farms® brand name, to retailers, distributors and casual dining operators in the United States and to customers who resell frozen chicken into export markets. During its fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, the Company processed approximately 661 million chickens, or approximately 4.9 billion dressed pounds. According to 2021 industry statistics, the Company was the third largest processor of dressed chicken in the United States based on average weekly processed pounds.
The Company conducts its chicken operations through Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Production Division) and Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Processing Division), both of which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Sanderson Farms, Inc. The production subsidiary, Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Production Division), which has facilities in Laurel, Collins, Hazlehurst and McComb, Mississippi; Bryan, Waco, Palestine, Freestone County, Robertson County, Lindale and Mineola, Texas; Adel, Georgia; and Kinston and Lumberton, North Carolina, is engaged in the production of chickens to the broiler stage. Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Processing Division), which has facilities in Laurel, Collins, Hazlehurst and McComb, Mississippi; Hammond, Louisiana; Bryan, Palestine, Waco and Smith County, Texas; Moultrie, Georgia; and Kinston and St. Pauls, North Carolina, is engaged in the processing, sale and distribution of chicken products.
The Company conducts its prepared chicken business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Foods Division), which has a facility in Flowood, Mississippi. This facility is engaged in the processing, marketing and distribution of approximately 48 processed and minimally prepared chicken items, which it sells nationally, principally to distributors and national food service accounts. The facility is managed by the same senior management team that manages our Processing Division. 
Products
The Company has the ability to produce a wide range of processed chicken products and prepared chicken items.
Processed chicken is first salable as an ice-packed, whole chicken. The Company adds value to its ice-packed, whole chickens by removing the giblets, cutting and deboning the product based on customer specifications, and weighing, packaging and labeling the product to specific customer requirements. The additional processing steps of giblet removal, cutting and close tolerance weighing increase the value of the product to the customer over whole, ice-packed chickens by reducing customer handling and cutting labor and capital costs, reducing the shrinkage associated with cutting, and ensuring consistently sized portions.
The Company adds additional value to the processed chicken by deep chilling and packaging whole chickens in bags or combinations of fresh chicken parts, including boneless product, in various sized, individual trays under the Company’s brand name, which then may be weighed and pre-priced, based on each customer’s needs. This chill-pack process increases the value of the product by extending shelf life, reducing customer weighing and packaging labor, and providing the customer 
with a wide variety of products with uniform, well designed packaging, all of which enhance the customer’s ability to merchandise chicken products.
To satisfy some customers’ merchandising needs, the Company freezes the chicken product, which adds value by meeting the customers’ handling, storage, distribution and marketing needs and by permitting shipment of product overseas where transportation time may be as long as 60 days.
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the contribution, as a percentage of net sales dollars, of each of the Company’s major product lines:

Markets and Pricing
The three largest customer markets in the fresh and frozen chicken industry are food service customers that purchase fresh, bulk-packed products produced from a relatively large bird; retail grocery store customers that purchase fresh, tray-packed products produced from a medium-sized bird; and quick-serve food service customers that purchase products produced from relatively small birds.
The following table sets forth, as of October 31, 2021, for each of the Company’s poultry processing plants, the general customer market to which the plant is devoted, the weekly capacity of each plant at full capacity expressed in number of head processed, and the industry's average size of birds processed in the relevant market:
Plant Location | Market | Capacity Per Week | Industry Bird Size
Laurel, Mississippi | Big Bird | 650,000 | | 9.18
Hammond, Louisiana | Big Bird | 650,000 | | 9.18
Collins, Mississippi | Big Bird | 1,300,000 | | 9.18
Waco, Texas | Big Bird | 1,300,000 | | 9.18
Palestine, Texas | Big Bird | 1,300,000 | | 9.18
St. Pauls, North Carolina | Big Bird | 1,300,000 | | 9.18

Tyler, Texas | Chill-Pack Retail | 1,300,000 | | 6.71

Note 1 - At our investor day on October 16, 2020, we announced our intention to reduce the target live weight for our Hazlehurst, Mississippi plant from a big bird size to a chill-pack retail size for the purpose of meeting shifting demand needs, primarily as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and its effects on consumer buying patterns. On approximately November 23, 2020, the live birds processed at the Hazlehurst, Mississippi plant reached our target live weight for chill-pack retail sized birds. Much of the product processed there is subsequently transferred to a chill-pack retail plant to be packaged and sold to chill-pack retail customers.
Our big bird plants process a relatively large bird. The chicken products produced at these plants are generally sold as fresh, bulk-packed chicken cut into a variety of products, including boneless breast meat, chicken tenders, whole and cut wings and boneless thigh meat, and are sold primarily to food service customers and further processors at negotiated spreads from quoted commodity market prices for those products. We have long-term contracts with many of our customers for these products produced at our big bird plants, but prices for products sold pursuant to those contracts fluctuate based on quoted commodity market prices. The contracts do not require the customers to purchase, or the Company to sell, any specific quantity of product. The dark meat from these birds that is not deboned is sold primarily as leg quarters and drumsticks in the export market or as fresh whole legs to further processors. While we have long-standing relationships with many of our export partners, virtually all of our export sales are at negotiated or spot commodity prices, which prices exhibit fluctuations typical of commodity markets. We have few long-term contracts for this product. 
As of December 20, 2021, the Company had the capacity to process 6.5 million head per week in its big bird plants. Our results from these plants are materially affected by fluctuations in the commodity market prices for boneless breast meat, chicken tenders, wings, leg quarters and boneless thigh meat as quoted by Urner Barry.
Urner Barry is an independent company specializing in the timely, accurate and independent reporting on market news and market price quotations to its customers in various food and protein industries, including poultry. The Urner Barry spot market prices for boneless breast meat, chicken tenders, leg quarters, whole wings and boneless thigh meat for the past five calendar years are set forth below and are published with Urner Barry's permission. Realized prices will not necessarily equal quoted market prices since most contracts offer negotiated discounts to quoted market prices, which discounts are negotiated on a customer by customer basis and are influenced by many factors. Selection of a particular market price benchmark is largely customer driven:
Our chill-pack plants process medium sized birds and cut and package the product in various sized individual trays to customers’ specifications. The trays are weighed and pre-priced primarily for customers to resell through retail grocery outlets. The Company sells its chill-pack products both under store brand names and under the Company’s Sanderson Farms® brand name. The Company has contracts ranging in duration from one year to three years with most of its chill-pack customers. These agreements typically provide for the pricing of product based on agreed upon, flat prices or on negotiated formulas that use an agreed upon, regularly quoted market price as the base, as well as various other guidelines for the relationship between the parties. All of our contracts with retail grocery store customers also provide for the sale of negotiated quantities of product at periodically negotiated prices, rather than the flat and formula-driven prices discussed above. None of our contracts with retail grocery store customers require the customers to purchase, or the Company to sell, any specific quantity of product. As of December 20, 2021, the Company had the capacity to process 7.15 million head per week at its chill-pack and chill-pack feeder plants. Our results from our chill-pack plants are materially affected by our pricing negotiations with customers and fluctuations in certain market benchmarks.
As with products produced at our big bird plants, selection of the desired methodology for pricing chill-pack products is largely customer driven. Currently, many of our chill-pack customers choose to negotiate flat prices for the life of the contracts, while some of our customers choose to use an index published by Express Markets, Inc. ("EMI"). 
Currently, most of the products sold by our prepared chicken plant are sold under long-term contracts at fixed prices related to the spot commodity price of chicken at the time the contract is negotiated, plus a premium for additional processing.
Sales and Marketing
The Company’s chicken products are sold primarily to retailers (including national and regional supermarket chains and local supermarkets) and distributors within the United States. The Company also sells its chicken products to casual dining operators, foreign customers, and United States based customers who resell the products outside of the continental United States. This wide range of customers, together with the Company’s product mix, provides the Company with flexibility in responding to changing market conditions in its effort to maximize profits. This flexibility also assists the Company in its efforts to reduce its exposure to market volatility, although its ability to do so is limited.
Sales and distribution of the Company’s chicken products are conducted primarily by sales personnel at the general corporate offices in Laurel, Mississippi, by customer service representatives at each of its processing plants and its prepared chicken plant and through independent food brokers. Each plant has individual on-site distribution centers and uses contract carriers for distribution of its products.
Generally, the Company prices much of its chicken products based upon weekly and daily market prices reported by private firms such as EMI and Urner Barry. The Company’s profitability is affected by such market prices, which may fluctuate substantially and exhibit cyclical and seasonal characteristics. The Company will adjust base prices depending upon value added, volume, product mix and other factors. While base prices may change weekly and daily, the Company’s adjustments to those base prices are generally negotiated from time to time with customers. The Company’s sales are generally made on an as-ordered basis, and the Company maintains sales contracts ranging in duration from one year to three years with many of its customers. These agreements, which provide the pricing structure of product, as well as various other guidelines for the relationship between the parties, do not require the customers to purchase or the Company to sell any specific quantity of product. 
From time to time, the Company may use television, radio and newspaper advertising, point of purchase material, social media and other marketing techniques to develop consumer awareness of and brand recognition for its Sanderson Farms® products. We have achieved a high level of public awareness and acceptance of our products in our core markets. Brand awareness is an important element of our marketing philosophy, and we intend to continue brand name merchandising of our products. During calendar 2004, the Company launched an advertising campaign designed to distinguish the Company’s fresh chicken products from competitors’ products. The campaign noted that the Company’s product is a natural product free from salt, water and other additives that some competitors inject into their fresh chicken. The Company continues to use various media to communicate this message today. During fiscal 2016, the Company launched a multi-media advertising campaign designed to explain and support the Company's position regarding the judicious use of antibiotics to prevent illness and treat chickens that become ill. During fiscal 2017, the Company launched a multi-media advertising campaign designed to dispel many of the myths about poultry production. 
While the information presented in the campaigns launched in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 is still available on our website, the Company launched a new multi-media campaign in fiscal 2018 designed to educate consumers on key attributes of our products. In fiscal year 2019, the Company's marketing efforts were primarily focused on digital campaigns that provided new, easily accessible recipes and highlighted the relatively high protein content of poultry. In fiscal 2020, the Company quickly shifted its marketing efforts to adapt to challenges that arose as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on providing supportive and meaningful digital content for the evolving digital shopper. The lasting effects of the pandemic, including the rise of the home chef, led the Company to shift its consumer messaging toward inspiration and convenience during fiscal 2021. This strategy included updating the Company's website and social media content, publishing several recipe videos and shoppable recipes, providing QR codes on retail packaging, which direct consumers to recipes relevant to the particular product, and amplifying our presence on digital retail shelves. The Company regularly evaluates consumer trends, preferences, perception and awareness of its brand and, while not currently advertising on television, expects to continue to use extensions of previous campaigns and to develop new and relevant content in other media, at least for the near term. 
The Company’s prepared chicken items are sold nationally, primarily to distributors and national food service accounts. Sales of such products are handled by sales personnel of the Company and by independent food brokers. Prepared chicken items are distributed from the Company’s plant in Flowood, Mississippi, through arrangements with contract carriers.
Production and Facilities
General. The Company is a fully, vertically-integrated producer of fresh, frozen and minimally prepared chicken products, controlling the production of hatching eggs, hatching, feed manufacturing, growing, processing and packaging of its product lines.
Breeding and Hatching. The Company maintains its own breeder flocks for the production of hatching eggs. Such breeder flocks are acquired as one-day old chicks (known as pullets and cockerels) from primary breeding companies that specialize in the production of genetically designed breeder stock. As of October 31, 2021, the Company maintained contracts with 70 independent contract pullet producers for the grow-out of pullets (growing the pullet to the point at which it is capable of egg production, which takes approximately six months). Thereafter, the mature breeder flocks are transported by the Company’s vehicles to breeder farms that are maintained, as of October 31, 2021, by 162 independent contract producers under the Company’s supervision. Eggs produced on the farms of independent contract breeder producers are transported to the Company’s hatcheries in Company-owned vehicles.
The Company owns and operates eleven hatcheries located in Mississippi, Texas, Georgia and North Carolina where eggs are incubated, vaccinated and hatched in a process requiring 21 days. The chicks are vaccinated against common poultry diseases and are transported by the Company’s vehicles to independent contract grow-out farms. As of October 31, 2021, the Company’s hatcheries were capable of producing an aggregate of approximately 14.3 million chicks per week.
Grow-out. The Company places its chicks on the farms of 813 independent contract broiler producers, as of October 31, 2021, located in Mississippi, Texas, Georgia and North Carolina, where broilers are grown to an age of approximately seven to nine weeks. The farms provide the Company with sufficient housing capacity for its operations, and are typically family-owned farms operated under contract with the Company. The farm owners provide facilities, utilities and labor; the Company supplies the day-old chicks, feed and veterinary and technical services. The independent contract poultry producers are compensated pursuant to an incentive formula designed to promote production cost efficiency.
Historically, the Company has been able to accommodate expansion in grow-out facilities through additional contract arrangements with independent contract producers.
Feed Mills. An important factor in the grow-out of chickens is the rate at which chickens convert feed into body weight. The Company purchases primary feed ingredients on the open market. Ingredients include corn and soybean meal, which are the largest cost components of the Company’s total feed costs. The quality and composition of the feed are critical to the conversion rate, and accordingly, we formulate and produce our own feed. As of October 31, 2021, the Company operated nine feed mills, four of which are located in Mississippi, three in Texas, one in Georgia and one in North Carolina. The Company’s annual feed requirements for fiscal 2021 were approximately 5.0 million tons, and it has the capacity to produce approximately 6.6 million tons of finished feed annually under current configurations.
Feed grains are commodities subject to volatile price changes caused by weather, size of harvest, transportation and storage costs, domestic and export demand and the agricultural and energy policies of the United States and foreign governments. On October 31, 2021, the Company had the capacity to store approximately 4.4 million bushels of corn at its feed mills, which was sufficient to store approximately one week's requirements for corn. Generally, the Company purchases corn and other feed ingredients at current prices from suppliers and, to a limited extent, directly from farmers. Feed grains are available from an adequate number of sources. Although the Company has not experienced and does not anticipate problems in securing adequate supplies of feed grains, price fluctuations of feed grains have a direct and material effect upon the Company’s profitability. Although we attempt to manage the risk of volatile price changes in grain markets by sometimes purchasing grain at current prices for future delivery, we cannot eliminate the potentially adverse effect of grain price increases.
Processing. Once broilers reach processing weight, they are transported in Company vehicles to the Company’s processing plants. These plants use modern, highly automated equipment to process and package the chickens. The Company’s McComb and Collins, Mississippi; Moultrie, Georgia; Kinston and St. Pauls, North Carolina and Bryan, Waco, Palestine and Tyler, Texas processing plants operate two processing lines on a double shift basis with the capacity to process 
approximately 1,300,000 chickens per week as of October 31, 2021. The Company’s Laurel and Hazlehurst, Mississippi and Hammond, Louisiana processing plants operate on a double shift basis with the capacity to process approximately 650,000 chickens per week as of October 31, 2021. At October 31, 2021, the Company’s deboning facilities had the capacity to produce approximately 18.4 million pounds of big bird boneless breast and tenders finished product and 13.5 million pounds of chill-pack boneless breast and tenders finished product each week.
Prepared Chicken. The Company's prepared chicken plant is located in Flowood, Mississippi and has approximately 85,000 square feet of refrigerated manufacturing and storage space. The plant uses highly automated equipment to prepare, process and freeze prepared chicken items.
Executive Offices; Other Facilities. The Company’s laboratory and corporate offices are located on separate sites in Laurel, Mississippi. The office buildings house the Company’s corporate offices, meeting facilities and computer equipment and constitute the corporate headquarters. As of October 31, 2021, the Company operated 16 automotive maintenance shops, which service over 1,400 over-the-road and farm vehicles used to support the Company's operations. In addition, the Company has one child care facility located near its Collins, Mississippi processing plant, which, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was temporarily closed as of October 31, 2021.
Quality Control
The Company believes that quality control is important to its business and conducts quality control activities throughout all aspects of its operations. The Company believes these activities are beneficial to efficient production and in ensuring its customers receive wholesome, high quality products.
The Company's Director of Technical Services supervises the operation of a laboratory in Laurel, Mississippi which, among other things, monitors sanitation at the hatcheries, monitors the quality and purity of feed ingredients and feed, monitors the health of the Company’s breeder and broiler flocks, and conducts microbiological tests on live chickens, facilities and finished products. The Company conducts on-site quality control activities at each of its twelve processing plants and the prepared chicken plant.
Regulation
The Company’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, including, but not limited to, the Federal Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and corresponding state agencies. The Company’s chicken processing plants are subject to continuous on-site inspection by the USDA, and the Company's prepared chicken plant operates under the USDA’s Total Quality Control Program, which is a strict self-inspection plan written in cooperation with and monitored by the USDA. The FDA inspects the production at the Company’s feed mills.
Compliance with existing regulations has not had a material adverse effect upon the our earnings or competitive position in the past. Management believes that the Company is in substantial compliance with existing laws and regulations relating to the operation of its facilities and does not know of any major capital expenditures necessary to comply with such statutes and regulations.
The Company takes extensive precautions to ensure that its flocks are healthy and that its processing plants and other facilities operate in a healthy and environmentally sound manner. Events beyond our control, however, such as an outbreak of disease in its flocks or the adoption by governmental agencies of more stringent regulations, could materially and adversely affect operations.
Competition
The Company is subject to significant competition from regional and national firms in all markets in which it competes. Some of the Company's competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than the Company.
The primary methods of competition are price, product quality, number of products offered, brand awareness and customer service. The Company has emphasized product quality and brand awareness through its advertising strategy. See “Business — Sales and Marketing.” Although poultry is relatively inexpensive in comparison with other meats, the Company 
competes indirectly with the producers of other meats and fish, since changes in the relative prices of these foods may alter consumer buying patterns.
Customers
Two customers each accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated sales for the years ended October 31, 2021, October 31, 2020, and October 31, 2019. Sales to the two customers in fiscal 2021 accounted for 16.4% and 12.5%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net sales, in 2020 accounted for 12.7% and 14.9%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net sales, and in fiscal 2019 accounted for 15.8% and 11.8%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated net sales. The Company does not believe the loss of these or any other single customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company because it could sell poultry earmarked for any single customer to alternative customers at market prices.
Sources of Supply
During fiscal 2021, the Company purchased its pullets and cockerels from a single major breeder. The Company has found the genetic breeds or cross breeds supplied by this company produce chickens most suitable to the Company’s purposes. During fiscal 2021, we had no written contracts with this breeder for the supply of breeder stock. Other sources of breeder stock are available, and we continually evaluate these sources of supply.
Should breeder stock from our current supplier not be available for any reason, we believe that we could obtain adequate breeder stock from other suppliers.
Other major raw materials used by the Company include feed grains and other feed ingredients, cooking ingredients and packaging materials. We purchase these materials from a number of vendors and believe that our sources of supply are adequate for current needs. We do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining these materials in the future.
Seasonality
The demand for the Company’s chicken products generally is greatest during the spring and summer months and lowest during the winter months.
Trademarks
The Company has registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office the trademark Sanderson Farms®, which it uses in connection with the distribution of its prepared chicken and premium grade chill-pack products. We consider the protection of this trademark to be important to our marketing efforts due to consumer awareness of and loyalty to the Sanderson Farms® label. The Company also has registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office six other trademarks that are used in connection with the distribution of chicken and other products and for other competitive purposes.
The Company, over the years, has developed important non-public proprietary information regarding product-related matters. While we have internal safeguards and procedures to protect the confidentiality of such information, we do not generally seek patent protection for its technology.
Human Capital Resources
As of October 31, 2021, the Company had 17,662 employees. Of these, 2,021 employees were salaried and 15,641 were hourly. A collective bargaining agreement with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCWIU) covers 661 hourly employees at our processing plant in Hammond, Louisiana and expires on November 30, 2022. A collective bargaining agreement with UFCWIU covers 1,645 production, maintenance and clean-up employees at our Bryan, Texas processing facility and expires on December 31, 2023. We believe our overall relations with our workforce are very good.
Our Culture and Values.  Our company culture is the cornerstone of all our human capital programs. We believe our culture, which is based upon our core value of respect for the inherent dignity, equality and worth of every human being, is a key reason for our success. It is enshrined in our corporate Statement of Philosophy, first drafted in 1969, and in our Company Vision, Statement on Human Rights and Corporate Code of Conduct. In particular, our Company Vision calls 
upon our team to treat all persons with absolute respect and integrity and to be devoted to the success of everyone in our organization in fulfilling their potential in all aspects of life.
Safety and Health. The safety, health and welfare of our employees are paramount to our company. Our occupational health and safety programs are overseen by our President’s safety committee, which meets quarterly to set specific goals for workplace safety and measure attainment of those goals. We have five safety and health services team members who hold the Certified Safety Professional (CSP) designation from the Board of Certified Safety Professionals, and one of the five also holds the Occupational Hygiene and Safety Technician designation. Although we have opened four new poultry complexes and added more than 7,800 employees since October 31, 2010, our OSHA injury rates have declined by over 28% during that time. In fiscal year 2019, our OSHA injury rates declined by approximately 21% compared to fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2020, our OSHA injury rates declined another 6% compared to 2019, and in fiscal 2021, our rates declined another 4% compared to fiscal 2020. Cumulatively for the five years ended October 31, 2021, we had the fewest OSHA citations per 1,000 employees of any company in our industry having more than 5,000 employees.
We work closely with ergonomists to continuously monitor our employees’ working conditions and implement measures to ensure their wellness. For example, we have set our processing line speeds at the lowest rate of any company in our industry to reduce employee stress and injuries. This also contributes to favorable yields and product quality. We have numerous programs to promote the overall good health and wellness of our workforce. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, we implemented extensive safety measures throughout our company during fiscal 2020 to protect our employees from COVID-19, and we continued many of those measures throughout fiscal 2021. These measures are described in detail in this report in "Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI"). We strive to foster a work environment that includes and embraces racial, ethnic and gender diversity and other individual differences. As of the end of fiscal year 2021, 45% of our total workforce were women and 87% were minorities. Additionally, 24% of our management team were women and 42% were minorities. During fiscal year 2021, 45% of our new hires were women and 90% of our new hires were minorities. Our management diversity committee, which was established in 2011, oversees and strategically plans for diversity and inclusion within our company. For example, the committee has expanded our long-standing recruitment program targeted at Historically Black Colleges and Universities ("HBCUs"), and in fiscal 2021, 15% of the company’s summer interns were recruited from HBCUs. In fiscal 2020, the committee formed a new steering committee as a grassroots, action-oriented team to champion positive change. Additionally, our board of directors formed a special board committee on DEI, whose initial task was to engage an independent DEI consultant to perform a top to bottom review of our goals, strategy, policies, practices and messaging on DEI. We have a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and harassment and have several systems under which employees can report incidents confidentially or anonymously and without fear of reprisal.
Recruitment, Retention and Development.  The primary way we recruit and retain employees is by ensuring that our compensation and benefits are the most competitive in our industry. In fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021 we awarded our hourly workforce across-the-board pay increases that we believe make our wages very competitive in the markets in which we operate. Our progressive pay scale now begins at $16.70 per hour. After one year of employment, employees participate in our employee stock ownership plan at no cost to them and we match 100% of their contributions to our 401(k) plan for the first 3% of salary contributed and 50% for the next 2% of salary contributed. We pay 75% of the premium cost of our health insurance plan for employees and their families. We also have an extensive training program that provides both hourly and management training and other opportunities for professional and personal development and mentorship. Our training program is a critical part of our focus on employee safety, operational efficiency, employee wellness and welfare and our corporate culture. We invested $2.5 million in our employee training and development programs in fiscal 2021.
