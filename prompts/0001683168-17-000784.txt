ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
THE BUSINESS
 
Recent Acquisitions
 
On December 8, 2016, the Company completed the purchase (the “EcoVillage Acquisition”) of all of the assets of JPF Venture Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“JPF”), used primarily in connection with the business of JPF consisting of the development of a sustainable living community by creating an ecologically sustainable “EcoVillage” powered by 100% fossil-fuel free electricity, buildings cooled by energy efficient and chemical free systems, and on-site water produced for drinking, aquaculture and agriculture (the “JPF Assets”), pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement by and between the Company and JPF dated December 8, 2016 (the “JPF Purchase Agreement”). The JPF Assets purchased, primarily used in the Company’s business, includes designs, conceptual plans, blueprints, drawings, sketches, outlines, maps, plots, diagrams, drafts, representations, schemes, models and other similar items related to the business. JPF is an entity owned and controlled by Jeremy Feakins, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. Please see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 12, 2016 for more information.
 
On March 1, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“OTE”). OTE is engaged in the business of developing deep-water hydrothermal technologies to provide renewable energy and drinking water. OTE’s Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (“OTEC”) and Sea Water Air Conditioning (“SWAC”) technologies are designed to take advantage of the difference between cold deep water and warmer surface water to produce hydrothermal energy without requiring fossil fuels. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, a newly-created Delaware corporation that is wholly-owned by TetriDyn (“TetriDyn Merger Sub”) will merge with and into OTE (the “Merger”) with OTE continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of TetriDyn. Please see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 10, 2017 for more information.
 
Nature of the Business
 
We currently are in the business of facilitating the development of sustainable living communities by creating ecologically sustainable “EcoVillages” powered by 100% fossil-fuel free electricity, buildings cooled by energy efficient and chemical free systems, and on-site water produced for drinking, aquaculture and agriculture. Upon consummation of the Merger with OTE, we also expect to expand our business to engage in the development of OTEC and SWAC:
 

· | Ocean Thermal Electrical Conversion, known in our industry as OTEC, power plants are designed to produce electricity. In addition, some of the seawater running through an OTEC plant can be desalinated efficiently, producing fresh water for agriculture and human consumption.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Seawater Air Conditioning, known in our industry as SWAC, plants are designed to use cold water from ocean depths to provide air conditioning for large commercial buildings or other facilities. This same technology can also use deep cold water from lakes, known as Lake Water Air Conditioning or LWAC.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We expect to use OTE’s technology in the development of our EcoVillages, which we expect will add significant value to our existing line of business.
 
Prior to the EcoVillage Acquisition, the Company specialized in providing business information technology (IT) solutions to our customers through the optimization of business and IT processes by using systems engineering methodologies, strategic planning, and system integration to add efficiency and value to our customers’ business processes and to help our customers identify critical success factors in their business.
 
Services and Products
 
We are currently focusing our efforts on developing and commercializing our EcoVillages, as well as working to develop or acquire new complementary assets. Subject to the consummation of the OTE Merger, we expect that OTE’s OTEC/SWAC technologies will be used in the development of our EcoVillages and will add significant value to our existing line of business.

EcoVillages
 
Ecovillages are communities whose goal is to become more socially, economically and ecologically sustainable. Ecovillages are communities whose inhabitants seek to live according to ecological principles, causing as little impact on the environment as possible. We expect that our EcoVillage communities will range from a population of 50 to 150 individuals, although some may be smaller. We may also form larger EcoVillages of up to 2,000 individuals that will be formed as networks of smaller sub-communities. We expect that our EcoVillages will grow by the addition of individuals, families, or other small groups.
 
Our EcoVillages will offer small-scale communities with minimal ecological impact, or regenerative impacts as an alternative. We are targeting “ecovillagers” that are united by shared ecological, social-economic and cultural-spiritual values to become members of our EcoVillage communities. Specifically, our targeted ecovillagers are those that seek alternatives to ecologically destructive electrical, water, transportation, and waste-treatment systems, as well as the larger social systems that mirror and support them. We believe that many people see the breakdown of traditional forms of community, wasteful consumerist lifestyles, the destruction of natural habitat, urban sprawl, factory farming, and over-reliance on fossil fuels as trends that must be changed to avert ecological disaster and create richer and more fulfilling ways of life. We intend to design our EcoVillages to provide an alternative to traditional forms of community and attract ecovillagers who share in our belief in intentional living.
 
The Company is in the process of evaluating, and intends to acquire and operate, mixed-use, commercial and/or residential real estate properties located throughout the United States, the Caribbean and elsewhere as sites for the development of our EcoVillages. In addition to our acquisition of OTE and the OTEC/SWAC technology, the Company is evaluating potential target assets and may pursue other acquisition opportunities thereafter in order to strengthen its existing line of business.
 
Research and Development
 
We incurred no costs for research and development for our operations during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe our intellectual properties will be critical to our business and growth. We rely on trade secret protection; confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, customers, and others with whom we interact; and patent laws to protect our proprietary rights. However, we do not believe that our EcoVillages business segment is dependent upon, or obtains a competitive advantage from, any patents or that the expiration of any patent would materially affect our business, notwithstanding the SWAC technology we expect to acquire from OTE upon consummation of the Merger.
 
We frequently review our research and development efforts and product identification needs to consider whether we should seek additional patent or trademark protection for new developments or product offerings. We may seek patent protection for any novel enhancements we may invent.
 
We do not believe that any of our products or other proprietary rights infringe upon the rights of third parties. However, we cannot assure that others may not assert infringement claims against us in the future and recognize that any such assertion may require us to incur legal and other defense costs, enter into compromise royalty arrangements, or terminate the use of some technologies. Further, we may be required to incur legal and other costs to protect our proprietary rights against infringement by third parties.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had one employee, Jeremy P. Feakins, who is employed as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer.
 
Government Regulation; Environmental Compliance
 
Our activities are not subject to present or expected probable material governmental regulation, including environmental laws.
 
Competition
 
While many firms exist in the residential community development market, ultimately how well the Company succeeds is directly related to its own investments and not to the competition. The Company will seek to first serve a niche market that most companies might not otherwise consider, namely the “ecovillage” market. Larger firms tend to focus on larger projects. While the returns may not be as great, they are able to enter the market segment by spending larger amounts of capital, generally not available to the small and medium sized investor. There are relatively few firms targeting customers in our niche demographic; provided, however, some of our competitors include but are not limited to “Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage,” located in Missouri, “Ecovillage at Ithaca,” located in New York, “Twin Oaks Community,” located in Virginia, and “Living Roots Ecovillage,” located in Indiana.

Potential competitors may have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial, technical, marketing, and human resources than we have. As a result, these competitors may:
 

· | succeed in developing communities that are equal to or superior to our communities or that achieve greater market acceptance than our communities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | devote greater resources to developing, marketing, or selling their communities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and technical advances and changes in customer requirements, which could render our technologies and communities obsolete;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | introduce products that make the continued development of our current and future communities uneconomical;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to develop and commercialize our communities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | withstand price competition more successfully than we can;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our prospective customers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily than we can.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Opportunities
 
To diversify risk and provide additional potential sources of revenue while we continue efforts to commercialize our products, principally our EcoVillages at this time, we may seek to identify other opportunities for possible expansion or acquisition. We believe that we may be able to increase the commercial value of other products, technologies, and operations that we may seek through the application of the entrepreneurial, fundraising, management, marketing, and other skills of our management and executives we may recruit. Other than OTE, we have not identified any such target products, technologies, or operations at this time.
 
If we do identify other products, technologies, or operations, we may seek a commercial arrangement through a joint venture or strategic relationship, acquisition, or other arrangement. We may issue common stock and other securities to acquire and fund any such transaction, which may dilute the interests of current stockholders. We cannot assure that our efforts to identify, acquire, and operate any acquired products, technologies, or operations will be successful.

The Certificate of Correction was filed in order to provide for an effective date of the Certificate of Change and provide for a proportionate decrease in the Company’s authorized shares of common stock in connection with the Stock Split, whereby the Company’s total number of authorized shares of common stock shall decrease from 100,000,000 shares of common stock to 400,000 shares of common stock. The December 2016 Reverse Stock Split became effective at 12:01 am on December 31, 2016 and became effective with FINRA (the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) and in the marketplace at the open of business on March 28, 2017 (the “Effective Date”), whereupon the shares of common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis. The Company had also requested a new ticker symbol in connection with the purchase of the JPF Assets and the Company’s new business direction.

Events Subsequent to the End of the 2016 Fiscal Year
 
Effectiveness of Reverse Stock Split with FINRA
 
On December 5, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an action to effectuate a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company on a 1-for-250 basis (the “December Reverse Stock Split”). The December Reverse Stock Split was effected by the Company filing a Certificate of Change Pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes Section 78.209 (the “Certificate of Change”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on December 6, 2016, and a Certificate of Correction (the “Certificate of Correction”) to the Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on December 15, 2016. The Certificate of Correction was filed in order to provide for an effective date of the Certificate of Change and provide for a proportionate decrease in the Company’s authorized shares of common stock in connection with the December Reverse Stock Split, whereby the Company’s total number of authorized shares of common stock shall decrease from 100,000,000 shares of common stock to 400,000 shares of common stock..

The December Reverse Stock Split and decrease in authorized shares became effective with the Secretary of State of Nevada at 12:01 am on December 31, 2016 and the Company received FINRA (the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) approval on March 28, 2017. Per share and weighted average amounts have been retroactively restated in the accompanying financial statements and related notes to reflect this stock split. The Company has also requested a new ticker symbol in connection with the purchase of the Assets and the Company’s new business direction.
 
The Company was authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock. As a result of the Stock Split, the Company will be authorized to issue 400,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2016, there were 246,616 shares (post-December Reverse Stock Split) of common stock outstanding. The December Reverse Stock Split does not have any effect on the stated par value of the common stock.
 
Immediately after the December Reverse Stock Split, each stockholder’s percentage ownership interest in the Company and proportional voting power has remain virtually unchanged except for minor changes and adjustments that will result from rounding fractional shares into whole shares. The rights and privileges of the holders of shares of common stock will be substantially unaffected by the December Reverse Stock Split.
 
Name Change
 
On January 6, 2017, the Board of Directors approved an Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to change our corporate name from TetriDyn Solutions, Inc. to Eco Development Co. in order to better reflect the Company business subsequent to its acquisition of all assets of Seller used primarily in connection with the business of Seller consisting of the development of sustainable living communities by creating ecologically sustainable “EcoVillages” powered by 100% fossil-fuel free electricity, buildings cooled by energy efficient and chemical free systems, and on-site water produced for drinking, aquaculture and agriculture (the “Assets”), pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, as previously reported in the December Form 8-K. The principal purpose for changing our corporate name is to convey more clearly a sense of our new business direction, which is to develop sustainable living communities by creating ecologically sustainable “EcoVillages” powered by 100% fossil-fuel free electricity, buildings cooled by energy efficient and chemical free systems, and on-site water produced for drinking, aquaculture and agriculture. A Preliminary Schedule 14C was filed with the United States Securities Exchange Commission on January 31, 2017.
Approval to Increase the Number of Authorized Common Stock Shares
 
As of the effective date of the approval by FINRA, the Company will have 400,000 shares of Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized, of which 246,616 shares of Common Stock will be outstanding and no shares of preferred stock will be outstanding. However, on February 28, 2017, the Board of Directors approved an Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized shares of Common Stock from 400,000 to 200,000,000. On March 15, 2017, the Company filed Preliminary Schedule 14C Information with United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The Authorized Share Increase would not change the number of authorized shares of preferred stock.
 
The Authorized Share Increase is intended to facilitate the Company’s efforts to raise capital by making more shares of Common Stock available to the Company for future issuances in connection with the sale of shares to raise additional capital for the Company’s operating needs.
 
The par value of the Common Stock will remain unchanged at $0.001 per share and the Authorized Share Increase will not change the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock under the Articles of Incorporation. Accordingly, the Authorized Share Increase will have the effect of creating additional authorized and unreserved shares of our Common Stock. Although at present we have no current plans, arrangements or understandings providing for the issuance of the additional shares that would be made available for issuance upon effectiveness of the Authorized Share Increase, such additional shares may be used by us for various purposes in the future without further stockholder approval. These purposes may include, among other things:
 

· | the sale of shares to raise additional capital;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | the issuance of equity incentives to our employees, officers or directors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establishment of strategic relationships with other companies and suppliers; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | acquisition of other businesses or products.
--+---------------------------------------------

The Board of Directors is not implementing the share increase in anticipation of any future transaction or series of transactions. Further, the Board of Directors does not intend for this transaction to be the first step in a series of plans or proposals of a “going private transaction” within the meaning of Rule 13e-3 of the Securities Exchange Act.
 
The principal effect of the Authorized Share Increase will be to increase the number of authorized shares. As a result, Stockholders should recognize that once the Authorized Share Increase is in effect, they will own the same number of shares that they currently own. However, the Authorized Share Increase will affect all Stockholders uniformly and will not affect any stockholder’s percentage ownership interest in the Company. The Authorized Share Increase will not affect proportionate voting rights and other rights and preferences of the holders of Common Stock. For example, a holder of 2% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the Authorized Share Increase would continue to hold 2% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately after the Authorized Share Increase. The Authorized Share Increase also will not affect the number of Stockholders of record.
 
Merger and Name Change
 
In January 2017, the Company refocused on the possible merger with Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation, which is developing projects for renewable power generation, desalinated water production, and air conditioning using its proprietary technologies designed to extract energy from the temperature differences between warm surface water and cold deep water. On March 1, 2017, an Agreement and Plan of Merger was entered into between TetriDyn Solutions Inc. and Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation. The intent of entering into such agreement is to achieve the business goals of both companies.
 
In order to effect the combination of the Parties, TetriDyn shall organize a new, wholly owned subsidiary (“MergerCo”) under the laws of the state of Delaware that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the laws governing corporations under the Delaware General Corporation Law (“Delaware Law”), shall merge with and into OTE (the “Merger”) for the purpose of making OTE a wholly owned subsidiary of TetriDyn (the “Surviving Corporation”).
 
In order to effect the Merger, at the Closing TetriDyn shall effect a recapitalization that consists of a 2.1676 forward split of its 246,616 shares of issued and outstanding stock (“TetriDyn Post-Split Stock”).
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger, each share of common stock of OTE issued and outstanding or existing immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined herein) of the Merger (the “OTE Stock”) will be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive one newly issued share of TetriDyn Post-Split Stock (the “New TetriDyn Stock”), subject to certain restrictions on transfer as hereinafter provided and subject to the rights of the holders of certain of such shares of OTE Stock to exercise their rights as dissenters to seek an appraisal of the fair value thereof as provided under Delaware Law (each, a “Dissenting OTE Stockholder”). The number of shares of New TetriDyn Stock issued to the stockholders OTE, including shares that would have been issuable to Dissenting OTE Stockholders (as defined) had they not dissented, together with the number of shares issuable on the exercise of outstanding warrants and the conversion of outstanding bonds of OTE shall constitute, on a fully diluted basis, 90% of the number of shares of common stock of TetriDyn to on a fully-diluted basis after giving effect only to the Merger. The shares of common stock of TetriDyn, par value $0.001 per share (“TetriDyn Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain issued and outstanding. No shares of preferred stock of TetriDyn are issued and outstanding, and TetriDyn has no existing convertible securities or stock equivalent securities convertible or exercisable for shares of TetriDyn preferred Stock.
 
The Board of Directors of each of the Parties has determined that the Merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business strategies of each of them and is fair to, and in the best interests of, each of them and each of their respective stockholders; has approved and adopted this Agreement, the issuance of New TetriDyn Stock, and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and has recommended approval of this Agreement and the contemplated transactions by the appropriate Party’s stockholders when such approval is required by law.
 
For federal income tax purposes, it is understood that the Merger has been structured to qualify as a so-called “tax-free reorganization” under the provisions of Sections 368(a)1(A) and 368(a)(2)(E) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and that each Party will take all actions reasonably necessary to so qualify the Merger, although neither Party has obtained or will be required to obtain or provide an opinion of counsel to the foregoing effect.
 
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with Delaware Law, at the Effective Time, MergerCo shall be merged with and into OTE, the separate corporate existence of MergerCo shall cease, OTE shall continue as the Surviving Corporation of the Merger, and the OTE Stock issued and outstanding or existing immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive shares of New TetriDyn Stock as herein provided.

In connection with the consummation of the Merger and upon the consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding common of TetriDyn as provided in this Agreement, immediately following the Closing, TetriDyn shall file with the Nevada Secretary of State an amendment to its articles of incorporation changing its name to “Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation” or such other name as may be available and acceptable to the Parties and effecting the Recapitalization.
 
On March 9, 2017, a Form 8-K was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission reporting the terms of the Merger.
 
Convertible Notes
 
On February 24, 2017, the Company, completed the amendment of certain convertible promissory notes issued to JPF to eliminate the conversation feature of those notes.
 
Among other convertible promissory notes, JPF holds:
 
(a) a convertible promissory note assigned by the original creditor to JPF on March 12, 2015, in the original principal amount of Three Hundred Ninety Four Thousand Three Hundred Eighty Dollars ($394,380) (the “$394,380 Note”), convertible at the discretion of JPF into a total of 63,102 shares of the Company’s common stock (as adjusted for the Company’s 1-for-250 December Reverse Stock Split);
 
(b) a convertible promissory note issued by the Company to JPF on February 25, 2016, in the original principal amount of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the “February Note”), convertible at the discretion of JPF into a total of 1,666,667 shares of the Company’s common stock (per the terms of this convertible promissory note, these shares are not subject to adjustment for the Company’s 1-for-250 December Reverse Stock Split);
 
(c) a convertible promissory note issued by the Company to JPF on May 20, 2016, in the original principal amount of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the “May Note”), convertible at the discretion of JPF into a total of 1,666,667 shares of the Company’s common stock (per the terms of this convertible promissory note, these shares are not subject to adjustment for the Company’s 1-for-250 December Reverse Stock Split); and
 
(d) a convertible promissory note issued by the Company to JPF on October 20, 2016 in the remaining principal amount of Twelve Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($12,500) (the “October Note”), convertible at the discretion of JPF into a total of 416,667 shares of the Company’s common stock (per the terms of this convertible promissory note, these shares are not subject to adjustment for the Company’s 1-for-250 December Reverse Stock Split).
 
The $394,380 Note, the February Note, the May Note and the October Note are collectively referred to herein as, the “Notes”).
 
Pursuant to that certain Amendment of Promissory Notes dated February 24, 2017 (the “Amendment”), the Company and JPF amended the Notes to eliminate the conversion feature of the Notes, such that none of the principal nor interest under the Notes may be converted into shares of the capital stock of the Company. The Amendment effectuates the elimination of JPF’s conversion rights under the Notes to acquire shares of the capital stock of the Company issuable upon conversion of the Notes
 
Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company received a $34,773 non-interest bearing advance from Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation.
 
Appointment to the Board of Directors
 
On February 23, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Antoinette Hempstead to serve as director of the Company, effective February 24, 2017. Please see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 2, 2017 for more information.
