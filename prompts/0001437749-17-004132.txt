Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 
We are the largest manufacturer of engineered steel pipe water systems in North America. With our strategically located Water Transmission manufacturing facilities, we are well-positioned to meet North America’s growing needs for water and wastewater infrastructure. We serve a wide range of markets and our solutions-based products are a good fit for applications including water transmission, plant piping, tunnels and river crossings. We have established a prominent position based on a strong and widely-recognized reputation for quality, service and an extensive range of products engineered and manufactured to meet expectations in all categories of performance including highly corrosive environments.
 
We manufacture water infrastructure steel pipe products through our Water Transmission Group, which in 2016, 2015 and 2014 generated approximately 96%, 73% and 59%, respectively, of our Net sales from continuing operations. The Water Transmission Group produces large diameter, high pressure, engineered welded steel pipe products for use in water transmission applications. Our sales have historically been driven by the need for new water infrastructure, which is based primarily on overall population growth and population movement between regions, as well as by drought conditions, which are causing a dwindling water supply from developed water sources. More recently, we have seen a trend towards spending on water infrastructure replacement, repair and upgrade.
 
In 2016, 2015 and 2014 our Tubular Products Group generated approximately 4%, 27% and 41%, respectively, of our Net sales from continuing operations. We are in the process of exploring the sale of our remaining Tubular Products business, which includes line, structural and standard pipe, and is located in Atchison, Kansas. This reflects our long-term objective to focus on our core Water Transmission business through organic growth initiatives as well as through merger and acquisition activity. The Atchison facility operated at reduced levels from April 2015 to January 2016, when we idled the facility to reduce operating expenses until market conditions improve or a sale is completed. All of the remaining previously manufactured tubular products inventory was sold by the second quarter of 2016. In recognition of this strategic decision, the discussion in this Part 1 – Item 1. “Business” is focused on the Water Transmission segment.
 
Recent Business Developments
 
On October 4, 2016, we completed the sale of our Denver, Colorado facility and recorded a gain on the sale of approximately $7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Production at the facility concluded in the fourth quarter of 2016, with final shipments and site demobilization concluding in the first quarter of 2017.
Our Industries
 
Water Transmission. Much of the United States water infrastructure is antiquated and many authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), believe the United States water infrastructure is in critical need of updates, repairs or replacements. In its 2011 Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and Assessment released in June 2013, the EPA estimated the nation will need to spend $384 billion in infrastructure investments by 2030 to continue to provide safe drinking water to the public. The American Society of Civil Engineers (the “ASCE”) has given poor ratings to many aspects of the United States water infrastructure in their 2013 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure, and in its Failure to Act: Closing the Infrastructure Investment Gap for America’s Economic Future study published in 2016, the ASCE concludes that significant portions of many municipal water systems are 40 to 50 years old and are nearing the end of their useful lives, and estimates there will be $150 billion in capital investment needs for water and wastewater infrastructure by 2025 and $204 billion in capital investment needs by 2040. The American Water Works Association concluded in their 2012 report, Buried No Longer: Confronting America’s Water Infrastructure Challenge, that from 2011 to 2035 more than $1 trillion will be needed to repair and expand drinking water infrastructure.
 
Within this market, we focus on large diameter, engineered welded steel pipeline systems utilized in water, energy, structural and plant piping applications. Our core market is the large diameter, high-pressure portion of a water transmission pipeline that is typically at the “upper end” of a pipeline system. This is the portion of the overall water pipeline that generally transports water from the source to a treatment plant or from a treatment plant into the distribution system, rather than the small lines that deliver water directly into households. We believe the addressable market for the products sold by our Water Transmission Group will be approximately $1.4 billion over the next three years.
 
A combination of population growth, movement to new population centers, dwindling supplies from developed water sources, substantial underinvestment in water infrastructure over the past several decades and an increasingly stringent regulatory environment are driving demand for water infrastructure projects in the United States. These trends are increasing the need for new water infrastructure as well as the need to upgrade, repair and replace existing water infrastructure. While we believe this offers the potential for increased demand for our water infrastructure products and other products related to water transmission, we also expect that current governmental and public water agency budgetary pressures could impact near-term demand.

The primary drivers of growth in new water infrastructure installation are population growth and movement as well as dwindling supplies from developed water sources. According to the United States Census Bureau, the population of the United States will increase by approximately 74 million people between 2016 and 2050. The resulting increase in demand will require substantial new infrastructure, as the existing United States water infrastructure is not equipped to provide water to millions of new residents. The development of new sources of water at greater distances from population centers will drive the demand for new water transmission lines.
 
In addition, many current water supply sources are in danger of being exhausted, as water systems degrade over time and cause failures to the infrastructure. Much of the drinking water infrastructure in major cities was built in the 1950s through 1970s, and the useful lives of component parts of this infrastructure ranges from 15 to 95 years. These aging water and wastewater systems will also drive demand for future investment.
 
Finally, the increased public awareness of problems with the quality of drinking water and efficient water usage has resulted in more stringent application of federal and state environmental regulations. The need to comply with these regulations in an environment of heightened public awareness towards water issues is expected to contribute to demand in the water infrastructure industry over the next several years as water systems will need to be installed, upgraded and replaced. The 2017 Dodge Construction Outlook forecasts public works construction starts will grow by 6% from 2016 levels.
 
Federal initiatives to improve the conditions of the aging water infrastructure include a new Water Finance Agency at the EPA and a Rural Opportunity Investment Initiative at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. Senate passed the latest Water Resources Development Act, which was included in the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act signed by the President in December 2016, which authorizes new infrastructure projects around the country and contains substantive provisions in regards to drinking water infrastructure. Additionally, the EPA announced the availability of approximately $1 billion in credit assistance for water infrastructure projects under the new Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (“WIFIA”) program. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy recently announced “WIFIA gives us a new opportunity to provide billions of dollars in low-interest loans to communities to build large infrastructure projects, significantly accelerating investments that benefit our nation’s public health and water security for generations to come.”
 
In addition to the Federal initiatives, individual states are also taking action. In November 2014, the State of California approved the Water Quality, Supply and Infrastructure Improvement Act (“Proposition 1”). Proposition 1 authorizes $7.5 billion in general obligation bonds to fund state water supply infrastructure projects, such as public water system improvements, surface and groundwater storage, drinking water protection, water recycling and advanced conveyance, wastewater treatment, drought relief, emergency water supplies and ecosystem and watershed protection and restoration. The State of Texas has earmarked $27 billion of future bond funding for state water projects over the next 50 years through their State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT). This program provides low-interest and deferred loans to state agencies making approved investments in water infrastructure projects. Our strategically located Water Transmission manufacturing facilities are well-positioned to take advantage of the anticipated growth in demand.
 
Tubular Products. The tubular products industry encompasses a wide variety of products serving a diverse group of end markets. We have been historically active in several of these markets, including energy, construction, agricultural, commercial and industrial systems; however, as discussed in “Overview” above, we are marketing the remaining assets in our Tubular Products business for sale.
 
Products
 
Water Transmission. Water transmission pipe is used for high-pressure applications, typically requiring pipe to withstand pressures in excess of 150 pounds per square inch. Most of our water transmission products are made to custom specifications for fully engineered, large diameter, high-pressure water infrastructure systems. Other uses include pipe for piling and hydroelectric projects, wastewater treatment plants and other applications. Our primary manufacturing process has the capability to manufacture water transmission pipe in diameters ranging from 24 inches to 156 inches with wall thickness of 0.135 inch to 1.00 inch. We also have the ability to manufacture even larger and heavier pipe with other processes. We can coat and/or line these products with cement mortar, polyethylene tape, polyurethane paints, epoxies, Pritec® and coal tar enamel according to our customers’ specifications. We maintain fabrication facilities that provide installation contractors with custom fabricated sections as well as straight pipe sections. We typically deliver a complete pipeline system to the installation contractor. We also manufacture Permalok® steel casing pipe, which is a proprietary pipe joining system that employs a press-fit interlocking connection system. The Permalok® product is generally installed in trenchless construction projects.
 
Tubular Products. The tubular products we historically produced at our Atchison, Kansas facility ranged in size from 4.500 inches to 16 inches in diameter with wall thickness from 0.134 inch to 0.375 inch. These products were typically sold to distributors or original equipment manufacturers and were used for a wide variety of applications, including energy, construction, agriculture and other commercial and industrial uses. As discussed in “Overview” above, we are marketing the remaining assets in our Tubular Products business for sale.

Marketing
 
Water Transmission. The primary customers for water transmission products are installation contractors for projects funded by public water agencies. One customer accounted for 27% of total Net sales in 2016 and 16% of total Net sales from continuing operations in 2014. No customer of our Water Transmission business accounted for 10% or more of our total Net sales in 2015. Our plant locations in Oregon, California, West Virginia, Texas, Missouri, Utah and Mexico, allow us to efficiently serve customers throughout the United States, as well as Canada and Mexico. Our Water Transmission marketing strategy emphasizes early identification of potential water projects, promotion of specifications consistent with our capabilities and close contact with the project designers and owners throughout the design phase. Our in-house sales force is comprised of sales representatives, engineers and support personnel who work closely with public water agencies, contractors and engineering firms, often years in advance of projects being bid. This allows us to identify and evaluate planned projects at early stages, participate in the engineering and design process, and ultimately promote the advantages of our systems. After an agency completes a design, they publicize the upcoming bid for a water transmission project. We then obtain detailed plans and develop our estimate for the pipe portion of the project. We typically bid to installation contractors who include our bid in their proposals to public water agencies. A public water agency generally awards the entire project to the contractor with the lowest responsive bid.
 
Tubular Products. Our tubular products were historically marketed through an in-house sales force, which has been reduced in conjunction with the idling of the Atchison, Kansas facility. Our tubular products were primarily sold to distributors. Our marketing strategy focused on quality, customer service and customer relationships. No customer of our Tubular Products business accounted for more than 10% of our total Net sales in 2016 or 2015. One customer of our Tubular Products business accounted for 10% of our total Net sales from continuing operations in 2014.
 
Manufacturing
 
Water Transmission. Water transmission manufacturing begins with the preparation of engineered drawings of each unique piece of pipe in a project. These drawings are prepared on our proprietary computer-aided design system and are used as blueprints for the manufacture of the pipe. After the drawings are completed and approved, manufacturing begins by feeding steel coil continuously at a specified angle into a spiral weld mill which cold-forms the band into a tubular configuration with a spiral seam. Automated arc welders, positioned on both the inside and the outside of the tube, are used to weld the seam. The welded pipe is then cut at the specified length. After completion of the forming and welding phases, the finished cylinder is tested and inspected in accordance with project specifications, which may include 100% radiographic analysis of the weld seam. The cylinders are then coated and lined as specified. Possible coatings include coal tar enamel, polyethylene tape, polyurethane paint, epoxies, Pritec® and cement mortar. The inside of the pipe cylinders can be lined with cement mortar, polyurethane or epoxies. Following coating and lining, certain pieces may be custom fabricated as required for the project. This process is performed in our fabrication facilities. Typically, completed pipe segments are evaluated for structural integrity with a hydrotester. Upon final inspection, the pipe is prepared for shipment. We ship our products to project sites principally by truck.
 
Tubular Products. Tubular products are manufactured by an electric resistance welded (“ERW”) process in diameters ranging from 4.500 inches to 16 inches. This process begins by unrolling and slitting steel coils into narrower bands sized to the circumference of the finished product. Each band is re-coiled and fed into the material handling equipment at the front end of the ERW mill and fed through a series of rolls that cold-form it into a tubular configuration. The resultant tube is welded by high-frequency electric resistance welders. After exiting the mill, the products are straightened, inspected, tested and end-finished. Certain products are coated.
 
Technology. Advances in technology help us produce high quality products at competitive prices. We have invested in modern welding and inspection equipment to improve both productivity and product quality. With the purchase of Permalok Corporation in December 2013, we acquired certain technologies with respect to an interlocking pipe joining system (Permalok®) that provides an alternate joint solution used for connecting steel pipes. To stay current with technological developments in the United States and abroad, we participate in trade shows, industry associations, research projects and vendor trials of new products.
 
Quality Assurance. We have quality management systems in place that assure we consistently provide products that meet or exceed customer and applicable regulatory requirements. All of our quality management systems in the United States are registered by the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”), under a multi-site registration. In addition to ISO qualification, the American Institute of Steel Construction, American Petroleum Institute, American Society for Mechanical Engineers, Factory Mutual, National Sanitation Foundation and Underwriters Laboratory have certified us for specific products or operations. The Quality Assurance department is responsible for monitoring and measuring characteristics of the product. Inspection capabilities include, but are not limited to, visual, dimensional, liquid penetrant, magnetic particle, hydrostatic, ultrasonic, real-time imaging enhancement, real-time radioscopic, base material tensile, yield and elongation, sand sieve analysis, coal-tar penetration, concrete compression, lining and coating dry film thickness, adhesion, absorption, guided bend, charpy impact, hardness, metallurgical examinations, chemical analysis, spectrographic analysis and finished product final inspection. Product is not released for shipment to our customers until there is verification that all product requirements have been met.

Product Liability. The manufacturing and use of our products involves a variety of risks. Certain losses may result, or be alleged to result, from defects in our products, thereby subjecting us to claims for damages, including consequential damages. We warrant our products to be free of certain defects for one year. We maintain insurance coverage against potential product liability claims in the amount of $51 million, which we believe to be adequate. Historically, product liability claims against us have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that product liability claims exceeding our insurance coverage will not be experienced in the future or that we will be able to maintain such insurance with adequate coverage.
 
Backlog
 
Our backlog includes confirmed orders, including the balance of projects in process, and projects for which we have been notified that we are the successful bidder even though a binding agreement has not been executed. Projects for which a binding contract has not been executed could be canceled. Binding orders received by us may be subject to cancelation or postponement; however, cancelation would generally obligate the customer to pay the costs incurred by us. As of December 31, 2016, the backlog of orders for our Water Transmission Group was approximately $66 million. Binding contracts had been executed for approximately 87% of the Water Transmission backlog as of February 10, 2017. As of December 31, 2015, the backlog of orders for our Water Transmission Group was approximately $116 million. Backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual operating results for any fiscal period. There can be no assurance that any amount of backlog ultimately will be realized.
Competition
 
Water Transmission. We have several regional competitors in the Water Transmission business. Most water transmission projects are competitively bid and price competition is vigorous. Price competition may reduce the gross margin on sales, which may adversely affect overall profitability. Other competitive factors include timely delivery, ability to meet customized specifications and high freight costs which may limit the ability of manufacturers located in other market areas to compete with us.
 
With Water Transmission manufacturing facilities in Oregon, California, West Virginia, Texas, Missouri, Utah and Mexico, we believe we can more effectively compete throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. Our primary competitor in the Water Transmission business in the western United States and southwestern Canada is NOV Ameron, a business unit of National Oilwell Varco, Inc. East of the Rocky Mountains, our primary competition includes: Forterra, Inc. (which was formerly Hanson Pipe & Precast and which acquired U.S. Pipe in 2016), which manufactures ductile iron pipe, concrete pressure pipe and spiral welded steel pipe; and AMERICAN SpiralWeld Pipe Company, LLC, Mid America Pipe Fabricating and Supply Co., Inc. and Jindal Steel and Power Limited, which manufacture spiral welded steel pipe.
 
No assurance can be given that other new or existing competitors will not establish new facilities or expand capacity within our market areas. New or expanded facilities or new competitors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to capture market share and maintain product pricing.
 
Tubular Products. The market for our tubular products historically has been highly fragmented and diversified with over 100 manufacturers in the United States alone.
 
Raw Materials and Supplies
 
We have historically purchased hot rolled and galvanized steel coil from both domestic and foreign steel mills, however in 2016 all steel purchases were from domestic steel mills. Domestic suppliers include Steel Dynamics, Inc., Nucor Corporation, ArcelorMittal USA LLC, California Steel Industries, Inc., SSAB and United States Steel Corporation. Steel for the Water Transmission business is normally purchased only after a project has been awarded to us. From time to time, we may purchase additional steel when it is available at favorable prices. Purchased steel represents a substantial portion of our cost of sales. The steel industry is highly cyclical in nature and steel prices fluctuate significantly, influenced by numerous factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, availability of raw materials, energy costs, import duties, other trade restrictions and currency exchange rates.
 
We also rely on certain suppliers of coating materials, lining materials and certain custom fabricated items. We have at least two suppliers for most of our raw materials. We believe our relationships with our suppliers are positive and have no indication that we will experience shortages of raw materials or components essential to our production processes or that we will be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. Any shortages of raw materials may result in production delays and costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulation
 
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, violation of which could lead to fines, penalties, other civil sanctions or criminal sanctions. These environmental laws and regulations govern emissions to air; discharges to water (including stormwater); and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. We operate under numerous governmental permits and licenses relating to air emissions, stormwater runoff and other environmental matters, and we are also subject to environmental laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at properties we presently own or operate and at third-party disposal or treatment facilities to which these sites send or arrange to send hazardous waste. For example, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at the Portland Harbor Site discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II — Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this 2016 Form 10-K. We believe we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and do not currently believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Based on our assessment of potential liability, we have established a reserve for an ongoing environmental assessment and potential remediation project at our former Tubular Products manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. At this time, we have no other reserves for environmental investigations and cleanup. However, estimating liabilities for environmental investigations and cleanup is complex and dependent upon a number of factors beyond our control which may change dramatically. Accordingly, although we believe our current environmental reserves are appropriate based on current information, we cannot provide assurance that our future environmental investigation and cleanup costs and liabilities will not result in a material expense.
 
Employees
 
As of January 31, 2017, we had approximately 583 full-time employees. Approximately 66% were salaried and approximately 34% were employed on an hourly basis. All of our employees are non-union, with exception of the hourly employees at our Monterrey, Mexico facility, which represent approximately 7% of our employees. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Geographic Information
 
We sold principally all of our products in the United States and Canada. As of December 31, 2016, all material long-lived assets are located in the United States. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II — Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this 2016 Form 10-K.
