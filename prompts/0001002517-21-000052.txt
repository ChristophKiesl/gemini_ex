Item 1.Business
Overview
Nuance Communications, Inc. ("We", "Nuance", or the "Company") is a technology pioneer and market leader in conversational artificial intelligence ("AI") and ambient clinical intelligence. We deliver intuitive solutions that understand, analyze, and respond to people - amplifying their ability to help others with increased productivity and security. We work with thousands of organizations globally across healthcare, financial services, telecommunications, government, and retail - to create stronger relationships and better experiences for their customers and workforce. We offer our customers a wide range of products and services, including clinical documentation, solutions for clinicians, radiologists and care teams, as well as intelligent customer engagement and security and biometric solutions for leading brands. In addition, our solutions increasingly utilize our innovations in AI, including cognitive sciences and machine learning to create smarter, more natural experiences with technology. Using advanced analytics and algorithms, our technologies create personalized experiences and transform the way people interact with information and the technology around them. We market and sell our solutions and technologies around the world directly through a dedicated sales force and a global network of resellers, including system integrators, independent software vendors, value-added resellers, distributors, hardware vendors, telecommunications carriers and e-commerce websites.
We are a global organization steeped in research and development ("R&D"). We have approximately 1,700 language scientists, developers, and engineers dedicated to continually refining our technologies and advancing our portfolio to better meet our customers’ diverse and changing needs. As of September 30, 2021, we had operations and a sales force in 27 countries. Our corporate headquarters is in Burlington, Massachusetts, and our international headquarters is in Dublin, Ireland. In fiscal year 2021, our revenue was approximately $1.4 billion.
On April 11, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft"). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Microsoft agreed to acquire Nuance for $56.00 per share in an all-cash transaction. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, following consummation of the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft with and into Nuance (the"Merger"), Nuance will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft. As a result of the Merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company. We have agreed to various customary covenants and agreements, including, among others, agreements to conduct our business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Merger. We do not believe these restrictions will prevent us from meeting our debt service obligations, ongoing costs of operations, working capital needs, or capital expenditure requirements. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, we will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $515.0 million (including in connection with our entry into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, as defined in the Merger Agreement, if certain conditions are met). The consummation of the Merger remains subject to customary closing conditions, including satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary 
closing conditions. The Merger is currently expected to close by the end of our first quarter or early in our second quarter of fiscal year 2022.
For additional information related to the Merger Agreement, please refer to the definitive proxy statement previously filed with the SEC and other relevant materials in connection with the transaction that we will file with the SEC and that will contain important information about Nuance and the Merger.
Our Strategy 
With recent sales, spin-offs and exits from various business lines, including most recently the sale of our medical transcription and EHR implementation businesses, we are positioned to be a simpler and more growth-oriented company, which enables us to prioritize and execute our conversational AI strategies within Healthcare and Enterprise. The key elements of our strategy include:
•Transitioning to and expansion of our Healthcare cloud-based offerings. We are transitioning our Healthcare solutions to the cloud, enabling us to shift our revenue mix to a more subscription-based, higher-value recurring model. We have established Nuance as a cloud platform in all our strategic solutions within Healthcare. During fiscal year 2021, we continued to make significant progress migrating our customers to the cloud with Dragon Medical One ("DMO"), PowerScribe One, and CDE One. We continued to bolster the sales of our newer cloud solutions, such as cloud-based Computer-Assisted Physician Documentation ("CAPD") solutions, and Nuance® Dragon Ambient eXperience™ (DAX™), an ambient clinical intelligence ("ACI") solution. We have created a go-to-market approach that aligns sales compensation to our cloud models, and have enabled our channel to sell Dragon Medical cloud. We also offer Dragon Medical cloud offerings in certain international markets, including UK, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, and Finland.
•Expanding our Intelligent Engagement portfolio in Enterprise, with a focus on cloud. While we maintain leadership in interactive voice response ("IVR") offerings, we have increased our focus on Intelligent Engagement growth opportunities, including digital, voice, and Security and Biometrics solutions. We expanded the cloud-native stack with the roll-out of Nuance Mix™ and Intelligent Engagement Services for Conversational AI, Messaging, and Agent AI. We continue to grow our market share of Nuance Gatekeeper, a cloud-native voice biometrics and authentication solution. These solutions offer customers more flexible integration with third-party systems and the ability to deploy across hosted, public, or private clouds. It gives large enterprises flexible deployment options while making Nuance technology available to smaller organizations via the cloud model.
•Accelerating our innovation activities. We are accelerating investment in R&D, focusing on new AI products that deliver additional value to our existing customer base. In Healthcare we continued to expand the number of specialties supported by Nuance DAX and the capabilities of Nuance DAX for telehealth. Building on our DMO platform, we offer CAPD solutions for sub-specialties, including surgical, cardiovascular, and the emergency department, as well as new capabilities for the clinical documentation specialists through CDE One. Building on our large radiology installed base, we offer a suite of additional offerings for image sharing, communication, workflow orchestration, incidental findings follow-up, and the AI marketplace for Diagnostic Imaging in Healthcare. In Enterprise, building on our strong footprint in the Fortune 100 with IVR, we increase revenue, cost savings, and customer satisfaction through the addition of digital offerings and security and biometrics solutions for a seamless omnichannel experience. Enterprises have a choice of deployment whether they leverage our world-class professional services team or leverage Nuance Mix, an open enterprise-grade, SaaS tooling suite for creating advanced conversational experiences that power virtual assistants and IVR using Nuance’s industry-leading and cloud-agnostic conversational AI.
•Expanding our go-to-market presence. We are increasing sales coverage in new markets and developing solutions to build on our platform approach to increase our customer lifetime value. In Healthcare, we are pursuing under-served markets, including community hospitals, ambulatory clinics, and surgery centers. We also launched new solutions for specialty areas such as the emergency department, cardiovascular, and surgical. In Enterprise, we are expanding our Intelligent Engagement solutions into our existing IVR customer base and delivering new rapid AI development tools that will allow us to increase our penetration into mid-market accounts.
•Expanding internationally. In Healthcare, we continue to expand our international presence in the U.K., France, DACH region, Nordics, Australia, and Canada with a growing direct sales force and new offerings. In Enterprise, we continue to expand our international presence in the U.K., France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Canada with expanded Intelligent Engagement offerings and sales focus. 
•Growing through targeted acquisitions and strategic investments. While organic growth is our priority, we also expect to selectively and opportunistically pursue acquisitions and investments in businesses and technologies that advance the strategies described above.
Segments
As of September 30, 2021, we had three reportable segments: Healthcare, Enterprise, and Other. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments. We offer our solutions and technologies to our customers in a variety of ways, including via hosted cloud-based solutions, perpetual and term software licenses, implementation and custom solution development services and maintenance and support. Our product revenues include traditional perpetual licensing, term-based licensing, royalties, and consumer sales. Our hosting, royalty, term license and maintenance and support revenues are recurring in nature as our customers use our products on an ongoing basis to handle their needs in clinical documentation, radiology diagnosis, and enterprise customer services. Our professional services offer a continuing revenue stream, whether it is provided in connection with our software solutions or on a standalone basis, as we have a backlog of engagements that take time to complete.

Our Healthcare solutions capture, improve, and communicate more than 300 million patient stories each year, helping more than 550,000 clinicians in 10,000 global healthcare organizations to drive meaningful clinical and financial outcomes. Our clinical speech recognition, medical transcription, clinical documentation improvement ("CDI"), coding, quality, and medical imaging solutions provide a more complete and accurate view of patient care. 
Our Healthcare segment revenues from continuing operations were $806.1 million, $720.2 million, and $700.6 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Healthcare segment revenues represented 59.2%, 56.1% and 55.0% of total segment revenue in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For each of fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, no customer accounted for more than 10% of Healthcare revenue.
Our principal solutions for the Healthcare segment include the following:
•Dragon Medical One: Our cloud-based speech solution provides a consistent and personalized clinical documentation experience across solutions, platforms, and devices, regardless of physical location. DMO allows clinicians to use their voice to securely capture the patient story and control applications more naturally and efficiently - anywhere, anytime. DMO is HITRUST CSF-certified and uses a secure desktop app to keep data private and protected. It helps increase productivity and offers more flexibility and personalization while establishing a firm foundation for organizations to take advantage of new and future innovations, including virtual assistants and ACI.

Exceeding the capabilities of a virtual or on-site scribe, Nuance DAX™ promotes a better patient experience by accurately capturing and appropriately contextualizing every word of the patient encounter and automatically documenting patient care without taking the physician's attention off the patient. The Nuance DAX™ solution is built on Microsoft Azure, a highly secure HITRUST CSF certified platform, compliant with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health ("HITECH") Act, and that has implemented the physical, technical, and administrative safeguards required by HIPAA.
•Clinical Documentation Improvement and Coding: Our comprehensive portfolio of cloud-based technologies is designed to help increase the productivity and effectiveness of CDI teams. Our clinically focused program and services deliver documentation guidance, AI-powered encounter prioritization, workflow management, denials support and analytics to drive better documentation across the care continuum. Designed with scale and reliability in mind, these solutions require lower installation, deployment and maintenance costs and are hosted on Microsoft Azure, a HITRUST CSF-certified infrastructure to support privacy, security and compliance. We provide real-time insights that promote a performance-driven program, allow peer comparisons and identify opportunities for improvement. Our Coding solutions offer cloud-based, enterprise-wide products and services that are designed to improve coder productivity and maintain the highest levels of accuracy and compliance. These solutions effectively manage and monitor the types of compliance coding challenges that can put a health system at risk for delayed and reduced reimbursement. We help manage the workflow by bringing together the tools needed to provide better visibility into key coding performance indicators. Coder productivity can be enhanced by enabling a more complete and accurate review of both inpatient and outpatient encounters that are associated with facility and professional service fees.
The channels for distribution in the Healthcare segment utilize our direct sales force to address the market and our professional services organization to support the implementation requirements of the healthcare industry.

We continue to invest in technologies to maintain our market-leading position and to develop new applications. We rely on a portfolio of patents, copyrights, trademarks, services marks, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. As of September 30, 2021, we held approximately 2,020 patents and 250 patent applications.
Competition
The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and are subject to rapid technology changes. There are a number of companies that develop or may develop solutions and technologies that compete in our target markets; however, currently no company directly competes with us across all of our solutions and technologies. While we expect competition to continue to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants, we believe that we will compete effectively based on many factors, including:
•Data Driven Technological Superiority. We have deep domain expertise and our conversational AI technologies, applications and solutions are often recognized as the most innovative and proficient in their respective categories. Our ASR and NLU solutions have industry-leading recognition accuracy and provide a natural, voice-enabled interaction with systems, devices and applications. This technological superiority and AI verticalization are driven by our massive data repository of over 3,000 terabytes aggregated over more than two decades. Technology publications, analyst research and independent benchmarks have consistently indicated that our solutions and technologies rank at or above performance levels of alternative solutions.
•Leverageable Base of Strategic Partnerships. We are able to leverage our strong partnerships with EHR vendors, imaging providers, and contact center infrastructure players to integrate tightly into the workflow of our clients, across clinical environments and customer service centers. Additionally, our strategic partnerships with leading technology firms allow us to accelerate the continued progress and delivery of a broad suite of offerings, through joint research, development, and selling efforts. 
•Flexible Deployment with Specialized Professional Services. By providing the optionality of supporting various hosting environments as well as offering premise-based solutions, we are flexible in how our superior technology can be deployed to the world’s largest companies. This flexibility is coupled with the high quality and domain knowledge of our professional services organization, allowing our customers and partners to place a high degree of confidence and trust in our ability to deliver results. We support our customers in designing and building powerful innovative solutions that specifically address their needs and requirements. 
•Privileged Footprint with Established, Long-Tenured Client Base. With a presence in 77% of U.S. hospitals and with 80% of radiologists, we are an established market leader within Healthcare. Our flagship product Dragon Medical has a user base of over 550,000 physicians and over 55% market share of the entire U.S. physician market, creating an exciting opportunity to deploy incremental AI solutions and added intelligence across our installed base. Within our Enterprise division, we service 85% of Fortune 100 companies, reinforcing our established position in the upper end of the market. 
•International Coverage. The international reach of our solutions and technologies is due to the broad language coverage of our offerings, including our ASR and NLU solutions, which provide recognition for over 85 languages and dialects and natural-sounding synthesized speech in over 200 voices, and support a broad range of hardware platforms and operating systems. 
•Broad Distribution Channels. Our ability to address the needs of specific markets, such as financial, law enforecement, healthcare and government, and to introduce new solutions and technologies quickly and effectively is provided by our direct sales force, our extensive global network of resellers, comprising of system integrators, independent software vendors, value-added resellers, hardware vendors, telecommunications carriers and distributors, and our e-commerce website.
Our Healthcare segment competes against Optum, Amazon, Google, 3M, Phillips, and other smaller competitors. Our Enterprise segment competes against [24]7, Amazon, Genesys, Google, LivePerson, Salesforce, and Pindrop, among other less frequent competitors. Additionally, a number of smaller companies in voice recognition, natural language understanding, and text input offer technologies or products that are competitive with our solutions. 
Current and potential competitors have established, or may establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with other parties to increase the ability of their technologies to address the needs of our prospective customers.
Some of our current or potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do.
Employees
Our success as a company is made possible by our employees. We must attract, develop, and retain exceptional talent to meet the needs of our customers and create value for our stockholders. Our human capital management strategy is therefore of critical importance to the success of our company. This strategy is built on three key pillars: (1) Inclusion and Diversity, (2) Supporting our Employees, and (3) Growing and Developing our Talent.
As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 6,900 full-time employees, including approximately 1,000 in sales and marketing, approximately 2,800 in hosting and maintenance and support services, approximately 700 in professional services, approximately 1,700 in R&D, and approximately 700 in general and administrative. Approximately 41% of our employees are based outside of the U.S. None of our employees in the U.S. are represented by a labor union. Employees of certain foreign subsidiaries are represented by labor unions or workers’ councils.
Inclusion and Diversity
Nuance’s AI solutions transform the way we connect and interact with each other, and that starts with a culture where everyone feels welcome, heard, and valued. Our team is stronger when our many diverse perspectives are celebrated – that’s how we deliver the best solutions for our company and our customers. 
We are committed to inclusion and diversity at Nuance, and our management team is focused on fulfilling this commitment. We pay close attention to our diversity metrics to ensure we are making progress toward our goals. We measure gender, ethnicity, and age diversity, and our executive team reviews and discusses these metrics regularly. Nuance is also committed to pay equity and providing equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender, race, or other personal characteristics. We conduct pay-equity reviews to ensure we remain compliant and vigilant in providing fair pay. 
At Nuance, we are focused on fostering a dynamic, diverse and inclusive workplace where each individual is celebrated for being themselves. We know that hiring people with diverse backgrounds and skillsets is a key ingredient for innovation, which is why our recruitment processes are built around improving our ability to identify the best, most diverse candidate pools. We ensure gender-neutral language in job descriptions and commit to bringing a diverse slate of candidates to a diverse interview panel at all levels of the company. We are also committed to creating an environment where our employees thrive both personally and professionally and creating opportunities for ongoing learning and dialogues that support an inclusive, diverse, and equitable culture. 
Supporting our Employees
The physical and mental well-being of our employees and their families is a key priority, and we continue to expand our global benefits offerings to support our employees at every stage of their lives. We have specifically focused on ways to support our employees and their families through our policies, benefits, resources, and programs. Some examples of this include a global parental leave of 12 weeks, a phase back to work program for new parents, enhanced medical, dental, and vision plans, and significant enhancements to our family leave and bereavement policies to ensure our employees are able to take the time they need to take care of themselves and their loved ones. We have a variety of tools and resources for our employees to provide as much support as possible while working in changed and challenging circumstances, including providing our global employees access to a free premium subscription to a meditation app, along with various mental health resources. We provide a membership to an online marketplace to help our US employees to find child and elder care along with subsidized back up child/elder days. We also provide student loan refinancing support. Nuance continues to provide access to free employee assistance plans ("EAP") globally, mental health sessions, work/life balance support sessions, virtual yoga and fitness classes, 
and we have hosted a variety of virtual sessions for the family such as cooking demos, mindfulness for kids, and financial wellness.
Growing and Developing our Talent
We believe our technology is only as brilliant as the people who create it. From interns to executives, we encourage and support our employees to be life-long learners. By equipping our employees with tools and resources, and fostering an environment focused on personal and professional growth, we empower them to evolve our solutions and to work towards their unique career goals. 
We know our best source of development and learning is each other – and we have created a variety of programs for our employees to support their development. Our global mentoring program, Mentoring Matters, allows employees to select mentors that share similar interests or have an area of expertise they wish to learn and develop in their current and future roles at Nuance. Additionally, we host monthly development workshops and product sessions with internal leaders and subject matter experts, publish monthly career development newsletters with information and resources for employees to expand their skillsets, and encourage our employees to use our multiple third-party learning platforms. 
We are also focused on ensuring our people leaders have the resources and skills they need to be effective, support their teams, and deliver on the expectations we have of our managers at Nuance. This begins with our Manager Academy program, designed for all new and existing people managers to ensure that are supported and enabled to lead their teams. Our Leadership Academy, designed for mid- to senior-level leaders, is focused on delivering curated content and workshops tailored to their individual needs. Finally, Nuance sponsors a diverse group of senior leaders across the company to participate in a Harvard-sponsored executive leadership consortium. This consortium helps organizations accelerate leadership impact and build a diverse network of executives through a bespoke curriculum of business and leadership skills that enhance self-awareness, build confidence leading teams, and broaden the command of the business.
