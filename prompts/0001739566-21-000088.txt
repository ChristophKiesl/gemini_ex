Overview
We are a leading manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of high-quality, branded snacking products in the United States. We produce a broad offering of salty snacks, including potato chips, pretzels, cheese snacks, veggie snacks, pork skins, pub/party mixes, and other snacks. Our iconic portfolio of authentic, craft, and “better for you” (“BFY”) brands, which includes Utz, Zapp’s, ON THE BORDER, Golden Flake, Good Health and Boulder Canyon, among others, enjoys strong household penetration in the United States, where our products can be found in approximately half of U.S. households. As of January 3, 2021, we operate 14 manufacturing facilities with a broad range of capabilities, and our products are distributed nationally to grocery, mass, club, convenience, drug and other retailers through direct shipments, distributors, and more than 1,600 direct store delivery (“DSD”) routes. Our company was founded in 1921 in Hanover, Pennsylvania, and benefits from nearly 100 years of brand awareness and heritage in the salty snacks industry. We are the second-largest producer of branded salty snacks in our Core Geographies, based on retail sales and we have historically expanded our geographic reach and product portfolio organically and through acquisitions. 
We believe our recent business combination with Collier Creek Holdings (“CCH”) and our enhanced access to capital as a public company best position us to realize our objective of becoming the fastest-growing pure-play branded snack platform of scale in the United States. Going forward, we plan to accelerate organic revenue growth, expand margins, and leverage our competitively advantaged route-to-market and scalable operating platform to make periodic value-enhancing strategic acquisitions.
Our business benefits from multiple opportunities to deliver attractive long-term profitable growth. Our value creation strategies are focused on driving productivity to enhance margins, reinvesting in marketing and innovation to accelerate revenue growth and continuing to make strategic acquisitions. We believe we are well-positioned for long-term growth as we (a) gained a significant amount of new buyers in the salty snack category in 2020 and repeat rates are increasing, (b) have significant opportunity in our Emerging and Growth Geographies and under-penetrated channels, (c) continue to execute productivity efforts that will help to fuel incremental marketing and innovation to accelerate growth in sales, (d) continue to make infrastructure improvements to enable us to continue to scale to greater heights, and (e) continue to make strategic acquisitions that deliver strong synergies and that enhance our competitive positioning. We believe each of these growth avenues represents a sizeable opportunity to expand our Net Sales. In addition, we further anticipate expanding our margins through supply chain productivity, revenue management, a higher-margin product mix, and higher margins on incremental sales as we leverage our scalable existing platform.
We also maintain a highly-disciplined approach to M&A and have substantial experience sourcing, executing, and integrating value-enhancing acquisitions. Since 2010, we have successfully integrated 14 acquisitions. Given our highly-scalable operating platform, we have been able to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our infrastructure and realize attractive cost savings as well as revenue and distribution increases. 
We believe these initiatives should generate attractive earnings growth as well as strong and stable free cash flow, enabling us to reinvest in our existing brands, reduce debt, and pay regular dividends to our stockholders.
Recent Developments
Effects of COVID-19. The novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, outbreak began impacting consumption, distribution and production of our products in March 2020. We are taking necessary preventive actions and implementing additional measures to protect our employees who are working on site. We continue to experience higher demand for our products versus the prior year, and we are servicing that demand by increasing production and distribution activities. Generally, producers of food products, including salty snacks, have been deemed “essential industries” by federal, state, and local governments and are exempt from certain COVID-19-related restrictions on business operations. Our strategic manufacturing capabilities and DSD distribution network have allowed us to effectively service increases in demand and be responsive to evolving market dynamics driven by changes in consumer behavior. We continue to monitor customer and consumer demands, and intend to adapt our plans as needed to continue to meet these demands. 
Recent Acquisitions
On November 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of certain assets from subsidiaries of Conagra Brands, Inc. related to the H.K. Anderson business, a leading brand of peanut butter-filled pretzels for approximately $8 million. The transaction enables us to jump-start our entry into the growing filled pretzel segment, leveraging the synergies of our salty snack platform. 
On November 11, 2020, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Truco Holdco Inc. (“Truco”), a leading seller of tortilla chips, salsa and queso sold under the ON THE BORDER® (“OTB”) brand for approximately $404.0 million. In addition on November 11, 2020, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire from OTB Acquisition, LLC certain intellectual property (“OTB IP”) for $79.0 million, including all rights to the OTB trademarks for use in the manufacture, sale and distribution of snack food products in the United States and certain other international markets. The Company closed these acquisitions of Truco on December 14, 2020.
On February 8, 2021, we completed the acquisition of certain assets from Snak-King Corp related to the Vitner's business, a leading brand of snack foods in the Chicago metropolitan area, for $25 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The Vitner's assets included intellectual property and assets associated with the distribution network, which includes approximately 55 DSD routes.
Brands
Our business is managed and reported in one operating segment. However, we actively manage our portfolio of brands by strategically segregating our sole operating segment into Power Brands and Foundation Brands. Power Brands, in aggregate, enjoy a combination of higher growth and margins, greater potential for value-added innovation, and enhanced responsiveness to consumer marketing as compared to Foundation Brands. As a result, we focus our investment spending and brand-building activities on Power Brands while managing Foundation Brands for cash flow generation to support investment in Power Brands and fund other corporate priorities.
Our Power Brands are comprised of Utz, ON THE BORDER, Good Health, Boulder Canyon, Zapp’s, Hawaiian, Golden Flake pork skins, TGIF, Herdez, and TORTIYAHS!.
Our flagship Utz brand generated retail sales in excess of $650 million in 2020, representing approximately 5.2% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) (2016-2020) and making it one of the 10 largest salty snack brands in the United States by retail sales. Recognized for its iconic logo featuring the “Little Utz Girl” since the 1920s, the Utz brand currently utilizes the slogan “Family Crafted Flavor Since 1921”. We sell a variety of salty snacks under the Utz brand, including potato chips, pretzels, cheese snacks, pub/party mixes, and others. 
Our ON THE BORDER brand, which was acquired on December 14, 2020 as part of the acquisition of Truco, is a national brand of tortilla chips, salsa and queso. OTB is the #3 tortilla chip brand in the tortilla chip sub-category. Additionally, the acquisition of OTB strengthens our national geographic footprint in our Expansion Geographies and Emerging Geographies and enhances our presence in the Mass and Club retail channels. 
Our Good Health and Boulder Canyon Power Brands anchor our position in the BFY segment of salty snacking, which has been a high-growth segment in recent years. Good Health, which we acquired in 2014, is positioned as a positive way to snack because its products have cleaner ingredients and are certified non-GMO and gluten-free. Boulder Canyon, which we acquired as part of the Inventure Foods, Inc. (“Inventure Foods”) acquisition in 2017, offers a line of premium BFY potato chips, including those made with olive or avocado oils. In the Natural channel, Boulder Canyon is the #2 potato chip brand while growing over 40% within the channel in 2020 and its “Canyon Cut” rippled avocado oil-based chip is the #1 selling potato chip item. 
Our Power Brands also include a number of our authentic craft brands including Zapp’s, Hawaiian, and Golden Flake pork skins. For example, Zapp’s, which we acquired in 2011, offers a line of premium kettle-cooked potato chips with bold, authentic flavors steeped in its New Orleans roots, including “Voodoo,” “Hotter ‘N’ Hot Jalapeño,” “Spicy Cajun Crawtators,” and “Cajun Dill Gator-tators,” among others. Hawaiian is a premium kettle chip brand that was acquired with the acquisition of Kennedy Endeavors, LLC (“Kennedy”), the DSD snacks business of Conagra Brands, Inc. (the “Kennedy Acquisition”). It evokes the feel of the Pacific islands, with exotic flavors like “Sweet Maui Onion,” “Luau BBQ,” “Mango Habanero,” and “Hulapeño.” Our Golden Flake brand, a part of Southern culture since 1923, has a full line of Southern-style pork skins with flavors like “Louisiana Hot Sauce” and “Sweet Heat Barbecue,” which offer great taste and crunch with low carbohydrates.
Our Foundation Brands include strong regional snacking brands, such as Golden Flake (excluding pork skins), Tim’s Cascade, Snyder of Berlin, “Dirty”, Kitchen Cooked, Bachman, and Jax as well as our partner and private label brands. We have historically utilized the strong regional positions and relevance of our Foundation Brands to drive increased distribution for our Power Brands. 
Products
We produce a broad range of salty snack foods, including potato chips, tortilla chips, pretzels, cheese snacks, veggie snacks, pub/party mixes, pork skins, ready-to-eat popcorn, and other snacks. Our products are packaged in a variety of different sizes and configurations, ranging from individual packages to shareable bulk containers. We also sell certain third-party branded products through our distribution network.
We believe our ability to produce a wide range of products differentiates us from some of our competitors whose businesses focus on a particular product type. We believe our broad product assortment enables us to gain greater distribution and shelf space with our customers. Our in-house production capabilities across a range of products also enable us to rapidly respond to evolving consumer needs and preferences and to better create new innovative products to delight consumers. We also believe that our diversified product portfolio results in more predictable and stable financial performance as we are not overly exposed to only one product sub-category.
Product Innovation
New product innovation is critical in the salty snacks category because consumers both enjoy long-time favorites and like to experiment with new forms, flavors, textures, and ingredients. In particular, our brands have strong competitive positions across an assortment of popular salty snacks, including potato chips, tortilla chips, pretzels, cheese snacks, pub/party mixes, veggie snacks, and pork skins. Given our long-standing customer relationships, broad production capabilities, and scalable distribution platform, we plan to strengthen our presence in certain salty snack sub-categories that we believe are highly synergistic to our existing business. We intend to expand our presence in key salty snack sub-categories through a combination of line extensions of our existing brands, new brand introductions, licensing partnerships with established brands, and/or acquisitions. We believe our expanded presence across key salty snack sub-categories would enhance our competitive position with customers and would be highly synergistic given our ability to leverage our existing manufacturing and distribution infrastructure.
As such, the level of new product innovation and the speed to market with these innovations are critical components of our business. Our innovation process begins with our marketing team, which understands our brands and consumers, and works collaboratively with our research & development and innovation leaders to identify new product opportunities that best suit our brand positions. We develop insights about unsatisfied consumer needs using our market research capabilities, and we track competitive product introductions to ensure appropriate responses. We also collaborate with third-party seasoning and flavor houses to understand the latest trends in consumer flavors and emerging consumer flavor preferences. Going forward, we intend to increase our investments in market research and other resources to generate more consumer insights and new product innovations.
We also utilize our flexible manufacturing and distribution platform to streamline the new product innovation process from idea conception through development and commercialization to market. The strategic location of our primary corporate office adjacent to our largest manufacturing plants facilitates strong coordination between our marketing, sales, research & development, and manufacturing professionals, leveraging the innovation experience of senior management and our in-house innovation leaders. Our broad in-house manufacturing capabilities across different product forms and packaging allow us to develop and commercialize new products quickly, and we have the manufacturing flexibility to handle many types of ingredients, including on-trend BFY oils such as avocado and olive. Our DSD distribution system allows us to efficiently experiment with new products at retail stores driven by the ability to quickly place new items and collect immediate feedback on sell-through trends. Finally, given the importance of in-store presence, we have a dedicated graphics team that is able to quickly develop and implement new packaging designs, impactful point-of-sale materials, and retail-ready displays.
Recent innovations include exciting new flavors such as Zapp’s “Evil Eye,” building on the success of the extreme flavor sensation in Zapp’s “Voodoo” kettle chips; Good Health “Creamy Onion & Chive Veggie Chips”; Boulder Canyon “Thin & Crisp” potato chips cooked in avocado oil; Utz Peanut Butter Filled Pretzels, flavored pretzels such as “Pumpernickel,” “Butter,” and “Everything”; and Utz “Kettle Classics” with TGI Fridays “Cheddar & Bacon” flavor. We have also introduced new product forms under the Good Health brand, including organic “Puffs” and “Fries,” as well as the TGI Friday’s brand, including “Party Sticks” shaped like French fries and “Pub Bites” shaped like chicken drumsticks. Further, we continue to introduce new packaging format innovations highlighted by the convenient POURABLES Utz cheeseballs pouches that protect your fingers while letting you enjoy your favorite snack.
Marketing, Advertising, and Consumer Engagement
Strategy. Our marketing strategy is centered around our strong brand equities, new product innovation capabilities, and the consistently high quality of our products. We conduct marketing efforts through three principal sets of activities: (i) consumer marketing and advertising, including sponsorships, print, digital, eCommerce and social media, and other product promotions; (ii) consumer sales incentives including coupons and rebates; and (iii) trade promotions to support features, displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers. We have historically relied more heavily on sponsorships, trade promotions, and in-store merchandising as our primary forms of consumer engagement. In fiscal 2020, we spent approximately $11.1 million related to consumer marketing and advertising expenses. Going forward, consistent with our value creation strategies, we intend to meaningfully increase our investments in direct consumer marketing and advertising focused on our Power Brands as well as reallocate our current mix of media spending toward activities we believe will generate the highest return on investment. We believe these strategies will have a meaningfully positive impact on our brands and help drive long-term Net Sales growth.
Digital and Social Media. In recent years we have shifted our media efforts toward digital advertising, and increased our investments in engaging with consumers directly via social media platforms. In mid-2019, we appointed a VP of Digital Marketing and eCommerce to focus on expanding and integrating our e-commerce and social media platforms. These efforts have resulted in significant increases in household reach, expanded community sizes, and increased social media engagement in 2020. We expect to continue to expand our investments in digital and social media in the future, including as part of our strategy to grow our eCommerce marketing investments.
Customers
In fiscal 2020, our top 10 customers, all of which are retailers, represented approximately 37% of our invoiced sales, and no customer accounted for more than 11% of our invoiced sales in fiscal 2020. We historically have benefited from long-term relationships with our key customers, having a sales relationship for more than 20 years on average across our top 15 retail customers.
Our strong brand equities, enhanced innovation, and increased consumer marketing spend should enable us to continue to expand distribution of our products both within existing customers and in under-penetrated retail channels. In 2020, we estimate that approximately 19% of our customers sold only one of our Power Brands and no customers sold all of our Power Brands. We believe there is an opportunity to expand our distribution in mass merchants and convenience stores, where our retail sales as a percentage of the salty snack category are lower than in other channels such as grocery or club stores.
International
More than 99% of our invoiced sales occurred in the United States in fiscal 2020, and we are focused on growing our business in the United States. Since substantially all of our business is in the United States, we believe we have more limited exposure to global economic conditions and foreign exchange fluctuations than companies with more substantial international sales and operations.
Competition
Our products primarily compete with other salty snacks but also compete more broadly for certain eating occasions with other snack foods. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the salty snacks industry include taste, convenience, product variety, product quality, price, nutrition, consumer brand awareness, media and promotional activities, in-store merchandising execution, customer service, cost-efficient distribution, and access to retailer shelf space. We believe we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors.
The salty snacking industry is competitive and includes a number of diverse participants. Our identified competitors include PepsiCo (Frito Lay), Campbell’s (Snyder’s-Lance), Kellogg’s (Pringles), General Mills, Grupo Bimbo, Hershey’s, Hain Celestial, and Arca Continental (Wise), among others. Our products also compete with private label or retailer-branded salty snacks. However, private label represented only approximately 5% of category retail sales in 2020, which was flat compared to its share of retail sales in 2013.
Historically, the salty snacks category has benefited from favorable competitive dynamics, including low private label penetration and category leaders who compete primarily via marketing and innovation.
Importantly, we are the #2 brand platform in our Core Geographies representing 9% of total salty snacks category retail sales. As of January 3, 2021 in our Core Geographies, we have the #1 position in pork skins with 27% of sub-category retail sales and the #2 positions in potato chips, pretzels and cheese snacks with 15%, 20% and 9% of sub-category retail sales, respectively. With the acquisition of OTB, as of December 14, 2020, we hold the #3 branded position with Tortillas, with a 4% share. We believe we have a strong and defensible position in our Core Geographies with a significant opportunity to enhance our national position by expanding sales in Expansion Geographies (where we represent 4.5% of category retail sales) and Emerging Geographies (where we represent 2.5% of category retail sales). 
Notably, in 2020, approximately $2.3 billion of salty snack retail sales were generated by approximately 1,300 smaller competitors, each with retail sales of less than $200 million. We believe this fragmented group of smaller brands provides an attractive opportunity for us to expand our retail sales by either acquiring or displacing smaller regional or product-specific competitors.
Supply Chain
Sourcing. The principal ingredients used to manufacture our products include potatoes, oil, flour, wheat, corn, cheese, spices, and seasonings. Our primary packaging materials include flexible films and rigid containers, such as barrels, lids, cartons, and trays. All of our core ingredients are purchased according to rigorous standards to assure food quality and safety. Our principal ingredients are generally available from multiple suppliers and we do not source any of our top 10 inputs under any single-source arrangements. As such, we believe that we can make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of an interruption of supply from our vendors. No single category of raw material purchases represented more than 13% of our Cost of Goods Sold in fiscal 2020. In addition to raw materials, we source energy and liquid fuels for our manufacturing facilities and in-house distribution assets.
We utilize various buying strategies to mitigate the impact of changes in input prices, including fixed-price forward purchases as well as commodity hedging arrangements with third parties (particularly for energy, vegetable oils, wheat, and corn). A number of external factors such as weather, commodity markets, and governmental or agricultural programs can affect the cost of raw materials used in our products. To provide greater visibility, we typically look to enter into pricing arrangements covering a meaningful portion of our forecast purchases over the next 3 to 18 months. As of March 2, 2021, we believe we have entered into pricing arrangements covering over 75% of our budgeted raw material needs in fiscal 2021.
Manufacturing. We manufacture our products primarily through 14 company-operated manufacturing facilities across the United States. These include four legacy Utz facilities and ten facilities that were added over the last ten years from acquisitions (for more details see Item 2 “Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for more details). Our facilities had capacity to produce approximately 400 million pounds of salty snacks annually in 2020 based on management’s estimate of available capacity, excluding weekly sanitation, over a seven-day work schedule, providing us with significant available capacity to accommodate increased sales. We believe this available capacity across our manufacturing footprint will enable us to leverage existing fixed costs to generate higher margins on incremental organic sales or acquired brands as well as generate potential future cost savings through consolidating our manufacturing footprint. For example, in 2018 we consolidated production from our Denver, Colorado, manufacturing facility into our Goodyear, Arizona, facility, enabling us to realize cost savings and proceeds from the sale of the Colorado facility. Our manufacturing facilities are well-maintained, and we have a program to ensure appropriate maintenance capital expenditures are undertaken. We also utilize several co-manufacturers for certain products.
Distribution. We offer national distribution of our products through our flexible, hard-to-replicate distribution system that combines direct-to-warehouse, direct-to-store, distributor, and direct-to-consumer capabilities. We believe this hybrid system, which we have built and enhanced over nearly a century, offers us flexibility to cost-effectively distribute our products to a wide range of retail locations where salty snacks are sold. Additionally, we believe our distribution system is highly scalable, resulting in the ability to drive higher margins on incremental revenues and enabling us to realize significant cost savings when integrating acquired brands into our established platform.
We benefit from strong brand awareness and heritage in our Core Geographies, where we are the second largest provider of branded salty snacks based on retail sales. We have historically expanded our geographic reach, both organically and through acquisitions, in our Expansion and Emerging Geographies. We plan to continue to expand our distribution and sales of Power Brands in these geographies, supported by our increased brand investments, expansion of our direct-to-customer and DSD distribution capabilities, and potentially through strategic acquisitions.
Direct-to-Warehouse: For a number of our customers, we either ship products directly from our facilities to their distribution centers or allow them to pick-up products directly from our facilities. These customers are then responsible for fulfilling shipments to their own retail stores. The direct-to-warehouse (“DTW”) model is often preferred by some of our national mass, club, and grocery customers that have sufficient scale and capabilities to efficiently manage distribution and replenishment for their own retail stores.
Direct-Store-Delivery: We believe we are one of only three scale U.S. salty snack providers with extensive DSD capabilities. Within our DSD system, either independent operators (“IOs”) or Utz-employed route sales professionals (“RSPs”) pick up products from our manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, storage facilities, or small bins and distribute and sell these products to retail stores within a geographic territory. Our DSD system is utilized by both large and small customers, and we believe it provides us a competitive advantage in expanding distribution, increasing shelf space, executing in-store merchandising activities, and ensuring products are fresh and available wherever consumers shop. Our DSD network included over 1,600 individual routes reaching over 75,000 retail stores in 2020. Our DSD routes are managed by a combination of approximately 1,300 IOs, covering approximately 79% of our routes, and approximately 350 RSPs, covering approximately 21% of our routes as of January 3, 2021. Over the last several years, we have converted from a predominately company-owned RSP model toward the use of third-party IOs. We believe this transition benefits us by creating motivated independent owner-operators and a more variable cost structure for our company. We expect to substantially complete our ongoing transition from RSPs toward IOs by the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 (See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Utz Brands Holdings — Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability — Independent Operator Conversions” for more details).
Third Party Distributors: We also use third-party distributors in certain regions where their capabilities enhance the cost effectiveness and reach of our overall distribution system. For third-party distributors, we either ship products directly from our facilities to their distribution centers or allow them to pick up products directly from our facilities. The distributors are then responsible for selling our products to our customers and ensuring optimal retail presence within the stores they serve, utilizing both DTW and DSD capabilities. Our third-party distributors operated an additional approximately 635 DSD-style routes, reaching over 15,000 retail stores.
Direct-to-Consumer: We also distribute our products directly to consumers. Our direct-to-consumer shipments primarily originate from orders received via our company website (www.utzsnacks.com) or select third party retailer sites, including Amazon and Sam’s Club, which extend our reach to virtually every household in America. Our direct-to-consumer shipments are delivered from our central warehouse facility to consumers using FedEx, UPS, or other third-party carriers. E-Commerce represented approximately 7% of our retail sales in fiscal 2020 and is an accelerating part of our business, with the channel having grown by more than approximately 125% as compared to 2019.
Food Safety and Quality. Food safety and quality are top priorities and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that consumers receive consistently safe and high-quality food products. Our products are manufactured in facilities that have programs and controls in place regarding consistent quality and food safety. These comprehensive programs include Safe Quality Food (SQF) certifications and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) that are designed to produce a safe, wholesome product. Our suppliers are required to have similarly robust processes in place and confirm their compliance for shipments of all ingredients to be used in our products. Finally, in addition to real-time product testing during production, we frequently monitor product attributes including taste, aroma, texture, and appearance, and random samples of finished goods are regularly sent to third-party laboratories for testing and verification.
Human Capital 
Supporting our people is a foundational value for Utz. We believe company success depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain key personnel whose skills, experience and industry knowledge benefit our operations and performance. The Company’s Board, Board committees, and management oversee various employee initiatives including compensation and benefits programs, succession planning, and leadership development and diversity and inclusion.
Utz aims to both attract and retain a qualified workforce through an inclusive and accessible recruiting process and online platform, as well as by offering competitive wages, benefits, and training opportunities. We also support and develop our employees through company-wide training and development programs intended to build and strengthen employees’ leadership and professional skills. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Utz wants to ensure that we have a workplace where every associate feels valued. It’s vital for us to ensure dignity and respect in the workplace by embracing diverse perspectives and backgrounds for all associates. Diverse teams drive better performance and greater innovation.
To further develop our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy, Utz has partnered with a nationally recognized consulting firm to aid in the development of a comprehensive strategy to ensure we are continuing to foster a work environment that values all people.
Health and Safety
The safety of our team members is a top priority. We strive to provide a safe working environment, and have policies, procedures, and training programs to ensure employees and associates understand and meet safety guidelines.  Utz and our associates are dedicated to providing a safe environment by continuously improving our Safety Culture and Performance through commitment, investment, and training. 
•Employee engagement: Leading indicators are used to both encourage and measure regular safety related activities throughout the organization
•Training: Safety training relevant to each work group’s operation is distributed throughout the organization monthly, quarterly and/or annually 
•Compliance: Regular audits in various formats are used to review and ensure compliance with applicable agency regulations
•Performance metrics: Traditional OSHA metrics are maintained on a quarterly and annual basis to measure actual performance and help identify continuous improvement opportunities
Total Rewards
We have a demonstrated history of investing in our workforce by providing competitive wages and benefits. Our benefits package includes:
•Comprehensive health insurance coverage to employees working 30 hours or more each week;
•Parental leave to all new parents for birth, adoption or foster placement;
•Short term disability to provide partial wage protection for up to 13 weeks;
•Employee stock purchase plan; 
•Wellness and disease management programs, health advocacy partner, and employee assistance programs; 
•Tuition reimbursement program; and
•401(k) plan with generous company match and profit sharing. 
Employees
As of January 3, 2021, we employed 3,083 full-time employees and 266 part-time employees.
Over the last several years, we have meaningfully reduced our number of full time employees and our selling, general & administrative expenses through our business transformation initiatives, particularly our DSD shift from RSPs to IOs and the associated restructuring of our sales management and corporate organization structure (see “— Supply Chain — Distribution” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Utz Brands Holdings — Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability —Independent Operator Conversions” for more information). We expect the ongoing shift from RSPs toward IOs to be substantially completed by the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Additionally, we historically have reduced employee count and operating expenses in relation to integration initiatives associated with our recent acquisitions.
Sustainability
We recognize the importance of Environment, Social and Governance issues for all stakeholders. As a newly public company, we are in the early stages of building our ESG framework and strategy and are using leading ESG and sustainability frameworks and guiding principles, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as stakeholder engagement to inform our ESG program. 
Cross-functional working groups and an ESG committee has been formed that has clear reporting to the executive team and the board. We recognize our responsibility to uphold the Company’s founding values which, for more than 100 years, have centered on working ethically, responsibly, and with integrity. We also look for ways to make a positive difference at work and in our communities. By collaborating with stakeholders, including team members, business partners, suppliers, and customers, we are working to become a more sustainable company.
Intellectual Property
We own numerous domestic and foreign trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. These include the U.S. trademark registrations, which protect certain rights in the following brands: Utz, ON THE BORDER, Zapp’s, Golden Flake, Good Health, Boulder Canyon, Hawaiian, TORTIYAHS!, Tim’s Cascade, Snyder of Berlin, “Dirty”, Kitchen Cooked, Bachman, Jax, and On the Border, among others. We also recently unveiled a modernization of our well known Little Utz Girl, and procured a trademark registration for her. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
We also maintain rights to the domain name www.utzsnacks.com and www.getutz.com, among others.
We believe the protection of our intellectual property, particularly our trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, copyrights and domain names, is important to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by, among other methods, relying on a combination of watch services and enforcement under intellectual property laws through the domain name dispute resolution system. For example in 2020, we were engaged in litigation against Dirty South BBQ Co., LLC in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in light of Dirty South BBQ Co., LLC’s use of certain DIRTY designations in connection with the advertising, marketing, offering for sale, and sale of pork skins and food seasonings. This matter was then transferred to the Eastern District of Tennessee in September 2020 before both parties stipulated to the dismissal of the litigation in October 2020.
In addition, from time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. We take proactive measures in attempts to avoid infringement of third party marks by conducting trademark clearance searches and taking other industry standard measures. However, this does not prevent third parties from asserting claims against us. We have received, and may in the future continue to receive, claims from third parties asserting, among other things, infringement of their intellectual property rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. See “Risk Factors — Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.” Moreover, future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves, our partners, and our customers by determining the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party proprietary rights or to establish our proprietary rights.
We also license certain third-party brand names for use on our products, including the TGI Friday’s and Herdez trademarks. We use these trademarks in connection with the manufacturing, production, and distribution of snack products to be sold under the trademarked labels. Under the agreements governing our use of such trademarks, we are required to make guaranteed annual royalty payments. Sales under the TGI Fridays and Herdez agreements represent approximately 3% of our 2020 invoice sales.
We also license certain of our owned brands, including Utz, for use by third parties in certain food categories (such as frozen foods); however, licensing revenues from these arrangements represent less than 1% of fiscal year 2020 Net Sales and are not material to our business or growth strategy. Finally, we have historically engaged in certain cross-marketing and/or promotional activities with third parties, including Major League Baseball, thereby increasing the visibility of our brands.
Seasonality
Although the demand for our products is relatively stable throughout the year as compared to other consumer goods, we have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our retail sales as a result of consumer and customer spending patterns. Historically, the months of April-September and December have resulted in higher retail sales than average due to increased consumer demand during the spring and summer months and holiday season, as well as significant retailer merchandising and promotions around those times. Additionally, we have historically generated seasonal cash flow from decreases in working capital levels in the fourth quarter and invested cash flow in working capital increases in the first quarter. We expect these historical trends to continue in the future.
Government Regulation and Compliance
We are subject to various laws and regulations in the United States by federal, state and local government authorities. In the United States, the federal agencies governing the manufacture, distribution and advertising of our products include, among others, the FTC; the FDA; the United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar state and local agencies. Under various statutes, these agencies, among other things, prescribe the requirements and establish the standards for quality and safety and regulate marketing and advertising to consumers.
We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise. Our operations, and those of our distributors and suppliers, also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters. We monitor these regulatory requirements and our compliance on a regular basis.
