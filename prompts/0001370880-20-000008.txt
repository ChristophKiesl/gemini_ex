Item 1. Business
General
We provide comprehensive intelligence-based cybersecurity solutions that allow organizations to prepare for, prevent, investigate, respond to and remediate cyber attacks, including attacks targeting on-premise, cloud, hybrid and critical infrastructure environments. Our portfolio of cybersecurity products and services helps customers minimize the risk of costly cyber security breaches by:

• | validating the effectiveness of existing cybersecurity controls before an attack occurs,


• | detecting and preventing advanced, targeted and other evasive attacks missed by other security controls,


• | enabling more efficient management of security operations, including alert management, investigation and response when a breach occurs, and


• | providing assessment, training and other strategic security consulting services that help organizations improve their resilience to attack.

We accomplish this through the integration of our core competitive advantages in solutions and services. Our core competitive advantages include:

• | Our technologies, including our machine-learning, behavioral-based, and rules-based threat detection, analysis and correlation technologies, our proprietary Multi-vector Virtual Execution ("MVX") engine, and our security validation, security orchestration, automation and response ("SOAR"), and cloud visibility technologies,


• | Our intelligence on threats and threat actors based on the continuous flow of machine-based, attacker-based and victim-based threat data from our global network of threat sensors and virtual machines, as well as threat intelligence gathered by our security analysts, consultants and incident responders, and


• | Our accumulated security expertise derived from responding to thousands of significant breaches over the past 15 years.

Our portfolio of cybersecurity solutions includes network, email, endpoint and cloud security detection and prevention solutions, threat intelligence solutions, security validation solutions, threat analysis and management solutions, and managed detection and response services. We design our cyber security solutions to rapidly incorporate new threat intelligence and adapt to changes in the threat environment in a cycle of intelligence-driven innovation. 
Our products are complemented by our strategic security consulting and incident response services. Our services leverage our products and technologies to assess customers’ security controls and processes, investigate security incidents and help customers respond to and remediate breaches. We believe that the combination of our technologies, threat intelligence and security expertise allows us to deliver more effective cyber security solutions and build long-term relationships with our customers.
We were founded in 2004 to address the inability of signature-based security solutions to detect the new generation of dynamic, stealthy and targeted cyber attacks, known as advanced persistent threats ("APTs"). To meet the challenges of detecting these previously unknown threats, for which there were no signatures, we developed our MVX engine. MVX is a virtual machine-based threat detection and analysis engine that works in conjunction with our machine-learning and behavioral analysis capabilities to detect and prevent both known and unknown threats in customers’ on-premise networks, emails, endpoints and in the cloud, while minimizing costly false positive alerts. 
Since 2013, we have evolved our business from a focus on appliance-based detection and prevention of APTs in customers’ on-premise networks by expanding our portfolio of products and services to help our customers improve their resilience to all types of cyber threats across on-premise, cloud, and critical infrastructure environments. 
In December 2013, we acquired Mandiant Corporation, a leading provider of advanced endpoint security, cloud-based threat analysis, and security incident response management solutions. As a result of the Mandiant acquisition, we expanded our threat intelligence to include contextual information on cyber attackers’ tools and techniques, augmented our threat detection technologies with endpoint detection and forensic capabilities, and added a comprehensive suite of cyber security consulting and incident response services. 
In January 2016, we acquired iSIGHT Security, Inc. and Invotas International Corporation, which increased our threat intelligence capabilities to include pre-attack adversary intelligence and added security orchestration and automation technology, respectively. 
In May 2019, we acquired Verodin, Inc., a leading provider of security validation and attack simulation software. 
In January 2020, we acquired Cloudvisory LLC, a provider of cloud visibility and control solutions.
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 8,800 end-customers, including more than 50% of the Forbes Global 2000. Our customers include leading enterprises in a diverse set of industries, including telecommunications, technology, financial services, public utilities, healthcare and oil and gas, as well as leading U.S. and international governmental agencies.
For 2019, 2018 and 2017, our revenue was $889.2 million, $831.0 million and $779.6 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 7% for 2019 and 7% for 2018, and our net losses were $257.4 million, $243.1 million and $285.2 million, respectively.
We were incorporated in Delaware in February 2004 under the name NetForts, Inc., and changed our name to FireEye, Inc. in September 2005.

Our Technologies
We have developed proprietary technologies related to machine-based threat detection, behavioral analysis, virtual machine-based threat analysis, endpoint protection and containment, security validation and security orchestration. Our technologies leverage intelligence about threat actors’ tools and techniques, gathered through analysis of our machine-based threat intelligence, our incident response engagements, and our network of security researchers, to adapt to new threats and changes in the threat environment. We believe these technologies, combined with our threat intelligence and security expertise, differentiate our products and enable the delivery of our services.
Advanced Threat Detection and Prevention Technologies. Our network, email, endpoint and cloud security solutions utilize multiple proprietary correlation and analytics engines, including our MalwareGuard machine-learning detection engine, behavior- and rules-based detection modules, signature matching engines and our proprietary, purpose-built MVX analysis engine. 
We have built our detection, correlation and analysis technologies over 15 years of research and development, and we believe they represent a significant competitive advantage for us. They first identify suspicious flows using intelligence-driven rules and analysis, including machine-learning and behavioral analysis, and then, through a separate process, use our MVX engine to determine whether such suspicious flows are malicious. This allows our network, email, endpoint and cloud security solutions to detect known and unknown threats missed by signature- and policy-based security solutions with negligible false-positive rates. 
Our advanced threat detection technologies can be deployed on a single integrated appliance, as a cloud-based service, or in a hybrid appliance/cloud architecture.
Advanced Endpoint Validation and Containment. Our endpoint security solution includes proprietary technologies that enable (i) automatic creation of indicators of compromise coupled with rapid enterprise-wide search, (ii) exploit detection and prevention, (iii) malware detection and prevention, (iv) forensic data capture and (v) rapid containment and investigation for connected and unconnected endpoints. Additionally, we have developed our endpoint technologies to correlate and consume threat intelligence from our other security solutions.
Security Validation. Our security validation software includes proprietary agents or “actors” and a central analysis and reporting engine designed to assess security effectiveness against new cyber attacks in production IT environments.
Evolved Security Architecture and Security Orchestration. Our solutions are designed to operate as part of a comprehensive security architecture to defend organizations against today's cyber threats and minimize the business impact of cyber attacks through efficient security operations and validation of security effectiveness. The ability to monitor and inspect network and email traffic, as well as stored files and forensic data, cloud activity, and equipment configurations is critical to detecting cyber threats and reducing the risk of a costly cyber breach. We combine this visibility with our dynamic, contextual and strategic threat intelligence, advanced analytics and case management tools to enable rapid, prioritized responses to critical alerts. Our SOAR tools and technologies integrate with Helix to extend security processes and response activities across the IT infrastructure. Our Helix security platform utilizes machine learning and artificial intelligence to baseline “normal” behavior and create alerts when anomalies and deviations occur. Our security validation platform complements our detection, SOAR, and other technologies by testing the effectiveness of our customers' security controls and processes. 
Customers
Our customer base has grown to approximately 8,800 end-customers as of December 31, 2019, including more than 50% of the Forbes Global 2000. We provide products, subscriptions and services to customers of varying sizes, including enterprises, governmental agencies and educational and nonprofit organizations. Our customers include leading enterprises in a diverse set of industries, including telecommunications providers, financial services entities, Internet search engines, social networking sites, stock exchanges, electrical grid operators, networking vendors, oil and gas companies, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and leading U.S. and international governmental agencies. Our business is not dependent on any particular end-customer as no end-customer represented more than 10% of our revenue for any of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, one reseller represented 14%, 15% and 13%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, one distributor represented 13%, 20% and 19%, respectively, of our total revenue. Another distributor represented 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, but did not represent 10% or greater of our total revenue for either of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
Backlog
 Orders for our appliances, software, subscriptions and services are typically shipped and billed in their entirety shortly after receipt of the order, even when the delivery term for the subscription or service extends over multiple periods. These amounts are included in deferred revenue, although the timing of revenue recognition for subscriptions and services may vary depending on the contractual service period or when services are rendered. In certain instances, a customer may request periodic billing on a multi-period subscription or service contract or we may not have a contractual right to bill at period end. In these instances, the amount billed is included in deferred revenue and the amount to be billed in the future periods is included in backlog. Subscription and services backlog has historically represented less than 2% of our annual deferred revenue and revenue. As a result, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is meaningful because it does not represent a material component of future revenue in any given period.
We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from year to year due to several factors, including the amount invoiced early in the contract term, the timing and duration of customer agreements, varying invoicing cycles of agreements and changes in customer financial circumstances. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog internally as a key management metric.
Sales and Marketing
Sales. Our sales organization consists of in-house sales teams who work in collaboration with external channel partners to identify new sales prospects, sell additional products, subscriptions and services, and provide post-sale support. Our field sales team is organized by territory and is responsible for enterprise and government accounts within their region. Our inside sales organization is responsible for sales to medium-sized and smaller organizations, and for renewal of existing subscriptions.
We also have a dedicated team focused on channel sales who manage the relationships with our value-added reseller and distributor partners and work with these channel partners to win and support customers. We believe this hybrid direct/channel sales approach allows us to leverage the benefits of broader market coverage provided by a reseller channel while maintaining a direct connection with many of our customers, including key enterprise and government accounts.
We have also cultivated alliances with non-traditional partners to generate customer referrals and extend our technologies, services and sales coverage to new market segments. These relationships include relationships with insurance providers, large systems integrators, and managed service providers, and we have engaged in joint solution development with leading providers of engineering services, payment systems, and public cloud platforms. 
As part of our sales strategy, we often provide prospective customers with our on-premise and cloud security detection and prevention solutions for a short-term evaluation period, typically ranging from one week to several months. During this period, the prospective customer conducts evaluations with the assistance of our sales engineers and members of our security research team. We believe that by providing proof of concept evaluations to potential customers, we are able to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions by identifying suspicious and potentially malicious content in their actual IT environments. For our cloud-based email security and endpoint security solutions, we allow customers to submit emails and other content previously scanned by their existing security provider for analysis by our advanced detection technologies. 
Additionally, our Mandiant consultants use our products and technologies in their incident response and strategic security consulting engagements, providing de facto proof of concept evaluations in the customer’s environment and often resulting in follow-on sales of our solutions. Our sales cycle varies by industry and can be long and unpredictable, but is typical of large, complex enterprise sales cycles that can last several months or more. However, some transactions can close in a few weeks when an active breach is discovered. 
 Our sales organization is supported by sales engineers with deep technical domain expertise who are responsible for pre-sales technical support, solutions engineering for our customers, proof of concept work and technical training for our channel partners. Our sales engineers also act as the liaison between customers and our marketing and product development organizations.
Marketing. Our marketing is focused on fostering our thought leadership in cyber security, building our brand reputation and market awareness for our solutions, driving customer demand and a strong sales pipeline, and working with our channel partners around the globe. Our marketing team consists primarily of corporate marketing, product marketing, channel marketing, account/lead development, marketing operations, and corporate communications. 
Marketing activities include demand generation, advertising, product pricing and launch activities, managing our corporate website and partner portal, trade shows and conferences, press and analyst relations, and customer awareness. We are also actively engaged in driving global thought leadership programs through blogs, media appearances, and social media and developing rich digital content such as our annual M-Trends report, our Vision digital magazine, and our webinars, podcasts and threat reports. 
Technology Alliance Partners
FireEye has built a robust ecosystem of technology alliance partners that extends the breadth and depth of our solutions. Spanning multiple technology categories, including network monitoring vendors, security information and event management vendors, network equipment vendors, forensic software vendors, web application firewall vendors, cloud platform providers, and more. These partnerships provide for threat intelligence sharing, cross-vendor technology integrations, joint go-to-market efforts and solution development collaborations. 
Our technology alliances accelerate the time to realize value from FireEye solutions and help ease the complexity organizations face implementing and managing multi-layered, multi-vendor security solutions. Technology integrations between our solutions and those of our technology alliance partners are available for free download from the FireEye Market, our website that serves as a centralized resource for tools, product extensions, applications and plug-in software developed to extend our solutions and integrate our technologies, threat intelligence and security processes into existing security workflows.
Government Affairs
We maintain relationships with several governments around the globe. Our visibility into the threat landscape, knowledge of threat actors' activities, and thought leadership in defending against cyber threats has helped to shape the legislative, regulatory and policy 
environment to enhance these governments’ individual and collective cyber posture. As part of this effort, we contribute to the evolving standard-making processes, help define best practices in various jurisdictions and help organizations of all sizes better understand the cyber threat landscape. We also help governments identify future needs and requirements. Through these and related activities, we engage on the front lines of emerging cybersecurity related public policy and use our knowledge and insight to improve the cybersecurity of our government and industry customers.
Manufacturing
The manufacturing of our security appliances is outsourced to principally one third-party contract manufacturer. This approach allows us to reduce our costs as it reduces our manufacturing overhead and inventory and also allows us to adjust quickly to changing customer demand. Our manufacturing partner assembles our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and it procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions.
Our primary contract manufacturer is Flex Ltd. ("Flex"). The manufacturing agreement we entered into with Flex does not provide for any minimum purchase commitments and had an initial term of one year, which automatically renews for one-year terms, unless either party gives written notice to the other party not less than 90 days prior to the last day of the applicable term. Additionally, this agreement may be terminated by either party (i) with advance written notice provided to the other party, subject to certain notice period limitations, or (ii) with written notice, subject to applicable cure periods, if the other party has materially breached its obligations under the agreement.
Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to develop new solutions, enhance our detection, analysis and correlation engines, expand our threat intelligence, build add-on functionality to our products, and improve our core technologies. We believe that adapting our hardware, software and cloud-based technologies to changes in the threat environment is critical to maintaining and expanding our leadership in the cyber security industry. We are also investing in security validation, security operations management, and orchestration and automation capabilities to provide security effectiveness testing, unified reporting, automated response and security orchestration features to customers in a single dashboard.
Our engineering teams have deep networking, security and data management expertise and work closely with our customers and our Mandiant consultants to identify current and future needs. Our Mandiant consultants use our products in their incident response and security assessment engagements and provide continual feedback to our engineering, product management and product marketing teams on product performance, detection efficacy, evasion techniques and attack trends. This continuous feedback mechanism allows us to adapt our solutions as the threat environment evolves.
In addition to our focus on platform expansion and enhancement, our research and development teams are focused on developing automation tools and machine learning techniques to reduce the time to discover and distribute threat intelligence, as well as generate efficiencies across our product and services offerings. 
We maintain research and development activities across the globe with teams located in India, Ireland, Singapore and the United States.
Competition
We operate in the intensely competitive IT security market which is characterized by constant change and innovation. Changes in the threat landscape and broader IT infrastructures result in evolving customer requirements for cyber security. Several vendors have either introduced new products or incorporated features into existing products that compete with our solutions. Our current and potential future competitors fall into six general categories:

• | large networking vendors such as Cisco and Juniper that may emulate or integrate security features similar to ours into their own products;


• | large companies such as IBM, Oracle and HPE that have acquired security solutions and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market;


• | independent security vendors such as Palo Alto Networks, Proofpoint and CrowdStrike that offer products or features that claim to perform similar functions to our platform;


• | small and large companies, including new market entrants, that offer niche security solutions that compete with some of the features present in our solutions;


• | providers of traditional signature-based security solutions, such as McAfee; and


• | other providers of incident response and compromise assessment services.

As our market grows and a larger share of IT budgets is allocated to cybersecurity, it will attract more highly specialized vendors as well as larger technology vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their products more effectively. The principal competitive factors in our market include:

• | ability to deliver the combination of technology, intelligence and expertise necessary to combat the current threat landscape;


• | ability to detect and prevent known and unknown threats by overcoming the limitations of signature-based approaches, while maintaining a low rate of false-positive alerts;


• | scalability, throughput and overall performance of our detection and prevention technologies;


• | solution breadth to provide visibility into all stages of an attack, especially the exploit phase;


• | ability to consolidate features onto a single platform, thereby reducing the complexity of maintaining solutions from multiple vendors;


• | the ability to integrate with third-party IT providers to enable an orchestrated solution of products and services that detect, prevent and resolve cybersecurity threats across multiple attack vectors;


• | breadth and richness of the shared threat intelligence, including dynamic and contextual threat intelligence on cyber crime, cyber espionage, hacktivism, attacks on critical infrastructure and nation-state attacks;


• | flexible deployment options, including on-premise appliances, cloud-based software or a hybrid of both, as well as "as-a-service" options;


• | ability to measure and validate the effectiveness of security controls;


• | brand awareness and reputation;


• | strength and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;


• | product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technologies in the network infrastructure;


• | ease of use and customer experience; and


• | price and total cost of ownership.

We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of the features and performance of our platform, the ease of integration of our products in diverse IT environments, the breadth of our services and solution offerings, the relatively low total cost of ownership of our products and the reputation of our Mandiant consulting organization. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, deeper customer relationships, broader distribution, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property. We rely on, among other things, patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality safeguards and procedures, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We file patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is sufficient when considering the expected lives of our products. We cannot assure you whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of valuable breadth or applicability. In addition, any patents that may be issued may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. We also license software from third parties for integration into our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.
We control access to and use of our proprietary software, technology and other proprietary information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end-customers and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright, patent and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our software, technology and other proprietary information, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology and other proprietary information. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. If we become more successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights. In particular, large and established companies in the IT security industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. From time-to-time, third parties, including certain of these large companies and non-practicing entities, may assert patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners, or our end-customers, whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party, if any, could prevent us from distributing 
certain products or performing certain services, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions, or force us to pay substantial damages (including, in the United States, treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents), royalties or other fees. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business” for additional information.
