Arconic is a global company operating in 19 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, the United States and Europe generated 63% and 26%, respectively, of Arconics sales in 2016. In addition, Arconic has operating activities in Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, and Russia, among others. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries. 
Arconics operations consist of three worldwide reportable segments: Global Rolled Products, Engineered Products and Solutions, and Transportation and Construction Solutions. 
 Alcoa Corporation Separation Transaction 
 On November 1, 2016, Alcoa Inc. completed the separation of its business into two independent, publicly traded companies (the Separation)  Alcoa Corporation and Arconic Inc. (the new name for Alcoa Inc.). Following the Separation, Alcoa Corporation holds the Alumina and Primary Metals segments, the rolling mill at the Warrick, Indiana, operations and the 25.1% stake in the Maaden Rolling Company in Saudi Arabia previously held by the Company. The Company retained the Global Rolled Products (other than the rolling mill at the Warrick, Indiana, operations and the 25.1% ownership stake in the Maaden Rolling Company), Engineered Products and Solutions and Transportation and Construction Solutions segments. 
 The Separation was effected by a pro rata distribution of 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock to the Companys shareholders (the Distribution). The Companys shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 20, 2016 (the Record Date) received one share of Alcoa Corporation common stock for every three shares of the Companys common stock held as of the Record Date. The Company did not issue fractional shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock in the Distribution. Instead, each shareholder otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share of Alcoa Corporation common stock received cash in lieu of fractional shares. 
 The Company distributed 146,159,428 shares of common stock of Alcoa Corporation in the Distribution and retained 36,311,767 shares, or approximately 19.9%, of the common stock of Alcoa Corporation immediately following the Distribution. As a result of the Distribution, Alcoa Corporation is now an independent public company trading under the symbol AA on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Company trades under the symbol ARNC on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 On October 31, 2016, in connection with the Separation and the Distribution, Arconic entered into several agreements with Alcoa Corporation or its subsidiaries that govern the relationship of the parties following the Distribution, including the following: Separation and Distribution Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, certain Patent, Know-How, Trade Secret License and Trademark License Agreements, Toll Processing and Services Agreement, Master Agreement for the Supply of Primary Aluminum, Massena Lease and Operations Agreement, Fusina Lease and Operations Agreement, and Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement.

Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks 
 The Company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage. The Companys rights under its patents, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by Arconic generally concern particular products or manufacturing equipment or techniques. Arconics business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark. As a result of product development and technological advancement, the Company continues to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world. As of the end of 2016, the Companys worldwide patent portfolio consists of approximately 1,458 granted patents and 697 pending patent applications. 
 The Company also has a significant number of trade secrets, mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets. The Company continues to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional benefits. 
 With respect to domestic and international registered trademarks, the Company has many that have significant recognition within the markets that are served. Examples include the name Arconic and the Arconic symbol for aluminum, nickel, and titanium products, Howmet® metal castings, Huck® fasteners, Kawneer® building panels and Dura-Bright® wheels with easy-clean surface treatments. A significant trademark filing campaign for the name Arconic was completed in 2016, in support of the corporate launch of Arconic Inc. As of the end of 2016, the Companys worldwide trademark portfolio consists of approximately 1,394 registered trademarks and 913 pending trademark applications.

 Competitive Conditions 
 Global Rolled Products (GRP) 
 GRP is one of the leaders in many of the aluminum flat rolled products markets in which it participates, including aerospace, automotive, brazing sheet, commercial transportation, industrial markets and regional specialties. However, much like other Arconic businesses, GRP is subject to substantial and intense competition in all of its markets. 
 While GRP participates in markets where Arconic believes the Company has a significant competitive advantage due to customer intimacy, advanced manufacturing capability and/or differentiated products, in certain cases, the Companys competitors are capable of making products similar to Arconics. The Company continuously works to maintain and enhance its competitive advantage through innovation: new alloys such as Arconics new aerospace alloys, new products such as the Companys 5 layer brazing products and break-through processes such as Arconic Micromill technology. 
 GRP comprises AAP, BCI and MPS, each serving defined segments. Some of the markets are worldwide and some are more regionally focused. Participation in these segments by GRPs competitors varies. For example, Novelis is the largest flat rolled products producer but does not participate in the aerospace market. On the other hand, Constellium participates in all major market segments including aerospace, brazing, industrial, commercial transportation and packaging. Granges participates only in the brazing sheet market. Other GRP competitors include Aleris, AMAG, Kaiser, Kobe, Nanshan, and UACJ. 
 Additionally, there are a number of new competitors emerging, particularly in China and other developing economies. For example, in the brazing business, the number of viable competitors has doubled over a five-year period. Arconic expects that this competitive pressure will continue and increase in the future as customers seek to globalize their supply bases in order to reduce costs. The Company continually monitors and plans for these new emerging players.

 Engineered Products and Solutions (EPS) 
 EPSs business unitsAPP, AFSR, AFE and ATEP are subject to substantial and intense competition in the markets they serve. Although Arconic believes its advanced technology, manufacturing processes and experience provide advantages to Arconics customers, such as high quality and superior mechanical properties that meet the Companys customers most stringent requirements, many of the products Arconic makes can be produced by competitors using similar types of manufacturing processes (e.g., closed die forgings) as well as alternative forms of manufacturing (e.g., machining out of plate). Despite intense competition, Arconic continues as a market leader in most of its principal markets. Several factors, including Arconics legacy of technical innovation, state-of-the-art capabilities, engaged employees and long-standing customer relationships, enable the Company to maintain its competitive position. 
 In the investment castings business served by APP (Nickel, Titanium and Aluminum Investment Castings), Arconics principal competitor is Precision Cast Parts Corp. (PCC). PCC produces superalloy, titanium and aluminum investment castings principally for the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets. In addition, Doncasters Group Ltd. (UK) produces superalloy investment castings for engine applications, and Pacific Cast Technologies (a subsidiary of Allegheny Technologies, Inc. (ATI)) and Selmet both manufacture titanium investment castings for jet engine and airframe applications and Consolidated Precision Products (CPP) produces superalloy and aluminum investment castings principally for the aerospace and industrial gas turbine (IGT) markets. Several of Arconics largest customers have captive superalloy furnaces for producing airfoil investment castings for their own use. Many other companies around the world also produce superalloy, titanium, and aluminum investment castings, and some of these companies currently compete with Arconic in the aerospace and other markets, while others are capable of competing with the Company should they choose to do so. 
 In the fasteners markets served by AFSR, the two principal competitors in the aerospace fastener business are PCC and Lisi Aerospace (France), with additional competition from Consolidated Aerospace Manufacturing-CAM, and TriMas. These companies together offer a comprehensive array of products in a broad range of materials (including superalloys) that directly compete in AFSRs key segments including airframe, aero-engine, aerospace, and IGT. As aerospace original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) seek to balance product supply across large and small suppliers, they view smaller and emerging competition as essential in their efforts to manage sourcing costs. 
 In the rings products market served by AFSR, Arconics principal competitor is PCC, especially through their Carlton facility. PCC produces superalloy, titanium and aluminum rings principally for the aerospace market. In addition, Forgital (France and Italy) produces rings in multiple materials, and Frisa (Mexico) manufactures rings in superalloys and titanium. Several smaller competitors around the world compete with Arconic in specific markets, depending on the equipment capability and metallurgical expertise. 
 
12 
 
In the forged products market served by AFE, Arconics largest competitors are PCC, Weber Metals (a division of Otto Fuchs KG in Germany), Aubert & Duval (a group member of Eramet in France), VSMPO-AVISMA (Russia) and Ladish Co. (a subsidiary of ATI). In the extruded products market served by AFE, the Company faces increased competition from emerging international companies, such as Nanshan (China), as customers seek lower cost sources of production. 
 International competition in the investment casting, fastener, ring and forging markets may also increase in the future as a result of strategic alliances among engine OEMs, aero-structure prime contractors, and overseas companies, especially in developing markets, particularly where offset or local content requirements create purchase obligations with respect to products manufactured in or directed to a particular country. 
 In the titanium milled and engineered products market served by ATEP, Arconics largest competitors are PCC (through its TiMet division), ATI, and VSMPO-AVISMA (Russia). ATEP also competes in the highly fragmented machining market with numerous small players throughout North America and Europe. In the highly competitive milled products space, cost and service are the differentiators, and there is continual effort to reduce prices for input raw material. For engineered products, such as the ATEP-supplied 787 seat tracks for Boeing, advanced capabilities as well as an efficient supply chain are the key differentiators.

 Transportation and Construction Solutions (TCS) 
 In the forged aluminum wheels business, AWTP competes in commercial transportation, under the product brand name Alcoa® Wheels, for the major regions that it serves (Americas, Europe, Japan, China, and Australia). AWTP competes against steel wheels, as well as aluminum. Its larger competitors are Accuride Corporation, Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation, Zhejiang Dicastal Hongxin Technology Co. Ltd, and Speedline (member of the Ronal Group). In recent years, AWTP has seen an increase in the number of aluminum wheel suppliers (both forged and cast aluminum wheels) from China, Taiwan, and South Korea attempting to penetrate the commercial transportation market. 
 BCS is a manufacturer and marketer of aluminum architectural systems and products in North America and with a growing presence in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. In North America, BCS primarily competes in the nonresidential building segment. In Europe, Asia and the Middle East, it competes in both the residential and the nonresidential building segments. BCS competes with regional and local players in the architectural systems and more global companies in the products markets. BCSs competitive advantage is the cornerstone to its strong brand, innovative products, customer intimacy and technical services. Over the past decade, the regional competitors, primarily in North America, have narrowed the product portfolio and technical services advantages. However, BCS has maintained its competitive advantage through innovative products like highly energy-efficient high-thermal products and differentiated services. BCS revenues are derived mainly from the retail, office, education and healthcare building segments. 
 BCS is organized into two business segments: architectural systems and architectural products. The primary product categories in architectural systems are storefront, framing and entrances (SEF), curtain walls, and windows. In the SEF and curtain wall businesses, BCS competes with competitors like Apogee, YKK, EFCO, Oldcastle, Schüco, Hydro/SAPA and Reynaers in their aluminum framing systems business. The architectural products business is more global and is primarily served by subsidiaries of larger companies like Alpolic (Mitsubishi Corporation), Alucobond (Schweiter Technologies) and Novelis (Aditya Birla Group). The competitive landscape in the architectural systems market has been relatively stable since the mid-2000s, with the major competitors in North America and Europe still operating in their markets, despite some industry consolidation in North America during the late 2000s. 
 LAE participates in two distinct segments: building and construction and industrial. In the building and construction market, LAE develops and markets aluminum architectural systems for both commercial and residential buildings. LAEs product portfolio provides extensive coverage of all types of buildings, from more complex projects requiring special engineering to multi-family residential buildings. In the industrial business market, LAE manufactures and sells
