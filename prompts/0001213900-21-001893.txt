ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
The discussion of the business of Genufood Energy Enzymes Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (“Genufood” or the “Company”), is as of the date of filing this report, unless otherwise indicated.
 
Original Business
 
During our historic period, we were a start-up company whose main focus was to promote, market, distribute and export a range of enzyme products manufactured in the United States for sale for human and animal consumption in certain Asian markets, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (“ASEAN”). Our objective was to commence marketing and distribution of a range of enzyme products for human and animal consumption to sole country distributors, wholesalers, dealers and retailers, as well as to the general public following a Multi-Level Marketing – Franchise Investor Dealer Related (MLM-FIDR) concept, beginning in Taiwan, and then China, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka.
 
At some point, which we believe may have occurred approximately mid- to late-2016, previous management ceased operating our original business. We have not generated any revenue from operations since that time.
 
Recent Developments
 
In 2019 and through early 2020, as previously reported, we had planned to import enzyme supplements from the United States for sale in Taiwan. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all non COVID-19 related matters, including obtaining an import license from Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), have been delayed or are taking longer than usual in Taiwan since late-January 2020. For various reasons, including the fact that without a reasonably foreseeable end of the pandemic and Taiwan government resources being shifted to dealing with the pandemic, our current management, which took office in March 2020, we decided to abandon the plan to restart our enzyme products business.
 
In May 2020, we announced that we were in the preliminary stage of developing a new business plan to sell and distribute physiological sea water and nasal spray in Taiwan and the United States. However, after exploring this possible business as a result of several factors, including but not limited to difficulties in commencing a new business during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in September 2020 we announced that we will not pursue the nasal spray business. 
 
Hukui Investment
 
While we consider our future plans for a possible business combination and/or an operating business that we would pursue on our own, in late September 2020, we announced that Hukui and we had entered into a Series C Preferred Shares Subscription Agreement dated September 23, 2020 (the “Hukui Agreement”), pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase an aggregate 200,000 shares of Hukui’s Series C Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred Shares”) at $10.00 per share, for an aggregate investment of $2,000,000. 
 
We will purchase the Series C Preferred Shares in three tranches, through a date on or before June 30, 2022, as follows:
 

● | The first tranche is 80,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of $800,000 (the “First Tranche Investment”), such shares having been purchased by us on December 15, 2020 (the “First Tranche Closing”); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The second tranche is 60,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of $600,000 (the “Second Tranche Investment”), such shares to be purchased on or before June 30, 2021 (the “Second Tranche Closing”); and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The third tranche is 60,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of $600,000 (the “Third Tranche Investment”), such shares to be purchased on or before June 30, 2022 (the “Third Tranche Closing”). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the First Tranche Closing, if Hukui does not achieve further milestones or meet further conditions, we will have the option either to (i) abandon the Second Tranche Investment and/or the Third Tranche Investment, or (ii) waive the failure of Hukui to meet such conditions and proceed with the Second Tranche Investment and/or the Third Tranche Investment.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, management and the Board of Directors may amend or abandon at any time our current intended investment in Hukui. and/or develop a business plan for a new or additional business and/or pursue a reverse merger with another company. 
 
Other Opportunities
 
Over the course of the next several months, we intend to develop a plan of operations for a business that we would operate. While we are considering a business in the healthcare or a related industry, there is no guarantee that we will develop a plan for such a business, or any business. If we are able to develop such a plan of operations, we will need to raise capital to pursue such a business. There are no commitments in place to fund any such business and no guarantee can be given that we will be able to secure such funding on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.
 
Either alone, or in combination with our current intent to develop a plan of operations for a business that we would operate, we will also consider opportunities to engage in a reverse merger with another company.
 
Certain Regulatory Matters
 
Blank Check Company 
 
Based on the current and proposed business activities described above, the Company is a “blank check” company pursuant to Rule 419(a)(2) under the Securities Act. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) defines a blank check company as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51) of the Exchange Act, and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.” 
 
 Rule 419 requires, among other things, that the proceeds of any public offering of penny stock securities by a blank check company, and all securities issued by a blank check company in such an offering, must be placed in a formal escrow or trust account until certain conditions specified in Rule 419 have been satisfied. In addition, many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions.
 
Shell Company 
 
Pursuant to Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, we are also a “shell company” because we have no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. As such, we are subject to a variety of regulations. As we have also previously disclosed, certain specific rules and regulations of the SEC apply to shell companies, including the following:

● | Shell companies may not register securities in connection with an employee benefit plan while they are a shell company and for 60 days after reporting certain current public information to the SEC regarding transactions or events resulting in the termination of shell company status. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stockholders of shell companies may not rely on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144, until the following primary requirements have been satisfied: (i) one year has elapsed since the company ceases to be a shell company and certain current information has been timely filed with the SEC regarding the cessation of the company’s status as a shell company; (ii) the company is subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act; and (iii) the company has been current in all of its periodic SEC filings for the 12 months preceding the contemplated sale of stock. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Reporting shell companies are required to disclose transactions and events that result in a shell company ceasing to be a shell company. Such disclosure is typically made on a Current Report on Form 8-K, which requires extensive information about the transactions and events in issue.

Investment Company Act 
 
By purchasing 80,000 shares of Hukui’s Series C Preferred Stock for $800,000 in the First Tranche Investment, we may be subject to registration and regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”), since we may be considered to be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities of other entities, and the investment in Hukui represents more than 40% of our consolidated assets (excluding cash and government securities) as of the date of the First Tranche Closing.
 
If we become subject to registration and regulation under the Investment Company Act, we would seek to rely on an exemption under Rule 3a-2 of the Investment Company Act, referred to as the “transient investment company” exemption, which would provide us one year to have our investment represent less than 40% of our consolidated assets (excluding cash and government securities), together with our bona fide intent to be primarily engaged in an operating business within that period of time. However, there is no guarantee that we would be able to comply with the “transient investment company” exemption or any other exemption under the Investment Company Act. That includes, but is not limited to, our ability to develop a viable plan of operations for an operating business and raise the capital necessary to pursue such a business.
 
Any requirement to register under the Investment Company and be regulated as an investment company would fundamentally change the way we do business and how we may raise capital in the future. For example, strict financial requirements are imposed on registered and regulated investment companies. Investment companies are subject to periodic audit by the SEC. Investment companies may not operate their own business and are strictly limited in raising their own equity and debt. There are strict director independence requirements imposed on investment companies. Many types of related party transactions between investment companies and their directors, officers and other corporate affiliates, such as subsidiaries, are prohibited. Investment companies may be required to maintain a diversified investment portfolio, requiring management to change its original investment strategy upon registration and regulation under the Investment Company Act.
 
Among other things, investment companies may be required to recapitalize and create a capital structure that allows investors to buy and sell interests in the investment company at will based on the concept of “net asset value” (“NAV”), that changes based on the value of the investment(s) in the company. The accounting of NAV is exceedingly complex and must be made on a daily basis. These and other strict SEC accounting requirements applicable to investment companies mean that a professionally trained administrative staff is essential to maintain the status of the investment company properly. We do not currently have personnel who would be capable of providing the required administration of an investment company, and our management also lacks this expertise.
 
Additionally, we would incur significant registration and additional compliance costs, as well as substantive regulation of our business. Any violation of the provisions of the Investment Company Act, or the rules and regulations thereunder, could subject us to material adverse consequences including but not limited to significant fines.
