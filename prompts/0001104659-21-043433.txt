ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on December 1, 2020 as a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On March 5, 2021, we filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to change our corporate name from Ark Global Acquisition Corp. to Alkuri Global Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”), effective March 8, 2021.
 
We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
On February 9, 2021, we consummated a Public Offering of 34,500,000 units, including the issuance of 4,500,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $345,000,000. In December 2020, our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 7,187,500 founder shares (“Founder Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. On February 4, 2021, we effected a 1.2-for-1 stock split of our Class B common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 8,625,000 Founder Shares outstanding. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the Sponsor, the Company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The number of Founder Shares outstanding was determined based on the Company’s expectation that the total size of the Public Offering would be a maximum of 34,500,000 units, and therefore that such Founder Shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares after the Public Offering.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 5,933,333 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to Sponsor at a purchase price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $8,900,000. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold in the Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants, so long as they are held by Sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) are not redeemable by the Company, (ii) may not (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of such Private Placement Warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by such holders until 30 days after the completion of the our initial business combination, (iii) may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) will be entitled to registration rights. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by holders other than Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company. If we do not consummate our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing the Public Offering, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
At the closing of the Public Offering and the Private Placement, $345,000,000 was placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”). Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (“Charter”) provides that the proceeds from the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (a) the completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our Charter to (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering or (ii) with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering, subject to applicable law. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.
 
After the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion of $12,075,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions payable upon consummation of our initial business combination if consummated) and approximately $1,000,000 in expenses relating to the Public Offering, approximately $1,000,000 of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and Private Placement was not deposited into the Trust Account and was initially available to us for working capital purposes. The net proceeds deposited into the Trust Account remain on deposit in the Trust Account earning interest. As of March 26, 2021, there was $345,000,000 in investments and cash held in the Trust Account and approximately $315,000 of cash held outside the Trust Account available for working capital purposes.

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
The Company is not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash held in the Trust Account, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination and the private placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the Public Offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
We believe that there are many target companies that could become attractive public companies and we will seek a target in the disruptive technology sector broadly with a spotlight on Consumer Internet and Marketplaces, Healthtech, Fintech and Mobility. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or geographic region, we are seeking to capitalize on the operational and investment experience of our management team and focus on US-based disruptive technology companies that we believe have significant growth prospects and the potential to generate attractive returns for our stockholders. We are focused on identifying potential target companies with above-industry-average growth, and a defensible market position with an enterprise value in excess of $750 million where our management team’s operational, strategic or managerial expertise can assist in maximizing value.
 
Acquisition Strategy
 
Our team has the experience, resources and track record to provide value to a potential business combination target. We are seasoned public technology company leaders with decades of experience that we will leverage to help source the prime combination candidate. We intend to use our disciplined acquisition process, based on decades of combined experience on dozens of large-scale public and private transactions, to execute a business combination that brings exceptional value to long-term stockholders.
 
In accordance with our acquisition approach, we have outlined a specific and disciplined process that we expect to help us find the most optimal target(s) with which to combine. Our intention is to follow this process to uncover a company with strong growth potential and disruptive technological capabilities. Our goal is to find a business that will generate attractive stockholder returns and create an industry leader with a strong management team and foundation to thrive in the public markets. Our intention is to adhere to the following acquisition process:
 

· | Target universe. We will focus on next generation technology platforms leveraging data and artificial intelligence in Consumer Internet and Marketplaces, Healthtech, Fintech and Mobility.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Due diligence. In our diligence process, we will look for companies with transformative business models with proven management teams, eagerness to enter into a business combination and preparedness for the public markets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Operational criteria. We intend to combine with a business that is operating in attractive markets and sectors. The company should be positioned to capture substantial market share with significant runway for growth.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Negotiations and valuation. We will develop and agree upon a valuation framework that is consistent with industry comparables. We will seek to optimize capital structure, align interests and incentives, and determine minimum acceptable deal metrics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Execution. We will partner with the management team to execute on a strategic vision that enhances profitability and creates substantial stockholder value.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Redemption Rights for Holders of Public Shares Upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Conduct of Redemptions Pursuant to Tender Offer Rules
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our Charter: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.

Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our business and acquisition strategy, and in addition to our selective diligence process, we have identified several key target attributes that we look for in our search. The purpose of outlining our target characteristics is to ensure that the business we combine with aligns with our management team’s vision and goals. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet some or all of these criteria and guidelines. We intend to identify and acquire one or more disruptive technology businesses that exhibit a number of the following criteria:

· | Visionary founders. We will look for ambitious founders with a clear vision and a deep understanding of their customer, supported by world-class management teams who are capable of scaling a global business with the support of our capital and knowledge resources.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Large market opportunity. We will prioritize our focus on investments in large and growing industries. These industries are ripe for new entrants to make significant share gains in winner-take-all or winner-take-most environments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Disruptors. We expect to focus on companies with strong brand recognition and disruptive potential in the technology universe. Ideal companies would exist within an incumbent landscape ready to be disrupted, and bring bold vision and potential for industry-wide change.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Next generation technology. We will seek to identify next generation technology platforms leveraging data and artificial intelligence.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Scalable, durable business model. We intend to seek business combination targets with recurring revenues, diversified customer bases, and operating leverage potential. Our management team has scaled many businesses and will bring our collective experience to the eventual business combination. We should favor businesses that have demonstrated an ability to accelerate adoption rates and growth during the COVID pandemic and where we believe the company can sustain or build on their growth momentum post-COVID.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Organic and inorganic growth potential. We intend to seek companies that bring robust growth yet appear to remain in early stages relative to their total addressable markets, with potential for international expansion and inorganic growth driven by market fragmentation and/or slow competitive adoption of digital practices.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Defensible market position. We intend to favor targets with demonstrated advantages when compared to their competitors and which create barriers to entry against new competitors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Exhibit unrecognized value. We seek to identify targets with under-appreciated assets, unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe have been overlooked by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we complete one or more initial business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects.

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business for the post-acquisition company to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target or assets sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target.
 
However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for the purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.
 
Resources and Competition
 
Our Charter provides that we have only 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such 24-month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 24-month time period. Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
 
Employees
 
We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in.
Facilities
 
We currently utilize office space at 4235 Hillsboro Pike, Suite 300, Nashville, Tennessee 37215 from our sponsor and the members of our management team as our executive offices. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Available Information
 
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control, acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, the Company will provide copies of these documents without charge upon request from us in writing at 4235 Hillsboro Pike, Suite 300, Nashville, Tennessee 37215 or by telephone at (615) 632-0303.

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues exceed $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
