Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a San Diego-based commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative products to address unmet needs in women’s sexual and reproductive health. 
Our first commercial product, Phexxi vaginal gel, was approved by the FDA on May 22, 2020 and commercially launched in the United States in September 2020. Phexxi is the first and only FDA-approved hormone-free, woman-controlled, on-demand prescription contraceptive gel for women. 
Our strategy is to commercialize Phexxi in the United States ourselves and in all other global markets through partnerships. 
Our lead product candidate EVO100 is being evaluated in women for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea - two of the most pervasive sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States. Currently, there are no FDA-approved prescription products to prevent infection by either of these common and dangerous pathogens. In October 2020 we initiated EVOGUARD, our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of EVO100 for these potential indications. We expect top-line results from EVOGUARD in mid-2022. 
The FDA has granted Fast Track designation to EVO100 for the prevention of chlamydia in women and has designated it a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for the prevention of gonorrhea in women. QIDP designation provides several important potential advantages to a future drug product, including possible qualification for the FDA Fast Track program, a priority review of its marketing application, and a longer period of marketing exclusivity under the FDA statutes. 
In the future, we may decide to pursue further development of EVO200 vaginal gel (EVO200), our investigational candidate for the reduction of recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV). EVO200 uses the same proprietary vaginal pH modulator platform as Phexxi and EVO100. EVO200 has been designated a QIDP by the FDA for this indication. In a Phase 1 dose-finding trial for this indication, the highest dose formulation of the study drug demonstrated reduced vaginal pH for up to seven days following a single administration.
Phexxi and our product candidates are non-hormonal, acid-buffering bioadhesive vaginal gels designed to regulate vaginal pH within the normal range of 3.5 to 4.5. This vaginal pH range is inhospitable to spermatozoa as well as certain viral and bacterial pathogens associated with certain STIs, including chlamydia and gonorrhea, but is integral to the survival of healthy bacteria in the vagina. 
Our Leadership Team
We have assembled a world-class team with industry-recognized expertise in the development and commercialization of products in women’s health. Specifically, our senior executives have a successful track record of developing and commercializing women’s health products including Mirena, Plan B One-Step, Yasmin, YAZ, NuvaRing, Paragard and Seasonique, among others.
Our Strategy 
We are committed to developing and successfully commercializing innovative products that provide women with direct control and management of their sexual and reproductive health. Key elements of our strategy include:
•Successfully commercialize Phexxi. Our primary focus is the successful commercialization of Phexxi in the United States. Outside the United States, we intend to commercialize Phexxi through strategic partnerships. We believe this approach will allow us to effectively deploy our capital to maximize the inherent value of Phexxi for the benefit of all stakeholders.
•Leverage our vaginal pH modulator platform to develop and commercialize novel, first-in-class products for women. Following the successful development and FDA approval of Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy, we are continuing the clinical development of our vaginal pH modulator platform, including our Phase 3 candidate for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea in women.

•Expand our intellectual property position by pursuing opportunities to extend the exclusivity of our highly differentiated and proprietary product candidates. We intend to aggressively pursue additional and new patent applications to broaden our intellectual property portfolio. We continue to seek domestic and international patent protection and endeavor to proactively file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
•Build our product portfolio and leverage our U.S. sales force through business development. We intend to opportunistically acquire or in-license additional products and/or product candidates to enhance our offerings and complement our core competencies in women’s health. 
Contraceptive Market Overview 
United States Contraceptive Market
The total United States contraceptive market was valued at $7.35 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach approximately $9.91 billion by 2027. 
Current contraceptive options include devices designed to prevent pregnancy through physical means, such as condoms, diaphragms and intrauterine devices (IUDs); hormone-based pharmaceutical products, including oral contraceptives (OCs), vaginal rings, intramuscular injections, subcutaneous implants and transdermal patches; and Phexxi, a prescription vaginal pH modulator that was introduced to the market in September 2020. 
In 2019, the domestic contraceptive market was dominated by four hormonal methods: OCs, hormonal IUDs, vaginal rings and subdermal implants. These methods represented four of the five top sales-generating segments in 2019. Hormonal contraceptives can be associated with undesirable side effects such as weight gain, loss of libido and mood changes, which may lead women to discontinue their use and seek alternative contraceptive methods.
Until the approval of Phexxi, there were only two non-hormonal prescription contraceptive products approved in the United States: a copper IUD and a diaphragm. A copper IUD is a device that requires an invasive, sometimes painful, medical procedure for insertion and may cause heavy menstrual bleeding. A copper IUD can remain in the user’s body for up to ten years and requires a health care provider to remove the device. A diaphragm is a device that can be difficult to insert and remove and must be used with contraceptive gel.
The only non-hormonal option within the top five sales-generating segments in 2019 was condoms, which ranked #3 in 2019 sales and is an over-the-counter (OTC) product. Besides condoms, the only currently available OTC products in the United States are nonoxynol-9 containing (N-9) spermicides. These surfactant-based products can potentially cause genital irritation and inflammation that may increase the risk of contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other STIs from an infected partner. The FDA has issued a Black Box Warning to appear on all N-9 products that states: “this product does not protect against HIV/AIDS or other STDs and may increase the risk of getting HIV from an infected partner” as well as: “Do not use if you or your sex partner has HIV/AIDS. If you do not know if you or your sex partner is infected, choose another form of birth control method.” 
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the U.S. health care sector since the first quarter of 2020. In the early stages of the pandemic, restrictions were enacted on visits to physician offices for non-emergency reasons. As a result of these restrictions and other factors, there were 920 million fewer patient diagnosis visits in 2020 compared to 2019, which resulted in almost 87 million fewer new-to-brand prescriptions last year. Furthermore, even though remote details increased greatly (approximately 290%), an approximate 56% decrease in the number of in-person details with health care providers significantly hindered their ability to learn about new-to-market brands. 
The market for prescription contraceptives is dependent on physician-prescribed and physician-administered products, and demand for contraceptive products was low during the first few months in 2020. Obstetrician/Gynecologists (OB/GYNs) prescribed fewer total prescriptions in 2020 than the year prior, including fewer new-to-brand prescriptions. However, there are early signs in 2021 that in-person details with health care providers (HCPs) are on the rise, as in-person details across all specialties exceeded that of remote details in early January 2021. 
As shown in the chart below, in the United States, 13.1 million women use no method of birth control, putting them at risk of pregnancy. An additional 10.3 million women in the United States rely on condoms or some other form of non-hormonal OTC birth control (e.g. rhythm, withdrawal). Another 18.8 million women in the United States use prescription birth control methods, which are predominantly hormone-based with the sole exception of the copper IUD.

Market Opportunity: Contraception 
Innovation and new product introduction in the women’s reproductive health care arena have been limited when compared to other therapeutic categories. We believe Phexxi is the first innovative contraceptive method introduced in the United States since NuvaRing was approved in 2001. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reducing the percentage of all unintended pregnancies has been one of the National Health Promotion Objectives since their establishment in 1980. Despite efforts to reduce their incidence, over two million unintended pregnancies occur in the United States annually. Following decades of minimal change or increase, the percentage of unintended pregnancies in the United States decreased slightly in the period from 2008 to 2011. Despite this decrease, 45% of pregnancies in the United States are still unintended. Nearly all women with sexual experience in the United States have used some form of contraception in their lives. However, many women may not use contraception consistently or correctly, which may result in an unintended pregnancy. 
In particular, there are more than 800,000 new cases of cancer reported in women in the United States every year. Many cancer treatment protocols require female patients of reproductive age to use birth control while they undergo treatment, and the vast majority of oncologists do not permit their patients to use hormonal birth control. For breast cancer patients, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine recommends that all women who are suspected or known to have breast cancer, or who have had it in the past, should avoid hormonal contraception. We have entered into strategic collaborations with the National Oncology Dispensing Association, Inc. and are seeking other strategic partnerships to potentially increase demand in these and other cancer patients of reproductive age.

Hundreds of millions of women worldwide seek contraceptive products during their, on average, 30 plus years of fertility. As such, women utilizing contraception consider the most appropriate methods for their purposes and intended use. According to the United Nations, in 2017 model-based estimates indicate approximately 75% of women of reproductive age (18 to 49) worldwide required some form of family planning. According to the National Center for Health Statistics' National Survey of Family Growth published in December 2018 there were approximately 72 million women of reproductive age in the United States. Additional attractive markets for global expansion include:

Our Commercial Product 
Phexxi as a Contraceptive
Phexxi vaginal gel is the only FDA-approved, hormone-free, on-demand, woman-controlled prescription contraceptive drug product available in the United States. We believe Phexxi’s attributes address significant gaps and unmet needs in the contraceptive market and make it an attractive contraceptive choice for women:

Key Attributes | Benefits 
Hormone-free | Phexxi is hormone-free and designed to avoid known side effects of hormone-based contraceptives, including weight gain, headaches, sore breasts, irregular periods, mood changes, decreased sexual desire, acne and nausea. These side effects have been shown to discourage women from continuing to use hormonal contraception on a long-term basis, leading them to seek alternative methods or decide to use no contraception at all. 
On-Demand/Woman-controlled | Phexxi is designed to be used as needed immediately before or up to one hour before each act of intercourse at a woman’s discretion. There is no need for consistent daily, weekly, or monthly routine. 
Bioadhesive Properties | The bioadhesive properties of Phexxi further inhibit the motility of spermatozoa while also acting as a barrier to spermatozoa penetrating the cervix for an additional level of pregnancy protection. 
Non-invasive | Other non-hormonal methods (e.g. the copper IUD) require a physician to insert or remove the device. By contrast, Phexxi does not require invasive surgical procedures, or even a visit to a health care provider's office. Where permitted by state and other applicable laws, Phexxi can be prescribed via telehealth without an in-person, face-to-face appointment with a health care provider. Phexxi is self-administered by the women and its use is private and discrete.
Ease of Use | The pre-filled Phexxi applicator is designed for convenience and to be stored at room temperature for ease of handling and use. 
No Weight Restrictions | Phexxi is designed to be used by women of any Body Mass Index with no weight restrictions, unlike many hormonal birth control options. 
Cost Effective | We anticipate mandated coverage in the United States under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA). 

Launched in September 2020, we believe Phexxi is a disruptive entry to the U.S. contraceptive landscape. Phexxi is designed to address underserved and unmet needs in the birth control market, as seen in the table below. We expect to appeal to the approximately 21 million women who are currently using no method of birth control or using some other form of non-hormonal contraception. We also believe Phexxi will appeal to women who are ready to move beyond hormones, including some of the approximately 18.8 million women using a prescription contraception, particularly pill users. Health care providers (HCPs) predict that more than 25% of these women will be switching from contraceptive methods that require a prescription or procedure, including but not limited to post-partum mothers who are spacing their pregnancies but have concerns about 
Table of Contents

hormones in their breast milk and women diagnosed with cancer for whom hormone use is contraindicated. According to our post-commercial launch market research, approximately 60% of HCPs indicated they would recommend Phexxi to patients using natural contraceptives, approximately 58% indicated that they would recommend Phexxi to patients using over-the-counter contraceptive products and approximately 26% indicated they would recommend Phexxi to patients using prescription contraception or methods requiring an HCP to perform a procedure.

Vaginal pH Modulator Mechanism of Action
A normal vaginal pH of 3.5 to 4.5 is important for maintaining good vaginal health. At this optimal pH level, the vagina contains a balance of necessary healthy bacteria. Additionally, a vaginal pH in this range is inhospitable to sperm as well as certain viral and bacterial pathogens. 
Phexxi was developed to have acid-buffering (pH 3.5), bioadhesive and viscosity-retaining properties to provide effective acidification of the male ejaculate in the vagina and to form a long-lasting layer of gel over the vaginal and cervical surfaces. Typically, the introduction of semen (pH = 7.2-8.0) into the vagina causes a rise in pH above 6.0 due to the alkalinity of the ejaculate, which neutralizes the normally acidic vaginal environment, and allows for the survival of sperm. Phexxi prevents pregnancy by maintaining a normal vaginal pH (pH = 3.5-4.5) even in the presence of semen, inhibiting sperm from reaching the ovum to form a zygote. This buffering capacity is due to Phexxi’s active pharmaceutical ingredients. Other properties contributing to Phexxi's mechanism of action are its capacity to immobilize sperm, maintain sufficient viscosity even upon dilution with the introduction of semen into the vagina, impede cervical mucus penetration, and its bioadhesive properties that form a protective layer over the vaginal and cervical epithelium.
The diagram below shows the respective pH levels of the vagina and semen.
Commercialization Strategy
Our strategy is to commercialize Phexxi vaginal gel and subsequent products in the United States ourselves. We are leveraging our leadership team’s extensive commercial experience and have deployed a dedicated sales team focused on maximizing the commercial return from Phexxi. Our approach allows for strategic deployment in key markets of full-time employees whose sole focus and commitment is the success of Phexxi, as well as other products we may develop, in-license or acquire. We will continue to invest in our sales team training and development to ensure high levels of retention, productivity, and ultimately, profitability.
For markets outside of the United States, we intend to establish regional and/or global partnerships by either sublicensing the commercialization rights or entering into distribution agreements with one or more third parties for the commercialization of Phexxi and/or the applicable product candidate in that market. We would expect these third parties to be involved in the regulatory process in their respective markets as well as any clinical trials to support regulatory submissions, if required.

Commercialization of Phexxi in the United States
We believe the United States market is the largest commercial opportunity for Phexxi and our investigational product candidates. 
Our comprehensive commercial strategy for Phexxi vaginal gel includes marketing and public relations awareness campaigns targeting the approximately 21 million females in the United States of reproductive potential who are not using hormonal contraception, as well as certain identified target health care provider segments; payer outreach; and execution of our consumer digital and media strategy. With the Phexxi Concierge ExperienceTM, our comprehensive telehealth support system (the Phexxi Concierge Experience), women can, through our independent third-party telehealth service providers, secure a prescription, determine their insurance coverage and/or out-of-pocket costs, receive counseling support and refill reminders, and fill their prescription through their local neighborhood pharmacy or an online pharmacy. 
We commercially launched Phexxi in September 2020 with a hybrid sales force promoting Phexxi directly to obstetricians, OB/GYNs and allied HCPs, who collectively write the majority of prescriptions for contraceptive products. Our sales force comprises 59 regional business representatives, 11 regional business managers, a strategically focused tele-sales team through our partnership with Archer Health care, a tele-sales communication platform, and a self-guided, virtual health care provider learning platform. 
The top 10% of prescribers account for 70% of the annual branded contraception prescriptions in the United States. We are currently targeting the top 20,000 contraceptive prescribers. We have focused our targeting effort on approximately 10,000 high-volume HCPs and 3,500 accounts identified through our segmentation project as likely early adopters of Phexxi based on their beliefs that the best form of birth control for women is one they will use. 
The efforts of Evofem's sales team are complemented by multi-channel marketing campaigns to raise brand awareness, including direct-to-consumer and health care professional campaigns. These key initiatives are supported by advertising campaigns encompassing social media, print and digital media, paid search initiatives, and public relations efforts. 
In February 2021, we launched a major direct-to-consumer advertising campaign, known as “Get Phexxi,” designed to drive awareness and educate women on the benefits of Phexxi. The “Get Phexxi” campaign introduced Phexxi as a revolution in birth control that puts women in charge of their bodies, their sex lives, and their pregnancy prevention. The campaign highlights some of the struggles women face when choosing among the many available methods of contraception, including the lack of control with condoms, constant daily use of the pill, or abstinence required for cycle tracking. We believe the women featured in this campaign represent the real-life drawbacks that Phexxi may help eliminate as a hormone-free, on-demand birth control method. “Get Phexxi” launched nationally, airing the brand’s first-ever commercial across broadcast, connected, and streaming television networks. The campaign extends broadly to reach women across numerous other touch points through a highly targeted and multi-pronged digital and social media plan, designed to reach consumers at the point of care. During the two week period immediately following our February 2021 “Get Phexxi” launch, our ads generated approximately 115 million views. For the weeks ended February 19, 2021 and February 26, 2021, we estimate that approximately 300 telehealth appointments were booked through the Phexxi Concierge Experience, all of which were completed and resulted in Phexxi prescriptions. Two weeks after the "Get Phexxi" campaign launch, Phexxi brand awareness, as measured by monthly surveys conducted by an independent third-party research group among women at risk for pregnancy, doubled since January 2021. In addition, organic internet search statistics have increased approximately 362% since our commercial launch and direct web traffic, and users typing “phexxi.com” into their internet browsers has increased approximately 200% since our commercial launch.
Our experienced team of key account managers and medical science liaisons focus on educating key payer accounts, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), key opinion leaders and medical associations about the importance of offering a wider set of options to women seeking non-hormonal, woman-controlled contraceptive methods. These educational activities have been and will continue to be supported by presentation of clinical data at key national congresses (such as the annual meetings of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Family Planning, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, and Nurse Practitioners in Women’s Health), clinical publications, and additional market development activities. 
Payer and Reimbursement Strategy: United States 
Pricing Strategy
Our pricing strategy for Phexxi was informed by extensive payer research including discussions with decision makers at major health plans and PBMs across the United States who control nearly 83 million commercial lives. Based on this 
Table of Contents

gathered intelligence, we priced Phexxi at $267.50 per box of 12 applicators, which on an annualized basis is comparable to the average annual cost of other branded contraception products.
In June 2020, two major drug information databases that payers consult for pricing and product information, Medi-Span and First Databank, granted Phexxi a new classification in their databases and pricing compendia as the first and only “Vaginal pH Modulator.”
Third-party Payers
Market acceptance and sales of Phexxi and our other product candidates, assuming approval, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products will be available from third-party payers, which include government health administration authorities, managed care organizations, private health insurers and PBMs. Third-party payers decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product are made on a payer-by-payer basis. One payer’s determination to provide coverage for a drug does not assure other payers will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for that drug.
Managed care organizations and other private insurers frequently adopt their own payment or reimbursement reductions. The continued integration between commercial health plans and PBMs has increased the negotiating power of these entities. Third-party payers increasingly employ formularies, which may not include all the products approved for a particular indication, to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. We continue to work with both health plans and PBMs to secure additional formulary positioning for Phexxi. 
As of February 2021, we have coverage for approximately 55.1% of U.S. commercial lives (99.9 million of 181.5 million total covered lives in channel), including approximately 8 million lives covered at no out-of-pocket cost. Approximately 13.7 million lives are covered under our December 2020 contract award from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. 
We are also participating in all government programs which include 340B and the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which took effect January 1, 2021, and affords access to Phexxi for the U.S. Medicaid population, comprising approximately 68 million members. We are also advocating for the Office of Women’s Health to update and expand its list of contraceptive categories to include a new category “vaginal pH modulator” to reflect Phexxi’s unique mechanism of action which we believe would increase coverage for women of reproductive age.
Contraceptive Market Landscape
The contraception market was established in 1960 with the introduction of “the pill,” the first oral contraceptive widely available to women in the United States. This high-dose hormonal option remained the primary form of available contraception on the market until 1988 when the copper IUD was introduced, offering the first hormone-free option for birth control. As shown in the timeline below, there was no notable innovation providing additional options in women’s reproductive health until almost 30 years after the introduction of “the pill,” when pharmaceutical companies introduced synthetic hormonal products with different hormonal delivery systems, including the hormonal IUD, implants, the patch, and vaginal ring.
We expect that Phexxi vaginal gel will grow the prescription birth control user market when considering the 28.3 million women who are currently at risk for pregnancy and do not use hormone-based contraceptives as their primary form of contraception. Additionally, as women’s expectations change throughout their contraceptive journey, we expect Phexxi to compete for market share in at least four categories: 1) oral contraception, 2) Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC), comprising implants and IUDs, 3) non-oral hormonal contraceptives, comprising weekly or monthly options including the patch, vaginal ring and injectables, and 4) OTC methods, dominated primarily by the condom.
Prescription Contraception
In the United States an estimated 18.8 million women use prescription contraception. 
Table of Contents

OCs
Oral contraceptives, also known as the pill, are the most commonly used form of birth control in the United States today. Birth control pills are marketed under a variety of brand names, and currently, there are only two promoted branded pills: Lo Loestrin® Fe (Allergan) and Natazia® (Bayer). There are two main kinds of OCs: combination birth control pills, which contain estrogen and progestin, and the “mini pill,” which contains only progestin. OCs typically must be taken on a regular or daily basis to be effective.
LARC
LARC is not dependent on user adherence, which appeals to those who benefit from a passive form of birth control with no daily requirement to take a pill. However, many women have decided to remove their LARC due to the hormonal side effects they experience. Others have been deterred by the risks of the copper IUD brought to light by ongoing lawsuits.
Implants
The contraception implant must be implanted under the skin and removed by a qualified health care provider, requiring a medical procedure. It provides contraception by releasing hormones over a three-year period. The implant (principally marketed in the United States as Nexplanon® by a subsidiary of Merck & Co.) has realized an increase in market share over the past five years, outpacing the overall contraceptive category year-over-year.
IUDs
The copper IUD was introduced to the market in 1988 and provides protection by disrupting sperm motility and damaging sperm so that they are prevented from joining with an ovum. Today, the copper IUD is principally marketed by Cooper Surgical, Inc. as Paragard.
 The hormonal IUD is principally offered under the brand names, Kyleena®, Skyla® and Mirena, a family of products from Bayer Pharmaceuticals. All IUDs must be inserted and removed by a physician.
Non-oral, Hormonal Contraceptives
Contraceptive Patch
The weekly contraceptive patch was introduced in 2000 by Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen division; however, deaths resulting from venous thromboembolism due to hormonal exposure had a significant negative impact on the patch and led to label changes restricting utilization. Following the loss of exclusivity, Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen division exited women’s health care and contraception as a promotional category. A new branded patch was launched in late 2020 under the brand name Twirla® (Agile Therapeutics). 
Vaginal Ring
The hormonal vaginal ring by Merck & Co. was introduced to the market in 2001. The ring is used for three weeks and then removed for a week during menses and a new hormonal vaginal ring is inserted. The efficacy for the vaginal ring is similar to hormonal oral contraception. Users of the vaginal ring report the same incidence of hormonal related side effects as those using oral hormonal contraception. 
An annual hormonal vaginal ring was launched in the United States in 2020 under the brand name Annovera® (TherapeuticsMD). 
Injectables
The primary injectable hormonal contraceptive on the market is Depo-Provera® offered by Pfizer Inc. Each injection provides protection for up to 12 to 14 weeks, but patients must receive injections once every 12 weeks to get full contraceptive protection. Depo-Provera was introduced to the market in 1992.
Non-prescription OTC
In the United States an estimated 10.3 million women rely on OTC products for their contraceptive needs.
Table of Contents

Condoms are the dominant product offering in OTC sales. Approximately six million women depend on condom use as their only method of birth control. The predominant brands are Trojan (Church & Dwight) and Durex (Reckitt Benckiser). 
Additional OTC products include spermicides, which are available in sponges, jelly/creams, and foams. Spermicides carry a black box warning label and have very limited utilization.
Vaginal pH Modulator
The adoption of Phexxi is expected to come equally from each category discussed, as interest in Phexxi falls into three distinct segments: (1) those women who are not currently using hormone-based contraceptives; (2) those women awaiting an alternative to hormonal contraception; and (3) those women who are expected to utilize Phexxi as added protection to their current form of birth control. Our market research has indicated that the hormone-free, on-demand, woman-controlled aspect of Phexxi makes it an attractive option across the entire competitive set.
Ex-United States Markets
In markets outside of the United States, we intend to establish regional and/or global partnerships by either sublicensing the commercialization rights or entering into distribution agreements with one or more third parties for the commercialization of Phexxi and/or the applicable product candidate in that market.
Manufacturing
We outsource the manufacturing of Phexxi (and our investigational product candidates) to a third party. We are currently contracted with a gel manufacturer to manufacture Phexxi in accordance with all applicable current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) regulations, as well as in compliance with all applicable laws and other relevant regulatory agency requirements for manufacture of pharmaceutical drug products and combination drug-device products. As of December 31, 2020, we estimated that we had manufactured inventory on hand to support approximately six months of anticipated demand for Phexxi.
We are currently installing a second filling and packaging line at our manufacturer. We expect this line will be installed and qualified for manufacturing in the second half of 2021, thereby increasing our production capabilities to meet anticipated market demand for Phexxi.
Our Pipeline 
EVO100 for STI Prevention
Evofem's lead product candidate, EVO100, is an antimicrobial vaginal gel for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea in women. EVO100 is currently being evaluated in the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial EVOGUARD for these potential indications.
The CDC announced in 2021 that it estimates that one in five people in the United States have an STI, which translates to an estimated 68 million infections at any moment in the United States alone. Furthermore, CDC states that any sexually active person can be infected with chlamydia or gonorrhea; which suggests that approximately 78 million sexually active women (18-65 years old) in the United States are potentially at risk for STIs. 
Despite the CDC recommendation for condom use to prevent STIs, rates of infection with chlamydia and gonorrhea in the United States climbed in 2018 for the fifth consecutive year. The CDC reported 1.8 million new cases of chlamydia, the most ever reported, and approximately 600,000 new cases of gonorrhea, also the highest reported. Many cases are not reported because most people with chlamydia and many women with gonorrhea are asymptomatic and do not seek testing. We believe this represents a significant commercial opportunity. 
Additionally, in December 2020 CDC updated its “Treatment Guidelines for Gonococcal Infection” due to the increasing resistance of gonorrhea and other organisms to treatment with the antibiotic azithromycin, which was the prior standard of care. 
Phase 2b/3 Trial for STI Prevention
In 2019 we completed AMPREVENCE, a double-blinded, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 2b/3 trial (AMPREVENCE) to evaluate the efficacy of EVO100 for the prevention of sexual transmission of chlamydia (primary 
Table of Contents

endpoint) and gonorrhea (secondary endpoint). This trial enrolled 860 women 18 to 45 years of age at approximately 50 sites in the United States. 
AMPREVENCE met both its primary and secondary endpoints of reducing the risk of chlamydia and gonorrhea infection, respectively, and demonstrated that EVO100 was generally safe and well tolerated. The infection rate of chlamydia among women who used EVO100 for the four-month study period was 4.9% (n=14/288) compared to 9.8% among those who used placebo for four months (n=28/287) (p=.024), a relative risk reduction of 50% in the primary endpoint. Among the reported cases of gonorrhea infection, the infection rate was 0.7% in the EVO100 arm (n=2/280), compared to 3.2% in the placebo arm (n=9/277) (p=.03), a relative risk reduction of 78% in the secondary endpoint. EVO100 was generally safe and well tolerated in this study population with the number of adverse events similar across both arms (7.2% for EVO100 and 7.5% for placebo) and no serious treatment-related adverse events reported.
FDA had previously indicated that if AMPREVENCE met its primary endpoint, it could be considered as one of two pivotal trials required for approval of EVO100 for the prevention of chlamydia in women, for which it has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. As discussed below, the FDA’s Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process of reviewing new drugs and provides eligibility for priority review, if relevant criteria are met. 
EVOGUARD
Following our end of phase 2 meeting with the FDA in May 2020, in October 2020 we initiated EVOGUARD. As of February 28, 2021, 59 sites have been activated. We expect to complete enrollment in this clinical trial in 2021 and to report top-line results in mid-2022. Assuming positive results, we expect to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA by year-end 2022. 
As previously noted, EVO100 has also been granted QIDP designation by the FDA for the prevention of urogenital gonorrhea infection in women. A summary of the EVOGUARD study and design is provided below.
EVOGUARD Study Design
EVOGUARD is a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled clinical trial with a 16-week active treatment phase to evaluate EVO100 for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea. The study is designed to enroll 1,730 women aged 18 years and older who are at risk of urogenital chlamydia or gonorrhea infection at 90 sites across the United States. The design of the study is illustrated in Figure 1. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of EVO100 in the prevention of urogenital chlamydia and gonorrhea infections.

Rush License Agreement
In 2014, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Rush University (the Rush License Agreement) pursuant to which Rush University granted us an exclusive, worldwide license of certain patents and know-how related to our multipurpose vaginal pH modulator technology (the Rush License IP) authorizing us to make, distribute and commercialize products and processes for any and all therapeutic, prophylactic and/or diagnostic uses, including, without limitation, use for female vaginal health and/or birth control. Pursuant to the Rush License Agreement, we are obligated to pay to Rush University an earned royalty based upon a percentage of net sales in the range of mid-single digits. In September 2020, we entered the first amendment to the Rush License Agreement, pursuant to which we are also obligated to pay a minimum annual royalty amount of $100,000 to the extent the earned royalties in any given year do not equal or exceed $100,000 commencing January 1, 2021.
We also have the right to sub-license our rights to affiliates (without the prior approval of Rush University) and to third parties (with the prior written approval of Rush University). To the extent Rush University approves of a third-party sub-license, in lieu of any royalty payment obligation under the Rush License Agreement, we would then be under an obligation to pay Rush University a sub-license fee equal to a percentage of any sublicensing revenue received from any third-party sub-licensee. Rush University retained a royalty free, non-exclusive license from us for the Rush License IP for non-commercial research purposes.

The Rush License Agreement contains additional customary representations and warranties, covenants, indemnification and insurance and confidentiality provisions for agreements of its type. The Rush License Agreement may be terminated upon mutual written consent of both parties or by a non-breaching party if the other party commits a breach or default of any covenant in the agreement and fails to cure this breach within 30 days after receiving written notice of the breach or default.
Unless terminated in accordance with its terms, the Rush License Agreement continues until the expiration, revocation or invalidation of the last of the patents or the abandonment of the last patent application included within the licensed patents and technology, including any patent claiming an improvement made during the term of the Rush License Agreement in the course of research supported or developed by Rush University utilizing the technology.
Intellectual Property 
We strive to protect the proprietary vaginal pH modulator gel technology both internationally and domestically. We seek and maintain patents intended to cover our product candidates, and their methods of use, as well as any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We endeavor to properly file patent applications for new inventions we deem may have commercial value. We also may rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will depend on our ability, in part: to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business defend and enforce our patents, and other intellectual property rights, and preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We will also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
As of February 28, 2021, we owned or had exclusive license to 55 issued patents and allowed applications in the United States and other countries and jurisdictions, and had 27 patent applications pending in the United States and other countries and jurisdictions. This includes two U.S. patents which cover Phexxi and its labeled indication that were listed in the U.S. FDA publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book), in December 2020.
We have the Rush License IP, which provide general protection for our vaginal pH modulator platform. Our vaginal pH modulator platform could be eligible for regulatory extensions to at least 2024 in the United States and to 2026 in certain European jurisdictions, if granted by those regulatory bodies. Rush University has submitted a patent term extension (PTE) application requesting a five-year PTE for the U.S. patent and has received an Order Granting Interim Extension (OGIE), which extends the expiration of the U.S. patent by one year to 2022. Further, we solely own several patent application families relating to the composition and therapeutic use of our vaginal pH modulator gel, which, upon issue, would expire at the earliest in 2033. We believe that our licensed and solely owned non-hormonal birth control gel patents and pending patent applications, combined with our substantial know-how in this field, will continue to provide opportunities for us to establish a significant barrier to competitor entry into the market.
In addition to patents, we rely, and expect to rely, on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive positions. For example, certain aspects of the composition, manufacturing, and use of Phexxi are protected by unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Although trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect, we seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, collaborators, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for these incidents. In addition, our trade secrets and know-how may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting intellectual property, including trade secret, know-how and inventions.

Government Regulation and Product Approval 
The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory requirements, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
Post-Approval Requirements in the United States
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting approved drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”). Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. Prescription drug promotional materials also must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the approved drug or combination product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials.    
Any limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our product and product candidates must meet cGMP requirements and satisfy the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities’ satisfaction before any product candidate is approved and our commercial products can be manufactured. Evofem relies, and expects to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of its products and product candidates in accordance with cGMPs. These manufacturers must also comply with cGMPs that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or combination products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including recall.
Once an approval or clearance of a drug or combination product is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, or imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
Table of Contents

•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Most recently, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, including most biological products. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Hatch-Waxman Act and Marketing Exclusivity
Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Amendments) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute and also enacted Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug (RLD). Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. In contrast, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. A Section 505(b)(2) applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies, if it can establish that reliance on studies conducted for a previously-approved product is scientifically appropriate. Unlike the ANDA pathway used by developers of bioequivalent versions of innovator drugs, which does not allow applicants to submit new clinical data other than bioavailability or bioequivalence data, the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway does not preclude the possibility that a follow-on applicant would need to conduct additional clinical trials or nonclinical studies; for example, they may be seeking approval to market a previously approved drug for new indications or for a new patient population that would require new clinical data to demonstrate safety or effectiveness. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the label indications for which the RLD has been approved, or for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant, as applicable.
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. The Orange Book listing for the Phexxi vaginal gel NDA includes two patents covering the product’s composition of matter and its method of use in prevention of pregnancy. Except for patents covering methods of use for which the follow-on applicant is not seeking approval, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed in the Orange Book for the RLD, when an ANDA applicant submits its application to the FDA. To the extent the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, such an applicant is also required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. 
Specifically, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for a follow-on drug product with respect to each patent must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed by the original applicant; (ii) the listed patent already has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a specified date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the new product. 
If a Paragraph I or II certification is filed, the FDA may make approval of the application effective immediately upon completion of its review. If a Paragraph III certification is filed, the approval may be made effective on the patent expiration date specified in the application, although a tentative approval may be issued before that time. If an application contains a Paragraph IV certification, a series of events will be triggered, the outcome of which will determine the effective date of approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. 
Table of Contents

A certification that the new product will not infringe the RLD’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the follow-on applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders for the RLD once the applicant’s NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a legal challenge to the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of their receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant. Alternatively, if the listed patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the follow-on applicant’s ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay.
In addition, under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the referenced RLD has expired. These market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a drug containing a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. 
The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving follow-on applications for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity also will not delay the submission or approval of a traditional NDA filed under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. However, an applicant submitting a traditional NDA would be required to either conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The Phexxi NDA is subject to this form of three-year new product exclusivity, which expires on May 22, 2023.
Designation of and Exclusivity for Qualified Infectious Disease Products
In 2012 as part of the Food Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, Congress passed legislation known as the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act (GAIN Act), which amended the FDCA to encourage the development of antibacterial and antifungal drug products that treat pathogens that cause serious and life-threatening infections. The law grants an additional five years of marketing exclusivity upon the approval of an NDA for a drug product previously designated by FDA as a QIDP. As a result, if applicable to a designated QIDP, upon approval the periods of five-year new chemical entity exclusivity and three-year new clinical investigation exclusivity would become 10 years and eight years, respectively.
A QIDP is defined in the GAIN Act to mean “an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by: (1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens;” or (2) certain “qualifying pathogens.” A “qualifying pathogen” is a pathogen that has the potential to pose a serious threat to public health (e.g., resistant gram positive pathogens, multi-drug resistant gram negative bacteria, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and Clostridium difficile) and that is included in a list established and maintained by FDA. A drug sponsor may request FDA to designate its product as a QIDP any time before the submission of an NDA. FDA must make a QIDP determination within 60 days of the designation request. A product designated as a QIDP may be granted priority review by FDA upon submission and can also qualify for “fast track” status, described further below. We have received QIDP designation from the FDA for EVO100 for the prevention of urogenital gonorrhea infection in women. 
Fast Track and Priority Review Designations
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast track designation and priority review designation.
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the NDA for a fast track 
Table of Contents

product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. Fast track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. A product candidate designated as a QIDP is eligible for fast track designation under the provisions of the GAIN Act, but the NDA sponsor must specifically request fast track designation from the agency as with non-infectious disease product candidates. Fast track designation may be requested concurrent with or at any time after the QIDP designation. In addition, although QIDP designation may be requested prior to submission of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), a request for fast track designation may only be made concurrently with, or any time after, submission of an IND.
The FDA also may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug or biologic that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines at the time that the marketing application is submitted, on a case- by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months for an original new molecular entity NDA from the date of filing. Although the FDA automatically gives priority review designation to the first application submitted for a specific drug product and indication for which a QIDP designation was granted, a subsequent application from the same sponsor for the same product and indication will receive priority review designation only if it otherwise meets the criteria for priority review.
Finally, even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
Patent Term Restoration in the United States
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited PTE under other provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. These PTEs permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for any patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any PTE or restoration.
Other U.S. Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters
If we establish international operations, we will be subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the FCPA), which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA for activities by our partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents.
Importantly, United States authorities that enforce the FCPA, including the Department of Justice, deem most health care professionals and other employees of foreign hospitals, clinics, research facilities and medical schools in countries with public health care or public education systems to be “foreign officials” under the FCPA. If and when we interact with foreign health care professionals and researchers in testing and marketing our products abroad, we must have policies and procedures in place sufficient to prevent us and agents acting on our behalf from providing any bribe, gift or gratuity, including excessive or lavish meals, travel or entertainment in connection with marketing our products and services or securing required permits and approvals such as those needed to initiate clinical trials in foreign jurisdictions. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the maintenance of books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and the development and maintenance of an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Table of Contents

Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements involving exclusive license rights, if any, or acquisitions, if any, may be subject to national or supranational antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.
Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and future commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved in those markets.
We must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of a product in those countries. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. As of January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) is no longer a member state of the European Union (EU), and therefore a separate marketing authorization application (MAA) and approval will be required to market a medicinal product in the UK. 
We are currently assessing the optimal regulatory legal basis for the Phexxi MAA in the EU and the UK. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed in the EU only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial applications must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted and it is anticipated to come into application in late 2021. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU member states, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the EU will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.
The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU member states in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted. Part II is assessed separately by each EU member state concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU member state. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
To obtain marketing approval of a drug in the EU, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU member states, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the 
Table of Contents

evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks.
The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in specific EU member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any EU member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for an applicant to apply to one-member state to assess the application (the reference member state) and specifically list other member states in which it wishes to obtain approval (concerned member states). Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labelling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and each concerned member state. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application which is then reviewed and approved commented on by the concerned member states. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
In the EU, only products for which marketing authorizations have been granted may be promoted. A marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). Even if authorized to be marketed in the EU, prescription-only medicines may only be promoted to health care professionals, not the general public. All promotion should be in accordance with the particulars listed in the summary of product characteristics. Promotional materials must also comply with various laws, and codes of conduct developed by pharmaceutical industry bodies in the EU which govern (among other things) the training of sales staff, promotional claims and their justification, comparative advertising, misleading advertising, endorsements, and (where permitted) advertising to the general public. Failure to comply with these requirements could lead to the imposition of penalties by the competent authorities of the EU member states. The penalties could include warnings, orders to discontinue the promotion of the drug product, seizure of promotional materials, fines and possible imprisonment.
EU Regulatory Exclusivity
In the EU, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the EU and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, or Africa, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Other U.S. Health Care Laws and Regulations
We must comply with various U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral (Stark Law) laws, rules and regulations. HCPs and third-party payers play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products and medical devices. Our current and future arrangements with health care professionals, principal investigators, consultants, third-party payers and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other health care laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include but are not limited to the following:
Anti-Kickback Statute - the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, among other things, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federally funded health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
California Consumer Privacy Act - the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA).
Civil and Criminal False Claims Laws - the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 - the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making any false statements relating to health care matters; as in the case of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation. Additionally, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and its implementing regulations impose certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization, on entities subject to the law, such as certain HCPs, health plans, and health care clearinghouses and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the creation, use, maintenance or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information.
False Statements Statute - the federal False Statements Statutes prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement to the federal government, including executive or administrative agencies.
Stark Law - the federal ban on physician self-referrals prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationships, including compensation arrangements or ownership interests, with that entity.
Sunshine Act - the federal transparency or “sunshine” requirements of the ACA requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS) information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians, teaching hospitals and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
State Transparency Laws - some United States state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to HCPs and other HCPs or marketing expenditures; some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other HCPs or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.

State and Foreign Regulatory Concerns - there are analogous State and foreign laws and regulations, such as State Anti-Kickback and False Claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving health care items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payers, including private insurers. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health and personal information. These laws differ from each other in significant ways and may conflict, while applying simultaneously with HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
The scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change. Notably, in November 2020, DHHS finalized significant changes to the regulations implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute, as well as the Stark Law and the civil monetary penalty rules regarding beneficiary inducements, with the goal of offering the health care industry more flexibility and reducing the regulatory burden associated with those fraud and abuse laws, particularly with respect to value-based arrangements among industry participants (although these final regulations may be vulnerable to being overturned by Congress under the procedures set forth in the Congressional Review Act, which could be applied to regulatory actions taken by the Trump administration on or after August 21, 2020). Regulatory authorities might challenge our current or future activities under these laws, regulations, and safe harbors. Any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with these laws will involve substantial costs. Any investigation of us or the third parties with whom we contract, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time consuming. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, monetary fines, imprisonment, disgorgement of profits, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, debarment under the FDCA, additional reporting or oversight obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with the law, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Health Care Reform and Potential Changes to Laws and Regulations
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, legislative and regulatory changes both enacted and proposed related to the health care system, which could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In particular, the FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), was passed by Congress and signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and devices and to spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is uncertain. In addition, in August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act was signed into law, which reauthorized the FDA’s user fee programs and included additional drug and device provisions that build on the Cures Act. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in health care systems with the stated goals of containing health care costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. As another example, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020 incorporated extensive health care provisions and amendments to existing laws, including a requirement that all manufacturers of drug products covered under Medicare Part B report the product’s average sales price (ASP) to DHHS beginning on January 1, 2022, subject to enforcement via civil money penalties.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or effectively repealed. In particular, in December of 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), effective January 1, 2019. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court’s ruling that the individual mandate in the ACA was unconstitutional but remanded the case to the district court to determine whether other reforms enacted as part of the ACA but not specifically

related to the individual mandate or health insurance could be severed from the rest of the ACA so as not to have the law declared invalid in its entirety. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case and allocated one hour for oral arguments, which occurred on November 10, 2020. A decision from the Supreme Court is expected to be issued in spring 2021. It is unclear how this litigation and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will affect the implementation of that law, the pharmaceutical industry more generally, and our business. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the ACA and its possible repeal or replacement on our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), which was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and was designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030, in order to offset the added expense of the 2020 cancellation. The 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act was subsequently signed into law on December 27, 2020 and extends the CARES Act suspension period to March 31, 2021.
As another example, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2020 into law (P.L. 116-94) that includes a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019 (the CREATES Act). The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their products to deny generic product developers access to samples of brand products. Because generic product developers need samples to conduct certain comparative testing required by the FDA, some have attributed the inability to timely obtain samples as a cause of delay in the entry of generic products. To remedy this concern, the CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on “commercially reasonable, market-based terms.” Whether and how generic product developers will use this new pathway, as well as the likely outcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain highly uncertain and its potential effects on our future commercial products are unknown. Other new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have an adverse effect on customers for our approved product and, accordingly, our financial operations.
Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of manufacturers’ pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. DHHS has solicited feedback on various measures intended to lower drug prices and reduce the out of pocket costs of drugs and has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2020, the FDA finalized a rulemaking to establish a system whereby state governmental entities could lawfully import and distribute prescription drugs sourced from Canada. Those new regulations became effective on November 30, 2020, although the impact of such future programs is uncertain, in part because lawsuits have been filed challenging the government’s authority to promulgate them. The final regulations may also be vulnerable to being overturned by a joint resolution of disapproval from Congress under the procedures set forth in the Congressional Review Act, which could be applied to regulatory actions taken by the Trump administration on or after August 21, 2020 (i.e., in the last 60 days of legislative session of the 116th Congress. Congress and the executive branch have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, in July 2020, President Trump announced four executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempted to implement several of his Administration’s proposals, including a policy that would tie Medicare Part B drug prices to international drug prices; one that directed DHHS to finalize the Canadian drug importation proposed rule previously issued by DHHS (which has since been finalized, as noted above) and made other changes allowing for personal importation of drugs from Canada; one that directed DHHS to finalize the rulemaking process on modifying the anti-kickback law safe harbors for plans, pharmacies, and pharmaceutical benefit managers after DHHS confirms that the action is not projected to increase federal spending, Medicare beneficiary premiums, or patients’ total out-of-pocket costs (which DHHS finalized in November 2020, also making those rules subject to potentially being overturned under the Congressional Review Act); and one that reduces costs of insulin and epinephrine auto-injectors to patients of federally qualified health centers. President Trump also issued another executive order on September 13, 2020 that directed DHHS to undertake rulemaking in order to test an international reference pricing model for prescription drug products, which was also implemented by DHHS and then challenged in federal court by industry groups in December 2020. The probability of success of these newly announced policies and their impact on the U.S. prescription drug marketplace is unknown. There are likely to be continued political and legal challenges associated with implementing these reforms as they are currently envisioned, and the January 20, 2021 transition to a new Democrat-led presidential administration created further uncertainty. Following his inauguration, President Biden took immediate steps to order a regulatory freeze on all pending substantive executive actions in order to permit incoming department and agency heads to review whether questions of fact,

policy, and law may be implicated and to determine how to proceed. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states’ ability to regulate PBMs and other members of the health care and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area.
Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
Sales of Evofem’s products approved for marketing by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed care organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of Evofem’s FDA-approved products will be made on a payer-by-payer basis. Prescriptions generated through the Phexxi Concierge Experience may be subject to additional payer requirements. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our approved products to each payer separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the DHHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Congress has expressed its intention to repeal or repeal and replace the ACA. If that is done, many if not all of the provisions of the ACA may no longer apply to prescription drugs.
The marketability of any products for which Evofem has or will receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased, and Evofem expects will continue to increase, the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessment) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of Evofem’s approved drug products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.

Summary Risk Factors
The risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us. These are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. of this Report and the other reports and documents filed by us with the SEC.
•We have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows since our inception and anticipate we will continue to incur significant losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future.
•We have generated nominal revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.
•We must raise significant additional funds to finance our operations and to remain a going concern. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce and/or eliminate one or more of our business initiatives.
•Our business has been adversely affected and could be materially and adversely affected in the future by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
•Our success will depend heavily on whether we can successfully commercialize our only commercially available product, Phexxi, for prevention of pregnancy. Failure to successfully commercialize Phexxi for prevention of pregnancy would likely cause our business to fail.
•Our commercialization strategy in light of the COVID-19 pandemic is unproven and if it is not successful, will harm our business and limit our ability to sell our product.
•If we are unable to establish effective internal sales and marketing capabilities, or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell any of our approved products, our ability to generate revenue would be adversely affected.
•Medical product manufacturers’ use of social media platforms to market and promote prescription products, such as Phexxi, presents new risks and operational challenges.
•We face competition from other medical device, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.
•Phexxi and any other approved products may not gain sufficient market acceptance among physicians, patients or the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenue, which will undermine our future growth prospects.
•The telehealth market is immature and unpredictable, and if it does not develop, if it develops more slowly than we expect, if it encounters negative publicity over privacy issues, if it is difficult to engage sufficient numbers of providers, or if limitations on reimbursement or new state law regulatory requirements impede our ability to implement our telehealth solution, the growth of our business will be harmed.
•The success of Phexxi will depend on the availability of contraceptive alternatives and women’s preferences, in addition to the market’s acceptance of our new form of prevention of pregnancy.
•The commercial success of Phexxi or any future approved products will depend in significant measure on the label claims that the FDA or other regulatory authorities approve for those products.
Table of Contents

•The proportion of the contraceptive market that is made up of generic products continues to increase, making introduction of a branded contraceptive difficult and expensive.
•Our inability to develop our vaginal pH modulator for additional indications could have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to successfully market Phexxi for prevention of pregnancy.
•The success of our business is also expected to depend in part upon our ability to identify, license, discover, develop or commercialize additional product candidates. Failure to identify additional product candidates would have a negative impact on our business and operations.
•Clinical trials are costly, time consuming and inherently risky, and we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.
•Due in part to our limited financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates and we may be unable to pursue and complete the clinical trials we would like to pursue and complete.
•If our clinical trials fail to satisfactorily demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the FDA and other comparable foreign regulators, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
•Even though we have received approval from the FDA in the United States to market Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy, we may fail to receive similar approval outside the United States.
•If we are unable to take full advantage of regulatory programs designed to expedite drug development or provide other incentives, our development programs may be adversely impacted.
•Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of Phexxi or development of EVO100. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance or are required to pay for liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage, a material liability claim could adversely affect our financial condition.
•Our rights to develop and commercialize Phexxi and EVO100 are subject, in part, to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by third parties. The patent protection and patent prosecution of Phexxi and EVO100 is dependent on third parties.
•If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy, for EVO100 or other proprietary technologies we may develop, or if the scope of the patent protection we have or will obtain is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to our products and technology, and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, and other proprietary technologies we may develop may be adversely affected.
•If we do not obtain PTE for our products or product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.
•Our success relies on third-party suppliers and one contract manufacturer. Any failure by these third parties, including their inability to successfully perform and comply with regulatory requirements, could negatively impact our business and our ability to develop and market our products or product candidates, and our business could be substantially harmed.
•We rely and intend to rely on third parties for the execution of our development programs for our product candidates and for the delivery of telehealth services through the Phexxi Concierge Experience. Failure of these third parties to provide services of a suitable quality, in accordance with applicable regulations and within acceptable time frames may cause the delay or failure of our development programs.
•Phexxi and any other approved product may face follow-on competition sooner than anticipated.
•Despite FDA-approval for Phexxi and even if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval to market other product candidates in the United States, revenues may be adversely affected if Phexxi or any other the product does not obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers in the United States.
•As we mature and expand our sales and marketing infrastructure, we will need to expand the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth or be unable to successfully commercialize our products, develop any product candidates or otherwise implement our business plan.
