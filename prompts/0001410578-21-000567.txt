ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Introduction
We are a blank check company incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 18, 2019 for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination.
On November 24, 2020, we consummated the IPO of 8,009,041 shares of our common stock (“Public Shares”), which includes the partial exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 509,041 Public Shares, at a price of $10.00 per Public Share, generating gross proceeds of $80,090,412. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the sale of 3,146,454 private warrants (“Private Warrants”) to the Sponsor at a price of $0.90 per Private Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $2,831,809. The Private Warrants were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transaction did not involve a public offering.
The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of the IPO to purchase up to 1,125,000 additional Public Shares to cover over-allotments, if any, at the IPO price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. As a result of the underwriter’s election to partially exercise the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 509,041 Public Shares, a total of 615,959 Public Shares remained available for purchase at a price of $10.00 per Public Share. On January 8, 2021, the underwriters’ election to exercise their remaining over-allotment option expired unexercised.
Following the closing of the IPO on November 24, 2020, an amount of $80,090,412 ($10.00 per Public Share) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Public Shares in the IPO and the sale of the Private Warrants was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 183 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account as described below. The proceeds in the trust account will not be released until the earlier of: (1) the completion of an initial business combination by November 24, 2022 and (2) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period.
On January 1, 2020, we issued an aggregate of 2,156,250 shares of common stock (the “founder shares”) to the Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. On September 30, 2020, LifeSci Holdings LLC transferred 215,625 founder shares to Chardan Healthcare Investments LLC, an investor in the Sponsor. The founder shares included an aggregate of up to 153,990 shares of common stock that remained subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor, following the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their over-allotment option so that the number of founder shares would collectively represent 20% of our issued and outstanding shares upon the completion of the IPO. On January 8, 2021, the underwriters’ election to exercise their remaining over-allotment option expired unexercised, resulting in 615,959 shares no longer subject to forfeiture and the forfeiture of 153,990 shares. Accordingly, as of January 8, 2021 and June 30, 2021, there were 2,002,260 Founder Shares issued and outstanding.

Merger Agreement
On May 6, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with LifeSci Acquisition II Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), and Science 37, Inc. (“Science 37”), pursuant to which the Merger Sub will merge with and into Science 37, with Science 37 surviving the merger as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). Our board of directors has unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) resolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement and related matters by our stockholders.
Treatment of Science 37 Securities:
Preferred Stock. Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) and subject to the consent of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Science 37’s Series A, Series, B, Series C, Series D and Series D-1 preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (collectively, the “Science 37 Preferred Stock”), voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis, each issued and outstanding share of Science 37 Preferred Stock will be converted into shares of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Science 37 (the “Science 37 Common Stock”) at the then-applicable conversion rates (the “Science 37 Preferred Stock Conversion”).
Warrants. At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Science 37 capital stock (“Science 37 Warrant”) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into a warrant exercisable to receive our common stock, in accordance with its terms. From and after the Effective Time: (i) each Science 37 Warrant assumed by us may be exercised solely for shares of our common stock; (ii) the number of shares of our common stock subject to each Science 37 Warrant assumed by us will be determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Science 37 Common Stock, or the number of shares of Science 37 Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Science 37 Warrant that were subject to such Science 37 Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number up to the nearest whole number of shares of our common stock; (iii) the per share exercise price for our common stock issuable upon exercise of each Science 37 Warrant assumed by us will be determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Science 37 Common Stock subject to the Science 37 Warrant, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Exchange Ratio and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and (iv) any restriction on any Science 37 Warrant assumed by us will continue in full force and effect and the terms and other provisions of such Science 37 Warrant will otherwise remain unchanged. The Exchange Ratio is defined in the Merger Agreement to be the quotient of (i) 100,000,000 divided by (ii) the number of shares of Science 37’s Fully Diluted Capital Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
Common Stock. At the Effective Time, following the Science 37 Preferred Stock Conversion, each share of Science 37 Common Stock (including shares of Science 37 Common Stock outstanding as a result of the Science 37 Preferred Stock Conversion, but excluding shares the holders of which perfect rights of appraisal under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive such number of shares of our common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (subject to rounding mechanisms as described in the Merger Agreement) and a number of Earn-Out Shares (as defined below).
Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Science 37 Common Stock, whether or not then vested and exercisable, will be converted automatically (and without any required action on the part of such holder of outstanding option) into an option to purchase shares of our common stock equal to the number of shares subject to such option prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, with the per share exercise price equal to the exercise price prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio.
Earn-Out Shares. Following the closing of the Merger, former holders of shares of Science 37 Common Stock (including shares received as a result of the Science 37 Preferred Stock Conversion) and former holders of Science 37 stock options will be entitled to receive their pro rata share of up to 12,500,000 additional shares of our common stock (the “Earn-Out Shares”) if, within a three-year period following May 6, 2021, the signing date of the Merger Agreement, the closing share price of our common stock equals or exceeds any of two thresholds over any 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period (each, a “Triggering Event”) and, in respect of a former holder of Science 37 stock options, the holder continues to provide services to us or one of our subsidiaries at the time of such Triggering Event.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties thereto. The consummation of the proposed Merger is subject to certain conditions as further described in the Merger Agreement.

Industry Opportunity
The healthcare industry consists of sectors within the economic system providing curative, preventive, rehabilitative, and palliative care for patients. The industry includes organizations providing such goods and services, as well as the doctors, nurses, and other healthcare employees. Total healthcare spending in the United States reached nearly $3.5 trillion in 2017 and is expected to grow by an average 5.6 percent annually over 2016-2025, according to a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services report released in February 2017. Total healthcare expenditures are thus expected to rise to 19.9 percent of the US Gross Domestic Product.
The healthcare market globally mirrors a similar trend in the US of an increased contribution to the economy, due to the aging of the global population and other durable macro dynamics. For example, in good part due to the impact of healthcare on society, life expectancy in the U.S. increased from 47 years in 1900 to 79 years in 2016. As a disproportionate amount of overall healthcare spending is associated with diseases of aging, the aging of the global population will continue to drive increased healthcare consumption. In addition, less developed countries have gone through an unprecedented period of healthcare insurance and infrastructure expansion that has led the countries to have significantly higher contributions to the global healthcare marketplace.
The target universe of healthcare opportunities is extensive, considering healthcare’s overall contribution to the economy. A factor that further broadens the universe is the high amount of innovation occurring within healthcare. In the wake of the genomics revolution, the pace of innovation is accelerating. With the streamlining of the externalization of breakthrough science from academic institutions, particularly in the United States, as mandates shifted from protecting intellectual property to externalizing it, increasing numbers of potentially disruptive healthcare innovations exist that may be underappreciated or underfunded. Early-stage companies need capital and advisory services to reach their commercial potential.
The healthcare industry is primed for new technologies and business models due to the increasing cost of healthcare and due to the increasing pressure to add value to the system. We believe that lower-value segments of healthcare will be burdened by the pressures of cost cutting, while companies or segments that deliver superior products and services, with better clinical and non-clinical outcomes, will thrive. Successful companies will be data driven, consumer focused, operationally efficient and transfer best-in-class standards globally. Our team takes a holistic approach to investment opportunities and conducts stringent due diligence to screen such companies. We see opportunities for companies that address global healthcare cost pressures by succeeding in disruptive innovation, thus justifying monies spent by delivering cures or other breakthrough outcomes; delivering cost savings to address global healthcare cost pressures; or providing access to medicines, as the marginal benefits from healthcare spending are highest when providing goods and services to those who do not already receive them.

Investment Criteria
We are focused on companies in disruptive and other value-added subsegments of healthcare that have the potential for significant gains in the next five years. Our ideal company will be institutionally backed, with a high-quality management team and a demonstrated ability to raise money from the private capital markets. The segments we will target include biotechnology, medical technology and digital health.
The focus of our management team is to create stockholder value by leveraging its experience to efficiently guide an emerging healthcare company towards commercialization. Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating prospective businesses, we may deviate from these criteria and guidelines should we see fit to do so.
Healthcare Company Poised for Rapid Growth
We intend to primarily seek to acquire one or more growth businesses with a total equity value of greater than 5 to 10 times the amount of the proceeds of our IPO. We believe that there are a substantial number of potential target businesses with appropriate valuations that can benefit from a public listing and new capital for growth to support significant revenue and earnings growth or to advance clinical programs. We do not intend to acquire a start-up company.
Niche Leader and Specialized Business with High Growth Potential
We intend to seek target companies that have significant and underexploited expansion opportunities in a niche sector. This can be accomplished through a combination of accelerating organic growth and finding attractive add-on acquisition targets. Our management team has significant experience in identifying such targets and in helping target management assess the strategic and financial fit. Similarly, our management team has the expertise to assess the likely synergies and a process to help a target integrate acquisitions. Additionally, our management team has extensive experience assisting healthcare companies raise money as they navigate the regulatory approval process.
Benefits from Being a U.S. Public Company (Value Creation and Marketing Opportunities)
We intend to seek target companies that should offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our stockholders. We intend to seek to acquire a target on terms and in a manner that leverage our experience. We expect to evaluate a company based on its potential to successfully achieve regulatory approval and commercialize its product(s). We also expect to evaluate financial returns based on (i) risk-adjusted peak sales potential (ii) the potential of pipeline products and the scientific platform (iii) the ability to achieve the system cost savings, (iv) the ability to accelerate growth via other options, including through the opportunity for follow-on acquisitions, and (v) the prospects for creating value through other value creation initiatives. Potential upside, for example, from the growth in the target business’ earnings or an improved capital structure, will be weighed against any identified downside risks.
Potential Benefit from Globalization Trends and Possession of Competitive Advantages
Target companies exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our company-specific analyses and due diligence. For a potential target company, this process will include, among other things, a review and analysis of the company’s capital structure, quality of current or future earnings, preclinical or clinical data, potential for operational improvements, corporate governance, customers, material contracts, and the industry and trends. We intend to leverage the operational experience and disciplined investment approach of our team to identify opportunities to unlock value that our experience in complex situations allows us to pursue.
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.

10



Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Employees
We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
