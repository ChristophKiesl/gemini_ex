ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Galena Biopharma, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Galena” or the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company developing hematology and oncology therapeutics that address unmet medical needs. The Company’s pipeline consists of multiple mid- to late-stage clinical assets, including our hematology asset, GALE-401, and our novel cancer immunotherapy programs including NeuVax™ (nelipepimut-S), GALE-301 and GALE-302. GALE-401 is a controlled release version of the approved drug anagrelide for the treatment of elevated platelets in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. GALE- 401 has completed a Phase 2 clinical trial and the asset is ready to advance into a pivotal trial in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). NeuVax is currently in multiple investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trials in breast cancer. GALE-301 and GALE-302 have completed early stage trials in ovarian, endometrial and breast cancers. 
We are seeking to build value for shareholders through pursuit of the following objectives: 

• | Develop hematology and oncology assets through clinical development with a focus in areas of unmet medical need. Our hematology asset is targeting the treatment of patients with ET to reduce elevated platelet counts. Our immunotherapy programs are currently targeting two key areas: secondary prevention intended to significantly decrease the risk of disease recurrence in breast, gastric, and ovarian cancers; and primary prevention intended to prevent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) from becoming invasive breast cancer.


• | Evaluating strategic alternatives that may include continuing to advance the clinical programs as a stand-alone entity, a sale of the company, a business combination, merger or reverse merger, and a license or other disposition of corporate assets of the company.


• | Leverage partnerships and collaborations, as well as investigator-sponsored trial arrangements, to maximize the scope of potential clinical opportunities in a cost effective and efficient manner.

Hematology 
GALE-401 (anagrelide controlled release (CR)) 
GALE-401 contains the active ingredient anagrelide, an FDA-approved product, for the treatment of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (“MPNs”) to lower abnormally elevated platelet levels. The currently available immediate release (“IR”) version of anagrelide causes adverse events that are believed to be dose and plasma concentration dependent, and may limit the use of the IR version of the drug. Therefore, reducing the maximum concentration (“Cmax”) and increasing the half-life of the drug is hypothesized to reduce the side effects, while preserving the efficacy, potentially allowing a broader use of the drug. 
Multiple Phase 1 studies in 98 healthy subjects have shown GALE-401 reduces the Cmax of anagrelide and increases the half-life following oral administration, appears to be well tolerated at the doses administered, and to be capable of reducing platelet levels effectively. The Phase 1 program provided the desired PK/PD (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) profile to enable the initiation of the Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial. The Phase 2, open label, single arm, proof-of concept trial enrolled 18 patients in the United States for the treatment of thrombocytosis, or elevated platelet counts, in patients with MPNs. Final safety and efficacy data from this Phase 2 trial were presented in December 2015 and demonstrated a prolonged clinical benefit with a potentially improved safety profile. 
We have analyzed our data and the treatment landscape for MPNs, with a current focus on Essential Thrombocythemia (“ET”). Subject to completion of the manufacturing of the new formulation and other internal work, GALE-401 is ready to advance into a Phase 3 clinical trial in ET patients who are intolerant or resistant to hydroxyurea. The trial is designed to compare GALE-401 (drug arm) versus best available therapy (BAT) to include a sizable population of patients treated with anagrelide IR. A productive meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2016 confirmed that the GALE-401 development program is appropriate for a New Drug Application (NDA) filing using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. 
Essential Thrombocythemia is a myeloproliferative blood disorder, and is characterized by the overproduction of platelets in the bone marrow. Elevated platelets alter the normal process of blood coagulation and can lead to thromboembolic events. About a third of patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. However, many patients develop symptoms during the course of the disease that affect the quality of life. 
Novel Cancer Immunotherapies 
Our targeted cancer immunotherapy approach is currently based upon two key areas: preventing secondary recurrence of cancer, which is becoming increasingly important as the number of cancer survivors continues to grow; and, primary prevention intended to prevent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) from becoming invasive breast cancer. Once a patient’s tumor becomes metastatic, the outcome is often fatal, making the prevention of recurrence a potentially critical component of overall patient care. Our secondary recurrence programs primarily target patients in the adjuvant (after-surgery) setting who have relatively healthy immune systems, but may still have residual disease. Minimal residual disease, or micrometastasis, that are undetectable by current radiographic scanning technologies, can result in disease recurrence. 
Our therapies utilize an immunodominant peptide combined with the immune adjuvant, recombinant human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF), and work by harnessing the patient’s own immune system to seek out and attack any residual cancer cells. Using peptide immunogens has many potential clinical advantages, including a favorable safety profile, since these drugs may lack the toxicities typical of most cancer therapies. They also have the potential to induce immunologic memory and provide long-lasting protection with a convenient, intradermal mode of delivery.

NeuVax™ (nelipepimut-S) 
NeuVax™ (nelipepimut-S) is a cancer immunotherapy targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) expressing cancers. NeuVax is the immunodominant nonapeptide derived from the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein, a well-established and validated target for therapeutic intervention in breast and gastric carcinomas. The NeuVax vaccine is combined with GM-CSF for injection under the skin, or intradermal administration. Data has shown that an increased presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may predict reduced Disease Free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS) suggesting a presence of isolated micrometastases, not detectable clinically, but, over time, can lead to recurrence of cancer, most often in distant sites. After binding to the specific HLA molecules on antigen presenting cells, the nelipepimut-S sequence stimulates specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, or CTLs, causing significant clonal expansion. These activated CTLs recognize, neutralize and destroy, through cell lysis, HER2 expressing cancer cells, including occult cancer cells and micrometastatic foci. The nelipepimut immune response can also generate CTLs to other immunogenic peptides through inter- and intra-antigenic epitope spreading. 
Breast Cancer: According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), over 230,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with breast cancer annually. While improved diagnostics and targeted therapies have decreased breast cancer mortality in the U.S., metastatic breast cancer remains incurable. Approximately 75% to 80% of breast cancer patients have tissue test positive for some increased amount of the HER2 receptor, which is associated with disease progression and decreased survival. Only approximately 20% to 30% of all breast cancer patients-those with HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ disease, or IHC 2+ and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) amplified-have a HER2 directed, approved treatment option available after their initial standard of care. This leaves the majority of breast cancer patients with low-to-intermediate HER2 expression (IHC 1+, 2+) ineligible for therapy and without an effective targeted treatment option to prevent cancer recurrence. 
We currently have two investigator-sponsored trials (IST) ongoing with NeuVax in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin®; Genentech/Roche). The combination of trastuzumab and NeuVax has been shown pre-clinically and in a pilot study to be synergistic. Our Phase 2b clinical trial is a randomized, multicenter, investigator-sponsored, 300 patient study enrolling HER2 1+ and 2+, HLA A2+, A3+, A24 and/or A26, node positive, and high-risk node negative patients. Eligible patients are randomized to receive NeuVax + GM-CSF + trastuzumab or trastuzumab + GM-CSF alone. The primary endpoint of the study is disease-free survival. Genentech/Roche is providing the trastuzumab and partial funding for this trial. Data presented in October 2016 demonstrated that this novel combination of trastuzumab and NeuVax with HER2 low-expressing patients is well tolerated and the cardiac effects of trastuzumab are not impacted by the addition of NeuVax. In February 2017, the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reported that there were no safety concerns with the trial and the trial is not futile. The recommendation from the DSMB was to continue the trial with one revision to the statistical analysis plan regarding the timing of the pre-specified interim analysis. Given the lengthy duration of enrollment for the trial, the DSMB determined that the pre-specified interim efficacy analysis be moved up from 12 months to 6 months after the last patient is enrolled. Completion of enrollment is expected in the second quarter of 2017; therefore, the DSMB expects to perform the interim efficacy analysis near the end of 2017. 
Our second combination IST is a Phase 2 in HER2 3+ breast cancer patients who have completed neoadjuvant therapy with an approved regimen that includes trastuzumab and fail to achieve a pathological complete response, meaning they have microscopic evidence of residual disease and are therefore at an increased risk of disease recurrence. This multi-center, prospective, randomized, single-blinded Phase 2 trial is enrolling approximately 100 patients with a diagnosis of HER2 3+ breast cancer who are HLA A2+ or HLA A3+ and are determined to be at high-risk for recurrence. High-risk is defined as having received neoadjuvant therapy with an approved regimen that includes trastuzumab but not obtaining a pathological complete response at surgery, or those who undergo surgery as a first intervention and are found to be pathologically node-positive. These high-risk patients are known to have higher recurrence rates than other HER2 3+ breast cancer patients. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive NeuVax + GM-CSF + trastuzumab or trastuzumab + GM-CSF alone. The primary endpoint of the study is disease-free survival. Funding for this trial was awarded through the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP), funded through the Department of Defense (DoD), via a Breast Cancer Research Program (BCRP) Breakthrough Award. In February 2017, the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reported that there were no safety concerns with the trial and the trial is not futile. The pre-specified interim safety analysis was also completed on n=50 patients and demonstrated that the agent is well tolerated with no increased cardiotoxicity associated with giving NeuVax in combination with trastuzumab. The recommendation from the DSMB was to continue the HER2 3+ trial unmodified.

A Phase 2 trial clinical with NeuVax as a single agent in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, is open for enrollment. The trial is being run in collaboration with the NCI, potentially positioning NeuVax as a treatment for earlier stage disease. The trial has an immunological endpoint evaluating NeuVax peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL; CD8+ T-cell) response in vaccinated patients. DCIS is defined by the NCI as a noninvasive condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct and have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast. DCIS is the most common type of breast cancer. In some cases, DCIS may become invasive cancer and spread to other tissues, and at this time, there is no way to know which lesions could become invasive. Current treatment options for DCIS include breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy with or without tamoxifen, breast-conserving surgery without radiation therapy, or total mastectomy with or without tamoxifen. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2015 there were over 60,000 diagnoses of DCIS. 
A Phase 3 PRESENT (Prevention of Recurrence in Early-Stage, Node- Positive Breast Cancer with Low to Intermediate HER2 Expression with NeuVax Treatment) study enrolled 758 HER2 1+/2+ patients who are node-positive and HLA A2 or A3 positive. On June 27, 2016, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, recommended that the Phase 3 PRESENT clinical trial be stopped for futility. The PRESENT trial was stopped, and we initiated an investigation into the causes of the recommendation. Our analysis of the data showed that there was a separation of the curves, albeit not statistically significant, with the control arm performing better than expected and the NeuVax arm performing consistent with our protocol assumptions for the control group. Because the study was deemed futile, we closed the PRESENT trial, and we expect to present the data at a future medical conference. 
Gastric Cancer: According to the NCI, gastric (stomach) cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lining of the stomach. Almost all gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas (cancers that begin in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids). Other types of gastric cancer are gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and lymphomas. Infection with bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is thought to be the cause of gastric cancer and age, diet, and stomach disease can affect the risk of developing gastric cancer. Gastric cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage because there are no early signs or symptoms, and is the second-most common cancer among males and third-most common among females in Asia and worldwide with over 63,000 new cases a year in India, where an initial clinical trial of NeuVax is planned. Overexpression of the HER2 receptor occurs in approximately 20% of gastric and gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinomas, predominantly those of the intestinal type. Overall, without regard to the stage of cancer, only approximately 28% of patients with stomach cancer live at least five years following diagnosis and new adjuvant treatments are needed to prevent disease recurrence. We currently have an agreement with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories to conduct a Phase 2 investigational study in gastric cancer in India. 
GALE-301 and GALE-302 
Our second immunotherapy franchise targets folate binding protein (FBP) receptor-alpha. FBP is a well-validated therapeutic target that is highly over-express in ovarian, endometrial and breast cancers, and is the source of immunogenic peptides that can stimulate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to recognize and destroy FBP-expressing cancer cells. Current treatments after surgery for these diseases are principally with platinum based chemotherapeutic agents. These patients suffer a high recurrence rate and most relapse with an extremely poor prognosis. GALE-301 and GALE-302 are immunogenic peptides that consist of a peptide derived from FBP combined with GM-CSF for the prevention of cancer recurrence in the adjuvant setting. GALE-301 is the E39 peptide, while GALE-302 is an attenuated version of this peptide, known as E39’. Two early stage clinical trials have been completed with our FBP peptides in ovarian, endometrial, and breast cancers. In June 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted two orphan-drug designations for the treatment (including prevention of recurrence) of ovarian cancer: one for GALE-301 (E39), and one for GALE-301 (E39) and GALE-302 (E39’).

 Ovarian Cancer: According to the NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, new cases of ovarian cancer occur at an annual rate of 11.9 per 100,000 women in the U.S., with an estimated 22,280 new cases and 14,240 deaths in 2016. Only 46.2% of ovarian cancer patients are expected to survive five years after diagnosis. Approximately 1.3% of women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer at some point during their lifetime (2011 - 2013 data). The prevalence data from 2013 showed an estimated 195,767 women living with ovarian cancer in the United States. Due to the lack of specific symptoms, the majority of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed at later stages of the disease, with an estimated 80% of women presenting with advanced-stage (III or IV) disease. These patients have their tumors routinely surgically debulked to minimal residual disease, and then are treated with platinum- and/or taxane-based chemotherapy. While many patients respond to this treatment regimen and become clinically free-of-disease, the majority of these patients will relapse. Depending upon their level of residual disease, the risk for recurrence after completion of primary therapy is approximately 70%. Unfortunately, for these women, once the disease recurs, treatment options are limited and the disease is most likely incurable.

Recent Developments (in reverse chronological order) 
Evaluation of Strategic Alternatives and Resignation of President and Chief Executive Officer. 
On January 31, 2017, the Board of Directors announced that it is in the process of engaging an outside advisor to evaluate strategic alternatives for the company focused on maximizing stockholder value. On March 9, 2017, it was announced that Canaccord Genuity, Inc. was engaged as the Company's financial advisor to assist in the review process. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated as part of this review include continuing to advance the clinical programs as a stand-alone entity, a sale of the company, a business combination, merger or reverse merger, and a license or other disposition of corporate assets of the company. There is no set timetable for this process and there can be no assurance that this process will result in a transaction. On January 31, 2017, the Company also announced the resignation of Mark W. Schwartz, Ph.D., from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the board of directors of each of Galena Biopharma, Inc. and our Apthera, Inc. and Mills Pharmaceutical, LLC and subsidiaries. 
Appointment of Interim Chief Executive Officer
On February 21, 2017, our Board of Directors appointed Mr. Stephen Ghiglieri to be our Interim Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Mr. Ghiglieri previously held the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). He will continue to serve as the Company’s CFO, a position to which he was appointed in November 2016.
Closed a Public Offering of Common Stock and Warrants
On February 13, 2017, we closed the previously announced underwritten public offering of common stock and warrants. The net proceeds to us were approximately $15.5 million.
Positive Outcome from the Data Safety Monitoring Board on the Two NeuVax Clinical Trials in Combination with Trastuzumab 
On February 6, 2017, we reported the results from a meeting of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the two investigator-sponsored (IST) combination clinical trials with NeuVax plus trastuzumab. The DSMB reported that there are no safety concerns with either trial and neither was found to be futile. For the Phase 2b trial in patients with low-to-intermediate HER2 expression (HER2 1+/2+), n=242 patients were evaluated, and the recommendation from the DSMB is to continue the trial with one revision to the statistical analysis plan regarding the timing of the pre-specified interim analysis. Given the lengthy duration of enrollment for the trial, the DSMB determined that the pre-specified interim efficacy analysis be moved up from 12 months to 6 months after the last patient is enrolled. Completion of enrollment is expected in the second quarter of 2017; therefore, the DSMB expects to perform the interim efficacy analysis near the end of 2017. For the Phase 2 trial in high-risk, HER2 3+ patients, and per the trial protocol, the pre-specified interim safety analysis was also completed on n=50 patients and demonstrated that the agent is well tolerated with no increased cardiotoxicity associated with giving NeuVax in combination with trastuzumab. These findings were similar to the findings presented in October 2016 from the HER2 1+/2+ trial. The recommendation from the DSMB is to continue the HER2 3+ trial unmodified.
FDA Confirms 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for GALE-401 Phase 3 Trial 
On December 28, 2017, we announced that after a productive meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Agency confirmed that the GALE-401 development program is appropriate for a New Drug Application (NDA) filing using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in patients with ET who are intolerant to or failed to achieve an optimal response with hydroxyurea.

Settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
On December 22, 2016, Galena and its former CEO reached an agreement in principle to a proposed settlement that would resolve an investigation by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) involving conduct in the period 2012-2014 regarding the commissioning of internet publications by outside promotional firms. The proposed settlement is subject to approval by the Commission and would acknowledge our cooperation in the investigation and confirm our voluntary undertaking to continue that cooperation. If the Commission does not approve the settlement, we may need to enter into further discussions with the SEC staff to resolve the investigated matters on different terms and conditions. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the final terms of any resolution including its financial impact or any future adjustment to the financial statements.
Announced the Phase 2 Clinical Trial of NeuVax in DCIS is Open for Enrollment and Screening Patients
On December 14, 2016, the Company announced the NeuVax Phase 2 clinical trial entitled VADIS: Phase 2 trial of the Nelipepimut-S Peptide VAccine in Women with DCIS of the Breast is now open for enrollment and screening patients. The trial is being run in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Phase I and II Chemoprevention Consortium.
Presented Two Posters at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium
On December 12, 2016, we announced that two posters were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). The poster, entitled, “ VADIS trial: Phase 2 trial of the nelipepimut-S peptide vaccine in women with DCIS of the breast,” presented the trial design for the planned, Phase 2 investigator-sponsored clinical trial with NeuVax in patients with DCIS. The poster, entitled, “ Determining the optimal vaccination strategy using a combination of the folate binding protein (FBP) peptide vaccine (E39+GM-CSF) and an attenuated version (E39’) to maximize the immunologic response in breast cancer patients,” was presented on the breast cancer patients in the Company’s GALE-301 (E39) and GALE-302 (E39’) Phase 1b clinical trial targeting Folate Binding Protein. In the trial, both the E39 and E39’ peptide vaccines were noted to be well tolerated and immunogenic with no clinicopathologic differences between groups. Local reaction increased in all groups with administration of the vaccine as measured and assessed using orthogonal means. The greatest increase was seen in the treatment arm that administered GALE-301 followed by GALE-302, which approached statistical significance, and this arm was also the only arm with a statistically significant increase in DTH.
Presented GALE-301/GALE-302 Phase 1b Data
On November 14, 2016, data from our GALE-301/GALE-302 clinical program was presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Conference 2016 in National Harbor, Maryland. The presentation, entitled, “Phase Ib Trial of Two Folate Binding Protein (FBP) Peptide Booster Vaccines (E39 and E39’) in Breast and Ovarian Cancer Patients,” reported the peptide-specific immune response to E39 and E39’ after different combinations of vaccination and boosting. The data showed that both E39 and E39’ are well tolerated with all related adverse events at grade 1 or grade 2. Though numbers were small, patients boosted with the attenuated peptide showed increased CTL response to boosting regardless of significant residual immunity (SRI) resulting from the primary vaccination series (PVS). While this data needs to be confirmed with a larger sample size, this is consistent with the theoretical advantage of boosting with an attenuated peptide, which is expected to induce less antigen-induced cell death of CTLs.
Announced a Reverse Stock Split
On October 31, 2016, we announced a reverse stock split of our shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-20 as approved by the Board of Directors on October 26, 2016. The reverse stock split was authorized by the Company’s stockholders at the Special Meeting of Stockholders held on October 21, 2016. The reverse stock split became effective on November 11, 2016 and the Company’s common stock commenced trading on a split-adjusted basis on Wednesday, November 14, 2016 under the symbol “GALE” but under the new CUSIP number 363256504.

Presented GALE-301/GALE-302 Phase 1b Data
On October 20, 2016, Dr. Doreen Jackson delivered a podium presentation on our GALE-301 and GALE-302 clinical program at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress 2016. The Phase 1b is a single-center, randomized, single-blinded, three-arm study in patients with breast or ovarian cancer diagnosis who were treated with standard of care and were without evidence of disease. The presentation was entitled, “A Phase Ib Trial Comparing Different Doses/Schedules of a Folate Binding Protein (FBP)-derived Peptide Vaccine, E39, and its Attenuated Version, E39’, to Induce Long-term FBP- specific Immunity in Disease-free Cancer Patients.” In this trial, which enrolled mostly breast cancer patients who have lower FBP exposure than ovarian patients, the 500mcg dose appears to provide a more optimal immunological response. This differs from the results in ovarian cancer patients, who have much higher FBP expression, with potential secondary immune tolerance, where 1000mcg was the optimal dose. E39’ (GALE-302) given after E39 (GALE-301) was able to induce long-term immunity in both dosing cohorts, underscoring the potential importance of attenuated peptides in relatively antigen-naïve patients.
Presented NeuVax plus Trastuzumab Interim Safety Data
On October 10, 2016, we presented interim safety data from the NeuVax Phase 2b combination study with trastuzumab at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2016. The clinical trial is a randomized, multicenter, investigator-sponsored, 300 patient Phase 2b study enrolling HER2 1+ and 2+ node positive, and high-risk node negative patients. The poster, entitled “Interim safety analysis of a phase II trial combining trastuzumab and NeuVax, a HER2-targeted peptide vaccine, to prevent breast cancer recurrence in HER2 low expression,” demonstrated that this novel combination of trastuzumab and NeuVax in HER2 low-expressing patients is well-tolerated and the cardiac effects of trastuzumab are not impacted by the addition of NeuVax.

Competition
The biotechnology industry, including cancer immunotherapy vaccines and hematology therapies, is intensely competitive and involves a high degree of risk. Potential competitors in the U.S. and worldwide are numerous and include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, educational institutions and research foundations. We compete with many of these companies who have far greater experience, capital resources, research and technical resources, marketing experience, research and development staffs and facilities than us. Some of our competitors may develop and commercialize products that compete directly with those incorporating our technology, and they may introduce products to market earlier than our products or on a more cost effective basis. We may be unable to effectively develop our technology or any other applications on a cost effective basis or otherwise. In addition, our technology may be subject to competition from other technology or methods developed using techniques other than those developed by traditional biotechnology methods. Our competitors compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our technology. We, and our collaborators, may face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety, ease of use and adaptability to various modes of administration, acceptance by physicians, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, availability of resources, reimbursement coverage, price, and patent position including potentially dominant patent positions of others. 
For patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), current treatment options include Agrylin® (anagrelide hydrochloride) and its generic equivalents, hydorxyurea and interferon alpha. Agents currently being studied in patients with MPNs include investigational JAK2 inhibitors (e.g., LY2784544 (Eli Lily), momelotinib (Gilead Sciences) and pegylated interferon alfa-2a (Pegasys, Genentech/Roche)).
For patients with early stage breast cancer, adjuvant therapy is often given to prevent recurrence and increase the chance of long-term disease free survival. Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer can include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, or combinations thereof. In addition, the HER2 targeted drug trastuzumab (Herceptin®) may be given to patients with tumors with high expression of HER2 (IHC 3+), as well as other novel targets such as MUC1 which may be useful in treating breast cancer.
There are a number of cancer vaccines in development for breast cancer, including but not limited to Lapuleucel-T (Dendreon), AE-37 (Antigen Express), and Stimuvax (Merck KgA). While these development candidates are aimed at a number of different targets, and AE-37 has published data in the HER2 breast cancer patient population, there is no guarantee that any of the these compounds will not in the future be indicated for treatment of low-to-intermediate HER2 breast cancer patients and become directly competitive with NeuVax.
A number of chemotherapeutic agents have demonstrated activity in gynecological carcinomas (ovarian and endometrial), particularly platinum based regimens. New chemotherapy agents are being evaluated including trabectedin (Yondelis) and belotecan as well as targeted agents such as bevacizumab (Avastin) and pazopanib (Avotrient). Monoclonal antibodies are also being developed including farletuzumab and catumaxomab. The Company is not aware of any of these agents being evaluated in the adjuvant setting where GALE-301 is being considered for further development. TPIV200 (TapImmune) is in development targeting FBP in ovarian cancer.

Government Regulation
The U.S. and other developed countries extensively regulate the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution of drugs and biologic products. The FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations.
To obtain approval of our future product candidates from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting safety and efficacy for the intended indication as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate. In most cases, this will require extensive laboratory tests and preclinical and clinical trials. The collection of these data, as well as the preparation of applications for review by the FDA involve significant time and expense. The FDA may require post-marketing testing to monitor the safety and efficacy of approved products or place conditions on any product approvals that could restrict the therapeutic claims and commercial applications of these products. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals if we fail to comply with regulatory standards and or the conditions of the regulatory approval at any time following initial marketing of our products.
The amount of time taken by the FDA for approval of an NDA or Biologics License Application (BLA) will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the product candidate has received priority review or fast track designation, the quality of the submission and studies presented, and the workload at the FDA.
We anticipate that our products will be manufactured by our strategic partners, licensees or other third parties. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities are in compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”), which are regulations that govern the manufacture, holding and distribution of a product. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the FDA’s general biological product standards. Our manufacturers also will be subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Nuclear Energy and Radiation Control Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other applicable environmental statutes. Following approval, the FDA periodically inspects drug and biologic manufacturing facilities to ensure continued compliance with the good manufacturing practices regulations. Our manufacturers will have to continue to comply with those requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing or recall or seizure of product. Adverse patient experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or market removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval.
The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product also must be in compliance with FDA and Federal Trade Commission requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet, and direct-to-consumer advertising. In addition, we will be subject to various laws and regulations governing laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of product approvals, seize or recall products, and deny or withdraw approvals.
We will also be subject to a variety of regulations governing clinical trials and sales of our products outside the U.S. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product candidate by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries and regions must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from one regulatory authority to another and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In the European Union, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar, in principle, to those in the U.S.

Financial Condition
We had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $29.1 million as of February 28, 2017. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, funding available under our Lincoln Park Capital, LLC (LPC) purchase agreement and At The Market Issuance Sales Agreements (ATM), should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least one year. This projection is based on our current limited operations and estimates of legal expenses associated with the ongoing government investigation and legal matters pending against the company, and is subject to changes in our operating plans, resolutions of such government investigation and legal matters, uncertainties inherent in our business, strategic alternatives outcomes, and the need to seek to replenish our existing cash and cash equivalents sooner than we project and in greater amounts that we had projected. There is no guarantee that any debt, additional equity or other funding will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional funding when needed, we would be forced to scale back, or terminate, our operations or to seek to merge with or to be acquired by another company.
On February 13, 2017, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of 17,000,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 17,000,000 shares of common stock priced at $1.00 per share and accompanying warrant. The warrants are immediately exercisable with a strike price of $1.10 and will expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance. The net proceeds of the February 2017 Offering were $15.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by the Company.
In addition to the proceeds from the February 2017 Offering, in January and February 2017 the holder of the Debenture redeemed $3.95 million of outstanding principal that was satisfied by the Company with 3,518,663 shares of our common stock. The Company was able to transfer the $3.95 million out of restricted cash and cash equivalents and into unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to be used to fund the Company's ongoing operations. The outstanding principal balance as of March 15, 2017 is $13,617,702. 
On January 31, 2017, the Company announced that it is in the process of evaluating strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated as part of this review include continuing to advance the clinical programs as a stand-alone entity, a sale of the company, a business combination, merger or reverse merger, and a license or other disposition of corporate assets of the company. There is no set timetable for this process and there can be no assurance that this process will result in a transaction. While the Company evaluates its strategic alternatives, Galena’s investigator-sponsored immunotherapy trials will remain ongoing. With the confirmation from the FDA that the GALE-401 development program is appropriate for a New Drug Application (NDA) filing using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in patients with ET who are intolerant or resistant to hydroxyurea, we have developed a clear path forward for GALE-401 in the treatment of ET. Subject to completing the manufacturing of the new formulation and the internal work to prepare the Phase 3 trial for initiation, the Company is evaluating the appropriate time to commence enrollment of the GALE-401 trial and anticipates making a definitive determination in the second half of 2017. The Company has focused on reducing expenditures in order to preserve liquidity while pursuing a strategic alternative.
In addition to the funds raised through underwritten public offerings and the debenture, we maintain a purchase agreement with LPC and ATM with future availability of $2.0 million and $19.1 million, respectively subject to certain terms and conditions. On February 6, 2017, the Company and LPC amended the Purchase Agreement, as amended, to decrease the value of Common Stock that the Company may sell to LPC from $42.2 million to $2.0 million, a reduction of $39.4 million of availability. We may also continue to use the ATM, or other instruments, in order to fund our operations going forward.
We expect to continue to incur operating losses as we advance our product candidates through the drug development and the regulatory process. In the absence of revenue, our potential sources of operational funding are proceeds from the sale of equity, funded research and development payments, debt financing arrangements, and payments received under partnership and collaborative agreements.

Environmental Compliance
Our development programs involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specific waste products. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be significant and may adversely affect capital expenditures to the extent we are required to procure expensive capital equipment to meet regulatory requirements.
Human Resources
As of March 15, 2017, the Company had 14 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppages.
