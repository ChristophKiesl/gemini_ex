In July 2017, an additional 481,000 shares were issued to shareholders of Jericho under the same contingencies as the original shares.  The Equity Purchase Agreement provided that by September 24, 2017, if the management of Jericho does not identify at least one entity or business opportunity for acquisition, in order to supplement the Company’s current business operations, the shares issued as part of the agreement shall be returned to the Company and the transaction will be nullified.  On September 22, 2017, the Company and Jericho mutually agreed to extend the performance requirement until December 24, 2017.

Principal services
 Once the merger with Jericho finalizes, the Company will operate two business divisions, which will be operated simultaneously and consist of the following:
  
The concrete leveling division of the business will fabricate and market a concrete leveling service unit utilized in the concrete leveling industry. This unit secures to the back of a truck and consists of a mixing device to mix lime with water and a pumping device capable of pumping the mixture under pressure into pre-drilled holes in order to raise the level of any flat concrete surface.
 
The gaming and hospitality division of the business will focus on casino gaming, hospitality, entertainment and leisure time industries, and will pursue opportunities in the tribal and commercial casino gaming industries, both in California and Nevada.  The Company will also operate in the casino gaming technology industry, and is seeking opportunities to partner, joint venture, or acquire companies developing casino games that combine traditional casino games with the challenge of video games and the playability of social games, meaning games that pit the player’s skill against the skill of another player as opposed to the casino itself.
 
Organization
 We are comprised of the parent company Concrete Leveling Systems, Inc., and a wholly owned subsidiary, Jericho Associates, Inc. As of July 31, 2017, Jericho had no assets, liabilities or operations.
Strategy
 Structured as a concrete leveling services provider, as well as a casino gaming, hospitality, and entertainment company, and our business model is designed to partner with third parties in the casino and hospitality industries, which will also allow us to further develop and utilize our concrete leveling division if we are able to enter into agreements that will result in the construction of any “brick and mortar” structures.
