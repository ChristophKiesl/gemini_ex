Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a global medical technology company that develops and commercializes products to treat urinary and fecal dysfunction, including: (i) an implantable sacral neuromodulation (SNM) system to treat urinary urge incontinence (UUI) and urinary urgency frequency (UUF), together referred to as overactive bladder (OAB), fecal incontinence (FI), and non-obstructive urinary retention (UR); and (ii) a urethral bulking agent to treat female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). 
SNM System
OAB affects an estimated 87 million adults in the United States and Europe. Another estimated 40 million adults are reported to suffer from FI. SNM therapy is an effective and durable treatment that has been widely used and reimbursed in Europe and the United States for the past two decades. SNM is the only OAB treatment with proven clinical superiority to standard medical therapy and OAB patients who receive SNM report significantly higher quality of life than patients undergoing drug treatment.
We estimate the global SNM market is now approximately $650 million to $700 million and believe it is a growing market that is currently about one to three percent penetrated. Until we entered the market, it was serviced by Medtronic as a single participant. 
We believe our proprietary rechargeable SNM system (r-SNM System), the first rechargeable SNM system marketed worldwide, offers significant advantages, and is well positioned to capture market share and penetrate and grow this attractive market. Our r-SNM System is designed to last approximately 15 years in the human body, is only 5cc in volume, offers broad MRI access, ease of use, intuitive programmers, and the longest recharging interval among rechargeable SNM systems.
We began U.S. commercialization of our r-SNM System in the middle of the fourth quarter of 2019 after receiving approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We also have marketing approvals in Europe, Canada, and Australia for all relevant clinical indications.
During 2020 and early 2021, we received six additional FDA approvals for enhancements to our product offering, including a second-generation rechargeable implantable neurostimulator (INS) with a one-month recharging interval, a new patient remote control with SmartMRITM technology, 3 Tesla MRI full-body conditional labeling, a second-generation recharging belt, an upgraded programmer and a third-generation INS which gives patients the ability to make broader stimulation parameter adjustments at home.
We believe that SNM therapy is an effective treatment alternative for patients with bladder and bowel dysfunction whose symptoms have not been adequately resolved by first and second-line therapies. We believe that approximately two-thirds of patients in the United States with bladder and bowel dysfunction that are treated with SNM therapy have either UUI alone, UUI in combination with FI or another subtype of OAB. We believe that approximately 85% of the SNM addressable market for OAB consists of female patients. Anatomical and physiological differences in the lower urinary tract of males and females may help to explain these variations.
First-line therapies for OAB include behavioral changes such as diet, exercise, timed voiding, pelvic floor exercises, and biofeedback, all of which often have limited effectiveness. Second-line therapies for OAB consist of drug therapy and medical management, and may be effective; however, the use of medication can cause undesirable side effects and the effectiveness may decrease over time with prolonged use. First- and second-line therapies comprise the largest segment of the treatment market for OAB. Patients who fail, or are contraindicated or refractory for, both first- and second-line therapies may be eligible for SNM as a third-line therapy.
SNM therapy has been commercially available in the United States for over 20 years and has been clinically proven to provide a safe, effective, reversible, and long-lasting solution. According to a study published in the Journal of Neurourology and Urodynamics, Siegel et al. in 2014, SNM therapy is the only third-line therapy for OAB that has objectively demonstrated superior efficacy to standard OAB medical therapy. Relative to the other third-line therapies such as onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX) injections and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) we believe SNM therapy has therapeutic advantages that include better efficacy and patient compliance.
We believe that our r-SNM System offers similar therapeutic benefits and competitive advantages to the only other currently available SNM technologies, InterStim II and Interstim Micro, both offered by Medtronic. As a result of our long-lived implantable device, patients implanted with our r-SNM System do not need to undergo replacement surgery every three to five years, as is the case for patients implanted with InterStim II, potentially reducing the risks of surgery and associated infections. We believe patients who have historically resisted SNM therapy because of the required multiple surgeries may be more inclined to be treated by our r-SNM System. Our r-SNM System allows full-body MRI scans and head scans under certain conditions. This full-body MRI feature may allow more patients to choose SNM therapy to treat their bladder and bowel dysfunction.
We have designed and developed a proprietary method protected by patents, know-how, and trade secrets that enables us to combine ceramic and titanium to fabricate the INS enclosure of our r-SNM System. This method enables us to incorporate a significantly smaller battery and recharging coil into our INS, which enables us to provide a smaller sized implant that is half the weight of InterStim II while offering twice the recharging interval (one month vs. two weeks) as Interstim Micro. In addition, we engineered the INS to deliver constant-current stimulation, which automatically adjusts stimulation based on changes to impedance that occur as the implanted lead scars into the body, which we expect will provide a more consistent and reliable therapy over time and reduce patient and physician management of the therapy. Our r-SNM System also includes an easy-to-use patient remote control. We also designed and custom built a clinician programmer that guides the implanting physician through electrode placement and stimulation programming.
Our r-SNM System consists of several components and accessories that provide a smoothly integrated, long-lasting, intuitive, and easy-to-use system. The miniaturized INS is a five cubic centimeter, rechargeable implantable stimulator designed to provide stimulation through a tined four-electrode lead. SNM therapy generally consists of two phases, an evaluation period, also called the external trial period, which typically lasts a few days to a few weeks, and a permanent implant for those patients who experience a successful external trial period. The permanent implant procedure typically occurs in a hospital or an outpatient setting and includes implantation of the INS and, if a temporary lead was used for the external trial period, implantation of the permanent lead. The INS is inserted through a small incision into a pocket in the subcutaneous fat of the upper buttocks, and the lead body is tunneled to the INS pocket and connected to the INS. The INS is programmed by, and wirelessly communicates with, the clinician programmer, at a range of up to approximately three feet. The patient has the ability to adjust stimulation intensity up or down or switch on or off, using a discrete, small, and easy-to-use wireless remote control that communicates with the device at a range of up to approximately three feet. The INS charges wirelessly for approximately one hour once a month under normal use conditions.
We intend to continue to invest in research and development activities focused on improvements and enhancements to our r-SNM System. Our goals include expanding the suite of product solutions available for SNM therapy, including a non-rechargeable SNM device that utilizes a primary cell battery. 
We focus the significant majority of our sales and marketing efforts in the United States where reimbursement for SNM therapy is well established and covered by most major U.S. insurers, including Medicare. Additionally, we hire and train sales representatives and clinical specialists with strong backgrounds and experience in SNM therapy and other neurostimulation applications, and who have existing relationships with urologists and urogynecologists. We are initially targeting the estimated top 1,000 physicians that represent a majority of the implant volume in the United States. We estimate that approximately 80% of U.S. implant volume is generated by these 1,000 physicians.
Urethral Bulking Agent
On February 25, 2021, we announced the acquisition of Contura Limited (Contura) and its Bulkamid product, a urethral bulking agent indicated for the treatment of female SUI. In consideration for the acquisition, we paid approximately $141.3 million in cash and issued 1,096,583 shares of our common stock. We may pay an additional $35 million in the event Bulkamid sales in any consecutive 12-month period exceed $50 million before December 31, 2024. 
As part of the transaction, we entered into a supply agreement with Contura International A/S (Contura International) to manufacture Bulkamid for us (Manufacturing and Supply Agreement). We have a right to a technology transfer after June 30, 2022 that would enable us to insource the manufacturing of Bulkamid.
Bulkamid received a CE Mark in 2003 and a PMA from the FDA in 2020 and has been sold through a combination of a direct sales force and distributors, which we expect to continue under our ownership. The acquisition of Contura is expected to expand our international operations.
SUI is a common condition that afflicts women of all ages, with childbirth as one of the main contributing factors. SUI is caused by weakness in the pelvic floor, preventing the urethra from closing fully when sudden pressure is put on the bladder. This can allow urine to leak out during normal daily activities such as coughing, laughing, exercising, or lifting an object. SUI is different from overactive bladder. OAB, which is not related to 
pelvic floor weakness, is treated with drugs, Botox or SNM. Many patients present with both SUI and UUI, referred to as mixed incontinence. 
We believe the market for SUI is large and highly underpenetrated, particularly in the United States, with approximately 20 million women suffering from SUI. Similar to urinary incontinence, the majority of women with SUI are suffering in silence. We estimate that approximately 8.8 million women have sought medical treatment, most of whom were offered conservative therapy or opted for no treatment due to a lack of non-invasive treatment options with high efficacy. Similar to SNM, we believe the SUI market is poised for significant and durable growth in the years ahead.
While bulking agents have been on the market for over a decade, the bulking effect of the legacy gels has limitations. This is primarily due to difficulty in administration and the variability in the volume of gel material injected, resulting in middling satisfaction and relief for patients. Legacy bulking agents contain microparticles, which according to clinical literature, sometimes induce a chronic inflammatory response. The combination of these factors has led to modest use of legacy bulking agents and physician preference for an invasive sling procedure to treat women with SUI.
As a next-generation bulking agent, we believe Bulkamid addresses the shortcomings of existing particulate-based bulking agents. It is a unique and patented non-particulate hydrogel that is injected into the urethral wall to restore the natural closing pressure of the urethra. It is a simple, fast, easy-to-learn and perform procedure that is minimally invasive and can be performed in minutes in either a physician’s office or an outpatient facility.
Bulkamid is biocompatible, consisting of 97.5% water, and does not induce a chronic inflammatory response. Bulkamid’s bulking effect is aided due to the fact that the volume, of each injection is predictable, controllable, and precise. Bulkamid retains its bulking characteristics for a number of years, thereby maintaining efficacy and providing women with long lasting relief of their SUI symptoms. Bulkamid is supported by extensive clinical validation, with over 70,000 women treated to date, and generates high rates of patient satisfaction.
We believe we can leverage our expansive commercial footprint and accelerate Bulkamid’s adoption in the United States. As is the case in certain European markets, such as the U.K., we believe Bulkamid will quickly become the gold standard in the U.S. for bulking agents and take share from invasive sling procedures. The new product line further increases our value to physicians as we can now offer customers best-in-class solutions for patients with various types of OAB and SUI.
Bulkamid is currently sold through a direct salesforce in the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Nordic countries and through distributors in over 30 international markets around the world. In the United States, there are currently only five sales professionals.
The acquisition of Bulkamid is expected to be accretive to revenue growth, gross margins and operating margins in 2021 and beyond.
Our Success Factors
We believe that continued growth of our company will be driven by the following success factors: 
•Large and growing SNM market with established coverage and reimbursement. SNM treatment for OAB, FI, and UR is a well-established therapy. Since the first FDA-approved SNM device, the InterStim I System, was introduced in 1997, we estimate hundreds of thousands of patients have been implanted worldwide with such system and its successor InterStim II. In 2018, we believe that approximately 45,000 patients were implanted with SNM therapy, including an estimated 10,000 patients receiving replacement implants, corresponding to an approximately $650 million to $700 million global annual addressable SNM market. We estimate the global SNM market is approximately one to three percent penetrated, and we believe that the introduction of highly differentiated SNM solutions has the potential to grow the market in excess of historical size and growth rates. In addition, because SNM therapy has been widely used in patients for over 20 years in the United States, which we believe makes up nearly 90% of the sales in the global SNM market, reimbursement codes and payments are well-established, and the procedure is covered by most major U.S. insurers.
•Long-term solution offering material benefits to patients, physicians, and payors. Our r-SNM System was the first system for SNM therapy with a rechargeable INS battery that is designed to last approximately 15 years. As a result, our r-SNM System offers several benefits not found in the legacy competitive device, the InterStim II. First, patients implanted with our r-SNM System do not need to undergo replacement surgery every three to five years, as is the case for patients implanted with InterStim II, a non-rechargeable system. We believe a rechargeable system significantly improves a patient’s experience and reduce the risks of surgery and associated infections. In addition, by reducing the number of replacement surgeries, physicians and facilities can utilize their resources more efficiently. We believe that our technology has the potential to significantly reduce overall costs to the healthcare system. In 2016, we commissioned a study, which concluded that a rechargeable SNM system with a 15-year battery life could potentially reduce overall U.S. healthcare costs by up to $12 billion over a 15-year horizon. Our r-SNM System was also the first SNM system to allow full-body MRI scans under certain conditions.
•Significant competitive and functional advantages over other approved SNM devices. We believe that our r-SNM System’s innovative and proprietary design offers significant competitive and functional advantages over InterStim II and Interstim Micro. We believe that our r-SNM System was the first system for SNM therapy with a rechargeable INS battery that is designed to last approximately 15 years, as compared to three to five years for patients implanted with InterStim II. Our proprietary method of combining ceramic and titanium to fabricate the INS enclosure enables us to incorporate a significantly smaller recharging coil into our INS, which offers benefits such as 60% smaller size and half the weight of InterStim II, enhanced communication range with the patient programmer, and twice the recharging interval compared to Interstim Micro. In addition, our r-SNM System employs constant current which automatically adjusts stimulation based on changes to impedance that occur as the implanted lead scars into the body, which we expect will provide a more consistent and reliable therapy over time and reduce patient and physician management of the therapy. Further, our r-SNM System is differentiated by significant wireless charging benefits and an easy-to-use patient remote control. Finally, we designed and custom built a clinician programmer that guides the implanting physician through electrode placement and stimulation programming.
•Strong clinical data. We have a body of compelling clinical evidence that demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of our r-SNM System. In our clinical work to date, we have implanted 180 patients in the United States and Europe. Our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study evaluated 129 patients with UUI. In the two-year results, therapy response rate was 88% of all patients initially treated. Our European study, RELAX-OAB, evaluated 51 patients that suffered from UUF and UUI. The therapeutic response rate at 12 months for the 43 patients who continued with study follow-up was 94% for test responders and 72% for all implanted patients. We intend to follow patients for at least two years for both of our clinical studies. We believe clinical data is important and will be key to driving broad-based adoption of our r-SNM System.
•Substantial sales and clinical field teams. We hire and train sales representatives and clinical specialists with strong backgrounds and experience in SNM therapy and other neurostimulation applications, and who have existing relationships with urologists and urogynecologists. We anticipate that this investment in our sales force will enable us to compete effectively and gain market share, as we expect relationships, expertise and patient outcomes will be important factors in the widespread adoption of our r-SNM System. 
•A deep understanding of our target market. We formed our company by assembling an experienced team with significant in-depth knowledge of our target market. From the outset, we spent significant time understanding the unmet needs of patients and physicians through patient field studies and early engagement of physicians and key opinion leaders. By utilizing this market knowledge and initially focusing solely on SNM, we have been able to navigate the development and regulatory requirements for our r-SNM System in an efficient manner.
•Comprehensive and broad intellectual property portfolio. Our r-SNM System is supported by a nucleus of issued patents and patent applications that we license from the Alfred E. Mann Foundation for Scientific Research (AMF) pursuant to the License Agreement. In addition to that nucleus, we have created a substantial portfolio of wholly owned intellectual property, which includes patents, know-how and trade secrets that are embodied by our r-SNM System. As of December 31, 2020, we own 32 issued U.S. patents and 89 issued foreign patents, and 19 pending U.S. patent applications and 41 pending foreign patent 
applications. We also license from AMF 30 issued U.S. patents and three pending U.S. patent applications, as well as 65 issued foreign patents and 10 pending foreign patent applications. Issued patents owned or used by us will expire between 2021 and 2040.
•Large and underpenetrated SUI market. SUI is a common condition that affects approximately 20 million women. Approximately 16% of adult women suffer from SUI at some point in their lives. It affects women of all ages but becomes more prevalent with age. It can have a significant impact on daily life, affecting activities, relationships, and emotional well-being. Many women are not aware of bulking agents and we see the SUI market as poised for significant and durable growth in the years ahead. We believe that legacy bulking agents have not achieved widespread adoption due to limited efficacy. Legacy gels contain particulate matter and achieve their bulking effect through an inflammatory response in the patient’s body. In addition, we believe urethral sling procedures will become less common in treating SUI due to their invasive nature and the potential for adverse events.
•Substantial opportunity to capture market share with Bulkamid. We believe Bulkamid is a next-generation technology that has distinct advantages over legacy bulking agents and urethral sling procedures. Bulkamid is a non-particulate, biocompatible hydrogel whose bulking effect is linked to the volume of gel injected into the urethral wall, as opposed to competitive bulking agents that achieve bulking through their microparticles and the body’s inflammatory reaction to the particles. We believe we can increase sales of Bulkamid by raising patient awareness and highlighting its excellent clinical results. With Bulkamid, we can now offer customers best-in-class solutions for both OAB and SUI. Bulkamid procedures are done by the same physicians that perform SNM procedures and we expect to leverage our existing relationships to drive adoption of Bulkamid.
•Experienced management team. Our senior management team has over 140 years of combined experience in the medical technology industry. They have a track record of successfully bringing products to market, with significant expertise in development, regulatory approval and commercialization activities. 
Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a global leader in providing effective and long-term solutions to treat urinary and fecal incontinence. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following strategies:
•Continue to promote awareness of our r-SNM System among healthcare providers. We believe that of the approximately 47,000 physicians addressing OAB and FI in the United States, only approximately 2,000 are trained to perform, or are actively performing, SNM procedures. In the near-term, we plan to focus on converting physicians who represent a majority of the implant volume in the United States to switch to our r-SNM System. We intend to help physicians in their direct-to-patient outreach and are pursuing our own direct-to-patient marketing initiatives. We believe this will expand the number of patients undergoing SNM procedures.
•Continue to develop a commercialization infrastructure with a dedicated direct sales team. We intend to focus the significant majority of our sales and marketing efforts in the United States since we believe that nearly 90% of the annual global SNM sales are generated in this market. Our priority is to target high-volume implant centers. To achieve our commercialization goals, we plan to continue to hire and train sales representatives and clinical specialists, and to provide them with sufficient resources to achieve success.
•Continuously innovate to introduce enhanced SNM product offerings and pursue expanded indications. We intend to continue to invest in research and development activities focused on improvements and enhancements to our r-SNM System. Our goals also include expanding the suite of product solutions available for SNM therapy, including a non-rechargeable SNM device that utilizes a primary cell battery.
•Further penetrate our initial target market by promoting patient and practice awareness. Currently, we estimate that approximately one percent of the four million OAB and FI patients that make up the annual global addressable SNM market are implanted with an SNM device. We believe that there are several factors that influence this light penetration of the market. First, although patients may be familiar with SNM as an alternative therapy, patients who elect not to have the procedure do so because of the limitations of the technology in place when we entered the market, such as the potential for multiple INS replacement 
surgeries and the large device size. Second, we believe there is a large potential patient population that suffers from OAB and/or FI and is unaware of third-line therapies such as SNM. We believe that a very low percentage of physician specialists that treat patients with symptoms of OAB and/or FI are actively performing SNM procedures. We intend to educate physicians that are unfamiliar with or do not utilize SNM therapy on the benefits on SNM therapy and the advantages of our r-SNM System. We also intend to increase physician and patient awareness through physician engagement, direct patient outreach, and continued publication of scientific data in peer reviewed journals.
•Expand our product offerings with complementary products in our market. We believe our acquisition of Bulkamid is highly synergistic and positions us to become a global leader in urinary incontinence solutions. We expect to leverage our existing commercial footprint of over 220 sales and clinical specialists in the U.S. and Europe who call on urogynecologists and urologists for SNM, the same physicians who treat SUI. We also believe that extending our urology platform to offer solutions for both OAB and SUI will enhance our value proposition and drive additional SNM sales. Bulkamid is a unique, clinically differentiated bulking agent that we believe addresses the shortcomings of existing particulate-based bulking agents while also offering an alternative to patients who desire to avoid sling surgery and instead opt for a minimally invasive solution. Bulkamid has generated extensive clinical validation and a strong safety profile, with over 70,000 women treated to date.
Our Markets
We believe our initial target market consists of approximately four million adults in the United States and Europe who suffer from symptoms of either bladder or bowel dysfunction, who have already failed first and second line therapies and are readily treatable with, and eligible candidates for, SNM therapy. Specifically, we believe this four million adult market consists of approximately three million adults with symptoms of bladder dysfunction and approximately one million adults with symptoms of bowel dysfunction within these regions. While we anticipate expanding into other geographic regions over time, such as Canada and Australia, we are initially focusing on the United States and Europe due to larger overall market size and greater prevalence of bladder and bowel dysfunction.
The market for SNM therapy is large and growing. We believe that the global SNM market is now approximately $650 million to $700 million, which we believe is comprised of sales of SNM systems for the treatment of UUI, UUF, FI, and UR, and is growing at an approximate rate of 8% year-over-year. We believe this represents approximately 45,000 patient implants, including an estimated 10,000 patients receiving replacement implants, with nearly 90% of sales in this market being generated in the United States and approximately 85% of sales revenue coming from new implant volume. Further, we estimate that the global annual addressable SNM market is presently approximately one to three percent penetrated. We estimate the global annual SNM market will continue to increase for the foreseeable future driven by increased awareness and education of SNM as a therapy alternative, greater expectations for quality of life, and improved patient attitudes toward receiving medical attention. In addition, market growth could accelerate due to more than one medical device company being focused on this market, new innovation for SNM therapy, and other potential products being introduced to physicians and patients. We believe that this represents a compelling opportunity for our r-SNM System to capture market share and further penetrate and grow the existing market.
The market for SUI therapy is large and highly underpenetrated, with approximately 20 million women suffering from SUI in the United States. The majority of women with SUI are suffering in silence. We estimate that approximately only 8.8 million women have sought medical treatment, most of whom were offered conservative therapy or opted for no treatment due to a lack of non-invasive treatment options with high efficacy. Further, we estimate that on an annual basis, there are 25,000 urethral bulking agent treatments and 125,000 pelvic floor sling surgeries performed.
Overview of Overactive Bladder
OAB causes a sudden urge to urinate that may be difficult to stop, and could lead to the involuntary leakage of urine. SNM therapy is a well-established third-line therapy for the treatment of certain patients’ symptoms of OAB, including subtypes UUF and UUI, and UR. Based on phone-based surveys of 5,204 people conducted from November 2000 to January 2001, a study published in 2003 by Stewart WF et al. concluded that of the approximately 244 million adult population in the United States at that time, approximately 40 million, or roughly 16.5%, exhibited symptoms of OAB. Additionally, based on telephone interviews of 19,165 people conducted from April 2005 to December 2005, a study published in 2005 by Milsom et al. concluded that of the estimated 391 million adult population in Europe at that time, approximately 47 million, or roughly 11.8%, exhibited symptoms of OAB.
In the United States and Europe, symptom-specific prevalence varies significantly by gender and age. The graphic below demonstrates OAB prevalence by gender in the United States and Europe.
Although the study and surveys date back approximately twenty years, we believe these surveys are still representative of the prevalence of OAB in the United States and Europe. Obesity and diabetes are frequent risk factors associated with OAB and we believe that the increase in this high-risk population is one of the factors that have driven continued growth in the prevalence of OAB. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), 11 states in 2000 had prevalence of obesity that exceeded 22% and this increased to 36 states that exceeded 26% by 2015. The CDC saw similar conclusions with the increase in diabetes prevalence, where in 2000, approximately half of the states had a prevalence of less than six percent, and by 2015, 27 states had exceeded nine percent.
While historically many people with symptoms of OAB have gone undiagnosed, we believe this is beginning to change. We believe that improved access to care, decreased social acceptance of compromised quality of life, and longer life expectancy may all contribute to individuals being more proactive about acknowledging symptoms of OAB and seeking medical attention. Previously, patients have avoided discussing their symptoms with medical professionals because of misperceptions such as OAB symptoms being a normal and accepted consequence of aging, and lack of availability of treatments, misguided fear of the currently available treatments, and general availability of self-management tools, such as pads. In addition, we believe programs such as the Patient Quality Reporting System (PQRS), which was introduced by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) in 2013, have helped to improve the frequency of dialogue around OAB between physicians and their Medicare patients as it includes incentives and penalties for primary care physicians based on various quality of care metrics, one of which addresses treating UUI symptoms.
The urgency to urinate associated with OAB may be accompanied by a combination of several symptoms, including abnormally frequent urination, or frequency, that is typically defined as urinating eight or more times per day, involuntary leakage of urine, or incontinence, and the disruption of sleep to wake up and pass urine, or nocturia. The combination and severity of OAB symptoms varies from person to person. UUF is characterized by the sudden need to urinate eight or more times per day and, when this symptom is not accompanied by any other symptoms, 
does not include the involuntary leakage of urine. UUI is characterized by the sudden need to urinate accompanied by the involuntary loss of urine, regardless of frequency. Non-obstructive UR is the inability to empty the bladder without an obstruction, such as prostate enlargement or a stricture.
The prevalence of OAB between women and men is generally similar, however, it varies by subtype. Women are more likely to suffer from UUI than UUF, although the difference is not substantial. In contrast, men are much more likely to suffer from UUF than UUI. Incidence by age also varies between men and women, as women often develop UUI at much younger ages than men. UUI symptoms in women ranging in age from 40 to 65 years old are often associated with childbirth or menopause, while prostate enlargement, which is frequently associated with aging, is a leading cause of UUF symptoms in men. These age and gender differences are significant because they may impact who seeks treatment for symptoms of OAB. Individuals with UUI are more likely to seek treatment due to the impact of incontinence on quality of life, and younger individuals are less likely to dismiss symptoms of OAB as an expected and acceptable consequence of aging. As a result, women are more likely to seek treatment for symptoms of OAB than men.
Symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of OAB can develop due to a variety of underlying causes. When a patient consults a physician for the treatment of their symptoms related to OAB, the physician will first undertake a differential diagnosis in an attempt to determine the underlying cause of OAB. Underlying issues that can cause OAB include neurological diseases and injuries, obstructions, bladder abnormalities, and other issues.
If the physician is able to identify an underlying cause of OAB, the physician will then prescribe a care pathway to treat the underlying cause and alleviate the symptoms. When the physician is unable to identify an underlying cause of OAB symptoms, the patient is considered to have idiopathic OAB. We believe that these idiopathic patients are some of the best candidates for SNM therapy and where SNM therapy has been clinically proven to alleviate the symptoms associated with OAB.
In women, the largest group of OAB sufferers are idiopathic, accounting for nearly 50% of the female OAB population. The second largest category is women with mixed urinary incontinence (MUI), which means a patient has both stress urinary incontinence and UUI, accounting for approximately 40% of the female OAB population. While all women with idiopathic OAB can be treated with SNM therapy, based on clinical data, we estimate that approximately 40% of individuals with MUI will be candidates for SNM therapy based on the etiology of their symptoms. Accordingly, we believe that approximately 66% of women who suffer from OAB are treatable with SNM therapy.
In men, the primary causes of OAB symptoms are obstructive, in particular due to the benign enlargement of the prostate. Obstruction-related OAB accounts for over 60% of the male OAB population. Because obstruction-related OAB patients can be treated to address the underlying cause of the obstruction, these men are unlikely to be prescribed OAB medications and are generally not treatable with SNM therapy. Men who are actually diagnosed with idiopathic OAB only account for five percent of the overall population of male OAB sufferers. However, we believe that because of the prevalence of obstructive OAB in men, many men who actually suffer from idiopathic OAB (either alone or in conjunction with obstructive OAB) go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as having solely obstructive OAB. As a result, we believe that the population of men actually diagnosed with idiopathic OAB is comprised of a disproportionate number of men who have been prescribed and failed drugs for the treatment of idiopathic OAB, because there is another segment of men who suffer from idiopathic OAB that is not accounted for in this population. Accordingly, we estimate that approximately 10% of men who suffer from OAB are treatable with SNM therapy.
OAB is associated with a significant economic burden to the society. Direct medical and non-medical costs associated with OAB include the cost of diagnostics, pharmacological care, routine care, and OAB-related consequences such as urinary tract infections, skin infections, and depression. Further, indirect costs of OAB include caregiver wages and worker productivity losses resulting either from disability or absenteeism, as well as intangible costs including the quality-of-life impact and psychological burden. According to a study published in the American Journal of Managed Care in 2009, these OAB costs result in a total economic burden in the United States that is estimated to be between $24.9 billion and $36.5 billion.
Overview of Fecal Incontinence
FI is the inability to control bowel function, causing involuntary or accidental leakage from the rectum. Stimulation of the sacral nerves can reduce incontinence episodes, urgency, and frequency in people suffering from FI, and is an approved therapy for the treatment of FI in the United States and Europe. Moreover, a significant population of people suffering from FI also exhibit symptoms of OAB. SNM therapy can alleviate symptoms in patients suffering from either or both OAB and FI. We believe approximately 60% of people with FI exhibit idiopathic symptoms or experience FI as result of obstetric or surgical injury or other prior trauma, all of which can be treated with SNM therapy.
People with FI experience even greater degrees of embarrassment and decreased quality of life than people with OAB. The total FI population is estimated to be 40 million adults in the United States and Europe. We believe shifting expectations and attitudes toward medical attention suggest this addressable market has the potential to expand.
According to the American National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey program of 2005 through 2006, approximately 8.3% of the adult population in the United States exhibited symptoms of FI. Based on the estimate of the United States population in 2014 of approximately 221 million adults, approximately 18 million adults in the United States exhibited symptoms of FI. In this survey, FI prevalence was assessed as the occurrence of at least one incontinence episode during the past month. Weekly episodes were estimated to occur in 2.7% of the population, and daily episodes in 0.9%. In addition, according to The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom, of the approximately 391 million adult population in Europe in 2007, between 1.0% and 10.0% exhibited symptoms of FI. Based on this data, we have assumed that 5.0% of the adult population in Europe at that time, or approximately 20 million people, exhibited symptoms of FI.
Symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of FI can develop due to a variety of underlying causes. When a patient consults a physician for the treatment of their symptoms related to FI, the physician will first undertake a differential diagnosis in an attempt to determine the underlying cause of FI. Underlying issues that can cause FI include obstetric injury, inflammatory diseases, prior surgeries, and other issues.
If the physician is able to determine that FI is caused by a clear, underlying disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease, the physician will then prescribe a care pathway to treat the underlying disease and alleviate the symptoms. Patients with FI caused by past trauma, mainly from obstetric damage, represent the majority of candidates for treatment of FI with SNM therapy. Additionally, in the absence of an identified underlying cause of FI symptoms, the patient is considered to have idiopathic FI. These idiopathic patients, who make up 10% of women suffering from FI and 7% of men suffering from FI, are also ideal candidates for SNM therapy.
Overview of Stress Urinary Incontinence
SUI is a common condition that afflicts women of all ages, with childbirth as one of the main contributing factors. SUI is caused by weakness in the pelvic floor, preventing the urethra from closing fully when sudden pressure is put on the bladder. This can allow urine to leak out during normal daily activities such as coughing, laughing, exercising, or lifting an object. The first-line treatment options for SUI begin with lifestyle changes and continence pessaries. SUI lacks pharmacologic treatments, with patients next advancing to urethral bulking agents, pelvic floor sling surgery or colpsosuspension.
Path to Treatment
    Overactive Bladder
In the United States, of the approximately 40 million adult patients with symptoms of OAB, we believe that approximately 15.9 million seek medical attention, with UUI patients more frequently consulting with a physician. Similarly, in Europe, of the approximately 47 million adult patients with symptoms of OAB, we believe that approximately 18.7 million seek medical attention. As a result, we believe that the OAB population in the United States and Europe who seek medical attention for OAB, which we refer to as the managed population in the graphic below, is approximately 34.6 million.
Of the approximately 15.9 million patients who seek medical attention in the United States for the treatment of symptoms of OAB, we believe that approximately 6.8 million are addressable with SNM therapy. Similarly, in 
Europe, of the approximately 18.7 million patients who seek medical attention for the treatment of symptoms of OAB, we believe that approximately 8.3 million are addressable with SNM therapy. These amounts are based on our estimates that approximately 66% of women who suffer from OAB have either idiopathic OAB or MUI treatable with SNM therapy, and 10% of men who suffer from OAB have idiopathic OAB. As a result, we believe that the addressable OAB population for SNM therapy is 15.1 million patients in the United States and Europe.
Before treating patients with a third-line therapy such as SNM, physicians are required to prescribe first- and second-line therapies. As discussed further below, first-line therapies include behavioral changes such as diet and exercise, and second-line therapies include drug therapy. In the United States, in order to secure reimbursement, physicians are required to prescribe, and the patient must fail, or be contraindicated and/or refractory for, up to two second-line drug therapies before beginning SNM therapy, although the course of treatment and its duration may vary patient-by-patient based on physician judgment.
Of the approximately 6.8 million patients who exhibit symptoms of OAB that are addressable with SNM therapy in the United States, we estimate that approximately 1.4 million are eligible candidates for SNM therapy. Similarly, of the approximately 8.3 million patients who exhibit symptoms of OAB that are addressable with SNM therapy in Europe, we estimate that approximately 1.6 million are eligible candidates for SNM therapy. These estimates are based on seven percent of these approximately 6.8 million patients who exhibit symptoms of OAB that are addressable with SNM therapy who are currently receiving second-line drug therapies but are not satisfied with the results and are seeking alternative treatment options, and 13% of these approximately 6.8 million patients who exhibit symptoms of OAB that are addressable with SNM therapy who have failed second-line drug therapies and are seeking alternative treatment options. As a result, we believe that the addressable population that is readily treatable with and eligible candidates for SNM therapy, which we refer to as addressable and refractory in the graphic below, is approximately three million patients in the United States and Europe.
The graphic below provides a summary of the calculation of the SNM addressable and refractory population from the overall population of OAB sufferers in the United States and Europe.
    Fecal Incontinence
In the United States and Europe, based on published results from surveys of patients with FI, of the approximately 40 million adults with symptoms of FI, we believe that approximately five million people seek medical attention, which we refer to as the managed population in the graphic below.
Of the approximately five million people who seek medical attention in the United States and Europe for the treatment of symptoms of FI, we believe that approximately 1.7 million have failed or are dissatisfied with conservative treatment, which we refer to as the refractory population in the graphic below.
Of the approximately 1.7 million refractory population, we believe that approximately one million patients do not suffer from FI as a result of a condition that requires a different treatment path, such as neurological diseases, inflammatory disease and severe anatomical defects, and as such are readily treatable with and eligible candidates for, SNM therapy, which we refer to as addressable and refractory in the graphic below.
The graphic below provides a summary of the calculation of the SNM addressable and refractory population from the overall population of FI sufferers in the United States and Europe.
Current Treatments for OAB and Limitations
Patients with OAB follow a care pathway that transitions them, as necessary, through the progressive series of OAB treatment options. The care pathway directs physicians as to the progression of OAB treatments as follows:
•First-line therapy: behavioral changes, including conservative treatment options such as diet, exercise, timed voiding, pelvic floor exercises, and biofeedback;
•Second-line therapy: drug therapy, including two classes of OAB drugs, anti-muscarinics and beta-3 adrenergic agonists, with patients often trying multiple drugs; and
•Third-line therapy: minimally invasive therapy consisting of SNM, BOTOX injections and PTNS.
First- and second-line therapies comprise the largest segment of the treatment market, and medication and other non-implantable treatments are better known to physicians and hospitals than SNM therapy. According to most U.S. insurance reimbursement programs, patients must try and fail at least two different medications before considering and being eligible for third-line therapies.
    First-Line Therapies
First-line therapies represent conservative treatment options. Physicians may recommend that a patient make behavior modifications, such as drinking less fluid, training the bladder and/or pelvic muscles through Kegel exercises, among others. Such treatment options are limited in both duration and effectiveness.
    Second-Line Therapies
Second-line therapies consist of medications, which comprise the largest segment of the OAB treatment market, estimated at $3.6 billion in 2017. Anticholinergics such as Oxybutynin, Vesicare, Detrol, Oxytrol, Enablex, and Sanctura are the most commonly prescribed medications. However, patients often do not fully comply with their drug prescriptions, due to perceived inefficacy and side effects. Mirabegron is the only available beta-3-adrenergic agonist that targets the bladder muscles and reduces bladder contractions and was approved in 2012 to treat OAB. Physicians may also prescribe Tricyclic antidepressants such as Duloxetine and Imipramine, which are not FDA approved to treat the symptoms of OAB, but have been shown to relax the muscles in the bladder and reduce urgency.
Anti-muscarinic drugs inhibit the activation of muscarinic receptors on the bladder muscle by acetylcholine. Dry mouth is the most bothersome adverse event associated with antimuscarinic drugs and often a reason for treatment discontinuation. Side effects also include blurred vision, photophobia, tachycardia, difficulty in urination, hyperthermia, glaucoma, and mental confusion in the elderly.
Beta3-adrenergic agonists are a relatively new drug for OAB that work by relaxing the bladder muscle in the wall of the bladder by stimulating the beta-3 receptors that are found on the surface of the muscle cells. This relaxation of the bladder muscle helps to increase the capacity of the bladder to hold urine. In turn, this reduces the need to pass urine. The most common adverse events observed with Mirabegron in clinical trials were hypertension, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infection.
    Third-Line Therapies
    Sacral Neuromodulation
Historically, SNM therapy has been the most common form of third-line therapy treatment for OAB. InterStim II was approved to treat the symptoms of OAB by the FDA in 2005, and to treat the symptoms of FI by the FDA in 2011, and its predecessor, InterStim, was approved to treat the symptoms of UUI by the FDA in 1997 and 1999 for UUF, respectively. These systems have been implanted in hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide, with a majority of all implants having taken place in the United States. In 2018, approximately 45,000 patients were implanted with these systems, including an estimated 10,000 patients receiving replacement implants.
    BOTOX Injections
BOTOX injections into the bladder muscle were approved for treatment of symptoms of OAB by the FDA in 2013. BOTOX is injected through a cystoscopic procedure in a clinician’s office or the outpatient surgery setting, and BOTOX treats OAB by blocking the signal from the bladder nerves to the bladder muscle. Key adverse events include recurrent urinary tract infections and self-catheterization due to inability to void. BOTOX injections are typically required every six to 12 months to maintain reduction of OAB symptoms. We believe the frequent need for injections and the adverse event profile are deterrents to initial and long-term preference for BOTOX injections, as evidenced by an approximately 60% rate of cessation of BOTOX injections at three years, according to a retrospective study by Mohee et al. 2012.
    Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation
PTNS involves in-office placement of an acupuncture needle in a patient’s ankle to deliver electrical stimulation to the tibial nerve. Typically, patients undergo a 12-week trial period of weekly 60-minute PTNS sessions to evaluate whether the therapy provides significant symptom reduction. After this period, patients that continue with the therapy typically require monthly treatments to maintain symptom reduction. Adverse events of PTNS are minimal; however, lack of PTNS efficacy and lack of patient compliance result in PTNS generally providing less long-term effectiveness than SNM and BOTOX injection therapies.
Our r-SNM System
We believe that our proprietary r-SNM System provides a minimally invasive, effective, and long-lasting solution for SNM therapy to treat patients with bladder and bowel dysfunction. We have marketing approvals in Europe, Canada, and Australia for all relevant clinical indications. Our initial PMA application for our r-SNM System for the treatment of FI was approved by the FDA on September 6, 2019, and our PMA application for our r-SNM System for the treatment of OAB and UR was approved by the FDA on November 13, 2019. 
Our r-SNM System includes two implantable components and various external components.
    Implantable Components for Patient
•Miniaturized rechargeable INS, which houses the electronics for the device. It is five cubic centimeters and is intended to provide one month of battery life between charges under normal use conditions.
•Tined four-electrode lead, which delivers current-controlled stimulation to the targeted sacral nerve. The tines help anchor the lead in its desired position.
Implantable Neurostimulator
    External Components for Patient
•Wireless charging device, which allows transcutaneous charging of the INS. The charger uses an easy to understand combination of visual, audio and haptic indicators to provide information about the charging status. Further, it has the ability to be held into position by an adhesive fixation device or a reusable and flexible belt, which significantly enhances patient mobility.
•Wireless remote control that communicates with the device at a range of up to approximately three feet, which is a small and easy-to-use device that allows the patient to adjust stimulation intensity levels and turn on or off stimulation. The remote control includes a light-emitting diode light that indicates therapy intensity and the status of remaining battery life of the INS.
The implantable components of our r-SNM System deliver mild electrical pulses to the targeted sacral nerve, most frequently the S3 nerve, in order to correct the dysfunction by restoring normal communication to and from the brain. The sacral nerves, including the S3 nerve, are located in the pelvic area and are responsible for controlling urethral sphincters, the bladder and anal sphincter muscles. The image below illustrates the location of the two implantable components of our r-SNM System, the INS and the four-electrode lead:
Benefits of our r-SNM System
We believe that our innovative and proprietary r-SNM System offers several competitive advantages as compared to the legacy SNM system, InterStim II. Our device was the first SNM System to offer the following important benefits:
•Long-term solution. The battery is designed to last 15 years, compared to 3-5 years for the non-rechargeable Interstim II.
•Material benefits to physicians and payors. We believe our r-SNM System has the potential to enable physicians and facilities to utilize their resources more efficiently and significantly reduce overall costs to the healthcare system, due to the need for less replacement surgeries compared to InterStim II.
•Small and lightweight implantable neurostimulator. Our INS is approximately 60% smaller than and half the weight of InterStim II.
•Constant current. Our r-SNM System delivers constant-current stimulation, which automatically adjusts stimulation based on changes to impedance that occur as the implanted lead scars into the body and we believe provides a more consistent and reliable therapy.
In addition, we believe our r-SNM System offers many additional competitive advantages compared to the InterStim product line, including the InterStim Micro, our competitor’s new rechargeable device:
•Improved patient experience. Our r-SNM System charges wirelessly and includes a discrete, small and easy-to-use remote control. 
•Simplified physician implantation and programming. Our clinician programmer guides the implanting physician through electrode placement and stimulation programming and enables physicians to access key data from the patient’s INS.
•Broad MRI conditions. Our r-SNM System allows for 1.5T and 3T full-body MRI scans under broad conditions. For example, 1.5T full-body MRI scans can be done in normal operating mode with no additional whole-body specific absorption rate limitation.
•Clinically proven results. Our r-SNM System is the only rechargeable SNM System with clinical data to support its safety and efficacy. Two-year results from our clinical study show that 93% of patients achieved clinically significant improvements.
Overview of our External Trial System
Our external trial system (ETS) can be used during an evaluation period by a physician to determine if a patient is a good candidate for SNM therapy. This system includes a disposable external stimulation device, a disposable implantable lead, and a patient remote control. The external stimulation device is comprised of a temporary, non-rechargeable, current controlled pulse generator. The temporary implantable lead has a single electrode. In addition, our ETS can be used for a bilateral percutaneous nerve evaluation trial or a tined lead evaluation trial. In July 2018, we received the CE Mark for our ETS, and in September 2019, we received FDA approval for our ETS.
Overview of our Physician Tools
We provide physicians with a clinician programmer and a surgical tool kit to assist them while implanting our r-SNM System. Our clinician programmer also allows physicians to connect to a patient’s INS, while the patient is in the physician’s care, to access key therapy data that is stored and maintained on the INS.
    Clinician Programmer
We designed and custom built our touchscreen clinician programmer. The INS is programmed by, and wirelessly communicates with the clinician programmer. This programmer is designed to simplify and assist with electrode placement and stimulation programming experience for physicians. It has a series of touchscreens with a graphical user interface that provides information to the physician, such as measured data, test stimulation adjustments, and electrode configurations based on the utilization of proprietary algorithms. Further, it enables the clinician programmer to access any r-SNM INS data and its complete history. The clinician programmer records and stores all data from the INS and enables a physician to store and retrieve this data electronically.
Clinician Programmer
    Surgical Tool Kit
The single-use surgical tool kit provides the physician with the tools necessary for the r-SNM System implant procedure. The tools provided are familiar for physicians experienced in SNM implants and follow the established surgical techniques for the implant.
Treatment with our r-SNM System
Patient Selection
SNM therapy is an approved therapy for patients with symptoms of bladder and bowel dysfunction. This therapy is not intended for patients with a mechanical obstruction such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, a tumor, or urethral stricture. Further, the therapy is not indicated for pregnant women, or pediatric use.
SNM therapy for bowel dysfunction is indicated for patients who are not candidates for more conservative treatments. The therapy is not indicated for pregnant women, or pediatric use.
Implantation
Before receiving our r-SNM System, a patient in the United States typically undergoes an external trial period.
    External Trial Period
The short external trial procedure, which typically lasts approximately 30 minutes, is generally performed in the office or outpatient setting and typically involves a percutaneously placed lead, which a physician implants near the targeted sacral nerve using a needle, with the location confirmed utilizing fluoroscopy and intraoperative muscle responses evoked by test stimulation. The lead is then connected to a temporary, disposable external trial system which provides stimulation for the therapy. The trial period can last between a few days and several weeks after which the physician evaluates the effectiveness of SNM therapy through several measures, including bladder or bowel episodes and patient satisfaction. Approximately 60-90% of patients proceed from trial stimulation to permanent implant depending on the trial type and patient selection.
    Permanent Implant
Patients who have undergone a successful external trial period are eligible for a permanent INS implant procedure. The permanent implant procedure typically occurs in an ambulatory surgical center or hospital outpatient setting, usually lasting under an hour, and includes implantation of the INS and, if a temporary lead was used for the trial, implantation of the permanent lead. The INS is inserted through a small incision into a pocket in the subcutaneous fat of the upper buttocks, and the lead body is tunneled to the INS pocket and connected to the INS.
Activation and Programming
Following the implant procedure or within a week thereafter, the patient has their stimulation programmed. Stimulation settings are adjusted to ensure they are comfortable to the patient. Reprogramming sessions may be necessary to achieve and maintain symptom reduction or to address discomfort. After initial programming, a patient has the ability to modify the therapy with the patient remote control.
Our Clinical Results and Studies with our r-SNM System
We have a body of compelling clinical evidence that demonstrates the safety, effectiveness, and sustained benefits of our r-SNM System. We have two clinical studies relating to our r-SNM System, a European study, RELAX-OAB, and a U.S. pivotal study, ARTISAN-SNM.
In June 2018, we completed the enrollment and implantation of 129 patients with UUI for our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study. As of August 2020, all patients in our ARTISAN-SNM study reached the two-year post-implant follow-up, resulting in completion of the ARTISAN-SNM study. These patients were evaluated at 14 centers in the United States and five centers in Europe.
    Key highlights of our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study at two-years are as follows: 
•113 of the 121 implanted patients completing the two-year visit, or 93%, were therapy responders. Of the 129 patients initially treated, 88% were therapy responders at two years (113 out of 129); 
•93 of the 113 therapy responses, or 82%, had a ≥75% reduction in urgency incontinence episodes; and 
•94% of patients reported being “satisfied” with the therapy; and
•No serious device-related adverse events have been reported.
Our European RELAX-OAB study that began in June 2016 evaluated 51 patients at seven sites in Europe that suffered from OAB subtypes UUI and/or UUF. The 12-month results were published in the peer reviewed Journal of Neurourology and Urodynamics in January 2019. All patients were evaluated to determine if they were therapy responders, which was defined as showing at least a 50% reduction in the number of average leaks or voids per day or a reduction to less than eight voids per day, in each case on a three-day bladder diary, at various times post-implant. We are following patients out to two years in this study and may follow patients out to five years at selected study sites.
    Key highlights of our European RELAX-OAB study are as follows: 
•The study has completed one-year follow-ups and two-year follow-ups;
•Therapy responder rate at 12 months for the 43 patients who continued with study follow-up was 94% for test responders and 72% for all implanted patients; 
•At 12 months, 84% of test responders and 77% of all implanted patients were “very” or “moderately” satisfied with the therapy provided by our r-SNM System; and 
•No serious device-related adverse events have been reported. 
To date, we have observed no unanticipated adverse events (AEs) or serious device-related AEs, in any of our clinical studies or the case series. Further, the safety and effectiveness of SNM therapy when compared to anticholinergic medications was also supported by the InSite study, a prospective, randomized, multi-center study, published on January 10, 2014 in the Journal of Neurourology and Urodynamics. This study was sponsored by Medtronic and began in 2007 and ended in 2016, after the last patient reached the five-year endpoint.
Our Bulkamid Product
Bulkamid is a urethral bulking agent in the form of a non-particulate hydrogel, consisting of 97.5% water and 2.5% polyacrylamide. Bulkamid is injected into the soft tissue of the urethra, adding volume to narrow the lumen of the urethra and to support the closing mechanism of the urethra, thus preventing urine leakage. Urethral bulking does not close the urethra totally; the urethra still opens normally to allow for urination.
Bulkamid achieves its bulking effect by the volume of the gel injected, unlike competitive bulking agents that achieve bulking effect through their micro particles and the body’s inflammatory reaction to the particles.
The Bulkamid procedure is minimally invasive, with no cuts or incisions necessary, and typically takes around 10 to 15 minutes. It usually is performed in an outpatient facility or day surgery unit under a local anesthetic and the patient is able to return home the same day. The injections are made into 3 to 4 locations in the urethral wall; the total volume injected is 1.5 to 2 mL, equivalent to slightly less than half a teaspoon. It is a simple procedure that is easy for physicians to learn.
The majority of women treated with Bulkamid report dryness or improvement in their symptoms, with many seeing that improvement as soon as they leave the doctor’s office, hospital or clinic. Whilst experiencing no leakage at all is the most desired outcome of treatment, many women consider a successful treatment to be a meaningful decrease in the amount and frequency of urine leakage due to stress urinary incontinence such that they are able to go about most of their daily activities. If relief from symptoms is not sufficient, an additional injection of Bulkamid (a “top-up” injection) can be given to help achieve desired results. 
Patients who undergo Bulkamid treatment are likely to be free from unwanted urinary leakage or at least have significantly fewer episodes of urinary leakage. In Bulkamid clinical studies, women were asked how effective their treatment was 12 months after their initial injection. Over three quarters of women reported that their incontinence was either cured or improved and approximately two-thirds of women were dry. Bulkamid clinical studies have also shown that most of the women treated over 7 years ago still report benefit.
Over 70,000 women with stress urinary incontinence have been treated with Bulkamid across 25 countries over the last 15 years. During that time, a low number of complications or adverse events have been reported and there have been no reported long-term complications.
Sales and Marketing
We are primarily focused on commercializing our products in the United States, which accounts for the vast majority of SNM sales worldwide. We have established a significant commercial infrastructure, with over 220 sales personnel and clinical specialists and we continue to make significant investments to build our commercial organization to market and support our products. When making hiring decisions for these roles, we prioritize individuals with strong sales backgrounds and experience in SNM therapy and other neurostimulation applications, and who also have existing relationships with urologists and urogynecologists. We expect to focus the significant majority of our sales and marketing efforts in the United States where reimbursement for SNM therapy is well established and covered by most major U.S. insurers, including Medicare. 
Through our specialized and dedicated direct sales organization, we are targeting the approximately 2,000 urologists, urogynecologists and colorectal surgeons who are trained and have experience performing SNM procedures. Our particular focus is on the estimated top 1,000 implanting centers that represent a majority of the implant volume in the United States. We estimate that approximately 80% of U.S. implant volume is generated by these 1,000 implanting centers.
In order to support our direct sales team, we have approximately 90 clinical support staff as of December 31, 2020. This clinical staff is primarily responsible for attending implant procedures and assisting the implanting physician with programming the device. Based on our clinical experience to date, we believe that physicians experienced in SNM therapy require minimal training to start implanting our r-SNM System.
We are promoting broader awareness of SNM therapy for the treatment of OAB among patients and physicians, as well as awareness of the benefits and advantages of our r-SNM System. We plan to expand our awareness raising activities, including publication of scientific data in peer reviewed journals and education of physicians who are not familiar with or do not utilize SNM therapy. We may also engage in broad marketing initiatives in jurisdictions where we are permitted to do so.
Our main commercial priority is the United States where we began commercializing and marketing our r-SNM System and generate revenue from product sales. In November 2018, we launched a limited commercial effort in Europe, where we currently have five dedicated sales representatives. We do expect to expend capital resources pursuing commercial operations in Europe, Canada and Australia, where we have marketing approvals for OAB, FI, UR and SUI, but the amount and timing of which will depend on a variety of factors, including the size of the developed market for SNM therapy and bulking agents, burdens to entry and other region- and country-specific factors.
The acquisition of Contura leverages our existing commercial footprint of over 220 sales and clinical specialists in the U.S. and Europe that call on urogynecologists and urologists. Bulkamid is currently sold through a direct salesforce in the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Nordic countries and in addition, through distributors in over 30 international markets around the world. In the United States, there are currently five sales professionals.
Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States, we derive revenue from the sale of our products to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers, which typically bill various third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other healthcare-related organizations. In addition, we expect that any portion of the costs and fees associated with our r-SNM System that are not covered by these third-party payors, such as deductibles or co-payments, will be billed directly to the patient by the provider. Third-party payors require physicians and hospitals to identify the product and service for which they are seeking reimbursement by using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, which are created and maintained by the American Medical Association (AMA). As SNM therapy has been widely used in patients for over 20 years in the United States, reimbursement codes and payments are well-established and the procedure is covered by Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans. Similarly for urethral bulking agent treatments, reimbursement codes and payments are well-established and the procedure is covered by Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans.
Physician reimbursement under Medicare is generally based on a defined fee schedule (the Physician Fee Schedule), through which payment amounts are determined by the relative value of the service rendered by the physician. Medicare generally provides reimbursement to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers for SNM therapy under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system and the Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment 
System, respectively, which reimburse to the hospital or ambulatory surgical center, as applicable, a bundled amount generally intended to cover all facility costs related to procedures performed in the outpatient setting. The typical Medicare payment for facility and physician services for an SNM trial and full system implant ranges from approximately $22,000 to approximately $27,400, which covers the cost for the devices and the implantation procedures.
Our r-SNM System and the associated procedures are eligible for payment under the existing CPT codes typically used for SNM therapy, including CPT 64581 for transforaminal implantation of a lead near the sacral nerve and CPT 64590 for insertion or replacement of a peripheral or gastric neurostimulator, which includes a neurostimulator for SNM therapy. Reimbursement rates vary based on several factors, including but not limited to the payor, geographic location, the procedure performed, contract terms, the facility in which the procedure is performed and other factors.
Most large insurers have established coverage policies in place to cover SNM therapy. Certain commercial payors have a patient-by-patient prior authorization process that must be followed before they will provide reimbursement for SNM therapy. These processes typically involve the treating physician submitting a form to the payor that provides information about the past treatments provided to the patient that proved ineffective, and the physician’s recommendation that the patient be treated with SNM therapy. Although the prior authorization process can take several weeks, based on our industry knowledge, it generally results in positive coverage determination for these patients.
Outside the United States, reimbursement levels vary significantly by country and by region, particularly based on whether the country or region at issue maintains a single-payor system. SNM therapy is eligible for reimbursement in Canada, Australia and certain countries in Europe. Annual healthcare budgets generally determine the number of SNM systems that will be paid for by the payor in these single-payor system countries and regions. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both. Some countries or regions may require us to gather additional clinical data before granting coverage and reimbursement for our r-SNM System.
Research and Development
We intend to continue to invest in research and development activities focused on improvements and enhancements to our r-SNM System to improve patient outcomes and further expand patient access to our r-SNM therapy. Research and development expenses were approximately $29.2 million, $20.2 million, and $19.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Our goals include expanding the suite of product solutions available for SNM therapy, including a non-rechargeable SNM device that utilizes a primary cell battery.
Manufacturing and Supply
We currently outsource the manufacture of the implantable components of our r-SNM System. We plan to continue with an outsourced manufacturing arrangement for the foreseeable future. Our contract manufacturers are all recognized in their field for their competency to manufacture the respective portions of our r-SNM System and have quality systems established that meet FDA requirements. We believe the manufacturers we currently utilize have sufficient capacity to meet our launch requirements and are able to scale up their capacity relatively quickly with limited capital investment. 
We employ a rigorous supplier assessment, qualification, and selection process targeted to suppliers that meet the requirements of the FDA and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures. Our quality assurance process monitors and maintains supplier performance through qualification and periodic supplier reviews and audits. We are required to maintain ISO 13485 certification for medical devices sold in the European Economic Area (EEA), which requires, among other items, an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations.
We inspect, test, and assemble our r-SNM System under strict manufacturing processes supported by internal policies and procedures. We perform our own final quality control testing of each r-SNM System. However, we do not have complete control over all aspects of the manufacturing process of, and are dependent on, our contract 
manufacturing partners for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations applicable to our r-SNM System.
Our suppliers are managed through our supplier management program that is focused on reducing supply chain risk. Key aspects of this program include managing component inventory at the supplier, contractual requirements for last time buy opportunities and second sourcing approaches for specific suppliers. Typically, our outside vendors produce the components to our specifications and in many instances to our designs. Our suppliers are audited periodically by our quality department to ensure conformity with the specifications, policies and procedures for our devices. In addition, we and our suppliers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by U.S. and international regulatory authorities to ensure compliance with quality regulations. We believe that, if necessary, alternative sources of supply would be available in a relatively short period of time and on commercially reasonable terms.
For our off-the-shelf components, we do not have long-term supply agreements with many of our third-party manufacturers, and we purchase certain components of our r-SNM System on a purchase order basis. We may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply of certain components of our r-SNM System. If our current third-party manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace those manufacturers. Although we believe that there are several potential alternative manufacturers who could manufacture these components, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement. We believe our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet global market demand for our r-SNM System for the foreseeable future.
As previously discussed, and pursuant to the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, Contura International manufactures all of the Bulkamid that we sell. We have rights to a technology transfer after June 30, 2022 that would enable us to insource the manufacturing of Bulkamid. Under the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, Contura International is responsible for obtaining and maintaining all necessary permits, licenses, approvals and authorizations required for the manufacture and sale of Bulkamid. The Manufacturing and Supply Agreement is subject to certain maximum purchase amounts of Bulkamid, which we believe are sufficient to meet the projected global demand for Bulkamid.
Competition
We believe our products are designed to offer several needed improvements for patients, physicians, and payors. However, the medical technology industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.
We consider our primary competition to be implantable SNM devices offered by Medtronic. Medtronic’s InterStim II and Interstim Micro are currently the only other implantable SNM devices approved for commercial sale in the United States by the FDA. We also compete with other third-line treatments, such as BOTOX injections, a product sold by Allergan plc, PTNS, as well as more invasive surgical treatment options, and drugs for the treatment of OAB and FI. We also face competition from Boston Scientific for the treatment of SUI with its own competitive hydrogel. In addition, emerging businesses may be in the early stages of developing additional products or therapies designed to treat OAB, FI or SUI.
We face competition from major medical device companies worldwide, many of which have longer, more established operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, distribution, and other resources. Our overall competitive position is dependent upon a number of factors, including:
•company, product and brand recognition;
•history of product use and physician familiarity with products and treatments;
•regulatory approvals and approved indications;
•product safety, reliability and durability;
•INS size, rechargeability and battery life;
•full-body MRI scan safety;
•quality and volume of clinical data;
•effective marketing to and education of patients, physicians and hospitals;
•product ease of use and patient comfort;
•physician implantation and programming process;
•sales force experience and market access;
•product support and service;
•technological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation;
•pricing and revenue strategies;
•procedure costs to patients and the overall healthcare system; and
•dedicated practice development.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. 
We own numerous issued patents and pending patent applications that relate to our r-SNM System and several issued patents and patent applications were licensed from AMF in 2013 pursuant to the License Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we own 32 issued U.S. patents and 89 issued foreign patents, and 19 pending U.S. patent applications and 41 pending foreign patent applications. We also license from AMF 30 issued U.S. patents and three pending U.S. patent applications, as well as 65 issued foreign patents and 10 pending foreign patent applications. Issued patents owned or used by us will expire between 2021 and 2040.
In addition, we own or have rights to trademarks and domains in the United States and select locations internationally that we use in connection with the operation of our business.
We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may in the future rely upon licensing opportunities, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with third party contract manufacturers, suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information that we own or license for use.
AMF License Agreement
On October 1, 2013, we entered into the License Agreement, pursuant to which AMF granted us the AMF IP relating to AMF Licensed Products.
Under the License Agreement, for each calendar year beginning in 2018, we are obligated to pay AMF a royalty on an AMF Licensed Product-by-AMF Licensed Product basis if one of the following conditions applies: (i) one or more valid claims within any of the patents licensed to us by AMF covers such AMF Licensed Products or the manufacture of such AMF Licensed Products or (ii) for a period of 12 years from the first commercial sale anywhere in the world of such AMF Licensed Product, in each case. The foregoing royalty is calculated as the greater of (a) 4% of all net revenue derived from the AMF Licensed Products, and (b) a minimum annual royalty (the Minimum Royalty), payable quarterly. The Minimum Royalty automatically increases each year, subject to a maximum amount of $200,000 per year. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we have recorded royalties of $4.4 million, $0.6 million, and $0.1 million, respectively. We have 60 days to pay AMF the royalty amount due under the License Agreement, and if we fail to pay AMF within such 60-day period, AMF may, at its election, convert the exclusive license to a non-exclusive license or terminate the License Agreement. 
The protection of intellectual property has been and remains a priority for us. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” 
Government Regulation Applicable to Us
Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the United States, including the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Health & Human Services - Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as comparable authorities in the European Economic Area (EEA), Australia, and Canada. These government authorities continue to highly scrutinize our industry. Our products are subject to regulation as a medical device under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
In addition to U.S. regulations, we are subject to a variety of regulations in the EEA, Australia, and Canada governing clinical studies and the commercial sales and distribution of our products. We will be required to obtain authorization under appropriate regulatory authorities in countries outside the United States before commencing clinical studies and to obtain marketing authorization or approval before we can commercialize our product in those countries, whether or not we have or are required to obtain FDA clearance or approval for a product. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or PMA approval.
Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Devices for which there is no predicate device and which therefore are not eligible for 510(k) review but project a low-to-moderate risk may be eligible for the de novo review process.
Our r-SNM System is a Class III device and as such, we obtained PMA approval to market our device for the treatment of OAB, FI and UR.
In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective. The PMA is typically supported by data from preclinical studies and human clinical studies. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a preapproval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with applicable portions of the Quality Systems Regulation (QSR).
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which may affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may require no clinical data or less extensive clinical data than the original PMA or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new supplement or PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
Postmarket Regulation - United States
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment, registration and device listing with the FDA;
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
•the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and various state and foreign laws on reporting remunerative relationships with health care providers;
•the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute (and similar state laws) prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not have to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;
•the U.S. False Claims Act (and similar state laws) prohibiting, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing, or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing, an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government. The government may assert that items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of a cleared device, or approval of a supplement for certain modifications to PMA devices;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, under which the FDA can order device recalls under certain circumstances and that require manufacturers report to the FDA voluntary field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
•complying with the new federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers (UDI), on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID); and
•postmarket surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products or any future product candidates;
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
•withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
•refusal to permit the export or import of our products or future product candidates; or
•criminal prosecution.
In addition, other U.S. federal and state government authorities, including but not limited to the DOJ, HHS-OIG, FCC and CMS, have broad enforcement powers and can impose various sanctions under the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, the U.S. False Claims Act, and various other laws. These sanctions could include but are not limited to fines, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions, and agreements such as Deferred Prosecution Agreements or Corporate Integrity Agreements, under which we may be required to establish additional controls to ensure compliance.
Regulation of Medical Devices in the EEA and the U.K.
Medical devices, other than active implantable medical devices (AIMDs), placed on the market in the EEA (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) must comply with the essential requirements set out in Annex I of the Directive 93/42/EEC (Medical Devices Directive).
Separately, active implantable medical devices are governed by Directive 90/385/EEC, also known as the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive (AIMD Directive). AIMDs are defined as medical devices that rely on a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that generated by the body, which are totally or partially introduced, either surgically or medically, into the human body and intended to remain after the procedure. Our r-SNM System, or our internal product, qualifies as an AIMD and must therefore comply with the AIMD Directive, more specifically with the essential requirements it sets out at Annex I.
An overarching essential requirement proscribed under both the AIMD Directive and the Medical Devices Directive is that any device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured and packaged in a suitable manner.
In addition to the essential requirements set out under both the AIMD and Medical Devices Directives, the European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment, and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements, creating a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies the essential requirements.
Under the AIMD Directive, manufacturers must demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I by undergoing a conformity assessment procedure. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product and postmarket experience in respect of similar products already marketed to ensure and declare that the products in question comply with the standards set out in Annex I of the AIMD Directive. In addition, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body. Notified Bodies are separate entities that are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by the governmental authorities of each EU Member State. Manufacturers of AIMDs must make an application to a Notified Body for an assessment of its technical dossiers and quality system. Alternatively, manufacturers can seek approval from the Notified Body that a representative sample of the products it has manufactured satisfies the requirements set out in the AIMD Directive and subsequently ensure and declare that all of its products conform to the standard of the approved sample. This is also known as “type approval.”
Similar requirements for conformity assessment procedures apply under the Medical Devices Directive, which vary according to the type of medical device and its classification. We believe that our external device is categorized as a Class IIa device under Annex IX of the Medical Devices Directive. As such, the conformity assessment procedure requirements for our external device are identical to those detailed above for our internal product under the AIMD Directive.
If satisfied that the AIMD or other medical device conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the Notified Body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of 
conformity (see above). The manufacturer may then apply the Conformité Européenne (CE) mark to the device, which allows the device to be legally placed on and traded within the market throughout the EEA. Once the product has been placed on the market in the EEA, the manufacturer must comply with requirements for reporting incidents and field safety corrective actions associated with the product.
In order to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for their AIMDs and other medical devices, manufacturers must conduct clinical investigations in accordance with the requirements of Annex X to the Medical Devices Directive and Annex 7 to the AIMD Directive, as well as standards (if any) which may be imposed by national authorities of EEA states in addition to those set out in Annex X to the Medical Devices Directive and Annex 7 to the AIMD Directive (the Directives). Clinical studies for medical devices usually require the approval of an ethics review board and approval by or notification to the national regulatory authorities. Both regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of serious adverse event reports during a study and may request a copy of the final study report.
On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament adopted the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which will repeal and replace both AIMD and Medical Devices Directives. The Medical Devices Regulation is directly applicable in the EEA. This is intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA countries. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.
Starting January 1, 2021, all medical devices sold in the U.K. must meet new regulatory requirements due to the U.K.’s departure from the European Union or “Brexit.” Among other things, companies must register their devices with the U.K. Medicines & Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and may need to change their product marking and labeling. In addition, if the company is not based in the U.K., it must appoint a U.K. Responsible Person to register with the MHRA and assist the company in meeting U.K. regulatory requirements.
United Kingdom’s Vote to Leave the EU (Brexit)
The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to EU markets. Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from EU directives and regulations, the referendum could materially change the regulatory regime applicable to products approved and sold in the United Kingdom. It is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and EU countries, increased regulatory complexities, and economic and political uncertainty in the region. Because of the continued uncertainty about the effects and implementation of Brexit, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of Brexit or related legislation on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
In addition, Brexit will likely affect European and worldwide economic or market conditions, which could lead to instability in global financial markets. Brexit is likely to lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Regulation of Medical Devices in Other Jurisdictions
We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in the EEA countries, Australia, Canada, and other foreign countries in which we may sell our r-SNM System, including in the areas of:
•design, development, manufacturing and testing;
•product standards;
•product safety;
•product safety reporting;
•marketing, sales and distribution;
•packaging and storage requirements;
•labeling requirements;
•content and language of instructions for use;
•clinical studies;
•record keeping procedures;
•advertising and promotion;
•recalls and field corrective actions;
•postmarket surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;
•import and export restrictions;
•tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements;
•registration for reimbursement; and
•necessity of testing performed in country by distributors for licensees.
The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
U.S. Fraud and Abuse and Physician Payment Transparency Laws
Various U.S. federal and state laws restrict our business practices regarding items of value provided to healthcare providers including, without limitation, the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, the U.S. False Claims Act, and the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act.
The U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including cash, in-kind items, meals, travel, lodging, consulting or research agreements, grants, donations, charitable contributions, free equipment or services, royalty arrangements, stock, stock options, and the compensation derived through ownership interests.
Recognizing that the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, the United States Department of Health and Human Services has established various “safe harbors,” that if met in form and substance, will assure medical device manufacturers, healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn and interpreted narrowly. Government authorities may claim that our arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other persons or entities do not fully meet the stringent criteria specified in these safe harbors.
Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, government authorities may argue that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
Violations of the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $102,522 (in 2019) for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. 
Government authorities may contend that we are liable under the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute because of the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business, if we acted with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws that establish similar prohibitions, and in some cases, may apply more broadly.
The U.S. civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The federal civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil federal civil False Claims Act, if a person acts with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard.
In addition, private parties may initiate “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the U.S. civil False Claims Act in the name of the government and share in the proceeds of any recovery. Penalties for U.S. civil False Claim Act violations include fines ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government. More critically, a violation may provide the basis for exclusion from federal healthcare programs. The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the federal criminal False Claims Act. The criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent and, unlike the federal civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. 
Additionally, the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires annual reporting of transfers of value to certain healthcare providers by companies whose products are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurate and complete information under the Sunshine Act may result in civil monetary penalties of $11,052 per failure up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.105 million per year for “knowing failures”). Certain U.S. states similarly require tracking and reporting of certain transfers of value to healthcare providers and some mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs or, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Laws
Our operations outside the United States are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The FCPA generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an official government action. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of “off books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. We also are subject to similar anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws in Europe, Australia, and Canada, and would be subject to such laws in many other countries in which we might choose to do business.
FCC Regulation
Because our r-SNM System includes a wireless radio frequency transmitter and receiver, it is subject to equipment authorization requirements in the United States. The FCC requires advance clearance of all radio frequency devices before they can be imported into, sold or marketed in the United States. These clearances ensure that the proposed products comply with FCC radio frequency emission and power level standards and will not cause interference.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign laws that protect the confidentiality and restrict the use and disclosure of personal information, such as patient health information.
For example, the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), establishes uniform standards governing the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) and requires healthcare providers, called “covered entities”, to maintain certain safeguards to protect the privacy and security of PHI. HIPAA also requires 
business associates (independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of a covered entity) to enter into business associate agreements with the covered entity. These agreements require the business associate to safeguard the covered entity’s PHI against improper use and disclosure.
Failure to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security standards can result in civil monetary penalties up to $55,910 per violation, not to exceed $1.68 million per calendar year for non-compliance of an identical provision, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment.
HIPAA authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents for violations. Courts can award damages, costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to file suit against us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care cases in state civil suits alleging negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. In addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security standards.
In the EU, we may be subject to various laws relating to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e. data relating to an identifiable individual). We may process personal data of our employees, our customers, and our vendors. These laws include the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (GDPR), the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC and national laws supporting aspects of the GDPR and implementing the E-Privacy Directive. Each EU Member State has transposed the requirements laid down by the E-Privacy Directive into its own national data privacy regime, while the GDPR permits EU Member States to implement local legislation to supplement the GDPR, and therefore the laws may differ by jurisdiction, sometimes significantly. We need to ensure compliance with the rules in each jurisdiction where we are established or are otherwise subject to local privacy laws.
The GDPR became applicable on May 25, 2018, replacing the previous data protection laws issued by each EU member state under the Directive 95/46/EC. Unlike the Directive, the GDPR is directly applicable in each EU Member State, resulting in a more uniform application of data privacy laws across the EU. Like the previous Directive, the GDPR requires that personal data may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes based on legal bases for processing set out in the GDPR and local laws, and may only be processed in a manner consistent with those purposes. Personal data must be secure, not be transferred outside of the EEA unless certain steps are taken to ensure an adequate level of protection and must not be kept for longer than necessary for the purposes of collection. In addition, the GDPR also limits the circumstances and the manner in which we are legally permitted to process that data and transfer that data outside of the EEA. In particular, in order to process such data, explicit consent to the processing (including any transfer) is usually required from the data subject (being the person to whom the personal data relates). 
The GDPR also imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing. It requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) how their personal information is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of information, increases requirements pertaining to pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. Fines for non-compliance with the GDPR are significant—€20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.
We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to applicable law.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our r-SNM System or any future product candidates profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our r-SNM System or future product candidates. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our r-SNM System or future product candidates.
The implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially. The Affordable Care Act provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act has expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. We do not yet know the full impact that the Affordable Care Act will have on our business. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect additional challenges and amendments in the future. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance.
We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our r-SNM System or future product candidates or additional pricing pressure.
Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our sales in 2020, by significantly decreasing and delaying the number of procedures performed using our r-SNM System, and we expect that the pandemic could continue to negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similar to the general trend in elective and other surgical procedures, the number of procedures performed using our r-SNM System decreased significantly as healthcare organizations in the United States and globally, including in Europe and Canada, have prioritized the treatment of patients with COVID-19 or have altered their operations to prepare for and respond to the pandemic. Specifically, substantially all of the procedures using our r-SNM System were postponed or cancelled from middle of March 2020 through May 2020, but order flow began a gradual recovery in May 2020 and continued to improve in the second half of 2020.
To protect the health of our employees, their families, and our communities, we have restricted access to our offices to personnel who must perform critical activities that must be completed on-site, limited the number of such personnel that can be present at our facilities at any one time, requested that many of our employees work remotely, and implemented travel restrictions. These restrictions and precautionary measures have not adversely affected our operations. The full extent of COVID-19’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, and additional protective measures implemented by the governmental authorities, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape. However, if the pandemic continues to evolve into a long-term severe worldwide health crisis, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had 416 employees. Of this total, 9 were employees based outside of the U.S. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our manufacturing, product development, warehouse and administrative employees are generally located in the same or adjacent facilities, which we believe contributes to our culture of strong manufacturing, engineering and customer service capabilities.
