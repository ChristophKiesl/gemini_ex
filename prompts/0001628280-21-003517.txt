Item 1.    Business
Biglari Holdings Inc. is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities, including property and casualty insurance, media and licensing, restaurants, and oil and gas. The Company’s largest operating subsidiaries are involved in the franchising and operating of restaurants. Biglari Holdings is founded and led by Sardar Biglari, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Company’s long-term objective is to maximize per-share intrinsic value. All major investment and capital allocation decisions are made for the Company and its subsidiaries by Mr. Biglari.
As of December 31, 2020, Mr. Biglari’s beneficial ownership was approximately 67.2% of the Company’s outstanding Class A common stock and 60.6% of the Company’s outstanding Class B common stock.
Overview of the Impact of COVID-19
The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”), declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, caused governments to impose restrictive measures to contain its spread. Those shutdowns significantly affected our operating businesses to varying degrees. The risks and uncertainties resulting from the pandemic may continue to affect our future earnings, cash flows, and financial condition. Accordingly, estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with the evaluation of certain long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets for impairment, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods.
Restaurant Operations
The Company’s restaurant operations are conducted through two subsidiaries: Steak n Shake Inc. (“Steak n Shake”) and Western Sizzlin Corporation (“Western Sizzlin”). As of December 31, 2020, Steak n Shake had 276 company-operated restaurants, 86 franchise partner units, and 194 traditional franchise units. Of the 276 company-operated units, 57 are currently closed but Steak n Shake intends to reopen most of them. Western Sizzlin had 3 company-operated restaurants and 39 franchise units.
Steak n Shake franchises and operates its restaurants. Founded in 1934 in Normal, Illinois, on Route 66, Steak n Shake is a classic American brand serving premium burgers and milkshakes. Steak n Shake is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana.
Western Sizzlin primarily franchises its restaurants. Founded in 1962 in Augusta, Georgia, Western Sizzlin offers signature steak dishes as well as other classic American menu items. Western Sizzlin also operates two other concepts: Great American Steak & Buffet, and Wood Grill Buffet. Western Sizzlin is headquartered in Roanoke, Virginia.
In response to COVID-19, our restaurants were required to close their dining rooms during the first quarter of 2020, and the majority of those dining rooms remained closed for the remainder of the year. We follow the guidance of health officials in determining the appropriate restrictions to put in place for each restaurant. We intend to reopen dining rooms after converting Steak n Shake’s full-service model into a self-service one. We are unable to fully predict the impact that COVID-19 will continue to have on our and our franchisees’ operations going forward.
Company-Operated Restaurants
A typical company-operated restaurant management team consists of a general manager, a restaurant manager and other managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant. Each restaurant’s general manager has primary responsibility for the day-to-day operations of his or her unit. Restaurant operations obtain food products and supplies from independent national distributors. Purchases are centrally negotiated to ensure uniformity in product quality.
Franchise Partner Restaurants
Steak n Shake offers a franchise partner program to transition company-operated restaurants to franchise partnerships. The franchise agreement stipulates that the franchisee make an upfront investment totaling $10,000. Steak n Shake, as the franchisor, assesses a fee of up to 15% of sales as well as 50% of profits. Potential franchise partners are screened based on entrepreneurial attitude and ability, but they become franchise partners based on achievement. Each must meet the gold standard in service. Franchise partners are required to be hands-on operators, limited to a single location.
Traditional Franchise Restaurants
Restaurant operations’ traditional franchising program extends the brands to areas in which there are no current development plans for company stores. The expansion plans include seeking qualified new franchisees and expanding relationships with current franchisees. Restaurant operations typically seek franchisees with both the financial resources necessary to fund successful development and significant experience in the restaurant/retail business. Both restaurant chains assist franchisees 
with the development and ongoing operation of their restaurants. In addition, personnel assist franchisees with site selection, approve restaurant sites, and provide prototype plans, construction support, and specifications. Restaurant operations’ staff provides both on-site and off-site instruction to franchise restaurant management and associates. 
International
We have a corporate office in Monaco and an international organization with personnel in various functions to support our international business. As of December 31, 2020, we operated four company locations in Europe to promote the Steak n Shake brand to prospective franchisees. Similar to our traditional domestic franchise agreements, a typical international franchise development agreement includes development and franchise fees in addition to subsequent royalty fees based on the gross sales of each restaurant. As of December 31, 2020, there were a total of 39 franchise units in Europe and the Middle East.
Competition
The restaurant business is one of the most intensely competitive industries. As there are virtually no barriers to entry into the restaurant business, competitors may include national, regional and local establishments. Restaurant businesses compete on the basis of price, convenience, service, experience, menu variety and product quality. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national, regional, and local economic conditions. The performance of individual restaurants may be impacted by factors such as traffic patterns, demographic trends, weather conditions, and competing restaurants. 
Because of government actions to contain the spread of COVID-19, our restaurants were required to close their dining rooms during the first quarter of 2020. Many of our competitors reopened their dining rooms in 2020, whereas the majority of our dining rooms remained closed as of December 31, 2020.
Government regulations
The Company is subject to various global, federal, state and local laws affecting its restaurant operations. Each of the restaurants must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, i.e., health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. 
Various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees, e.g., minimum wage, overtime pay, unemployment tax, health insurance, and workers’ compensation. Federal, state and local government agencies have established regulations requiring that we disclose nutritional information. 
Trademark and licenses
The name and reputation of Steak n Shake is a material asset and management protects it and other service marks through appropriate registrations.
Insurance Business
Biglari Holdings’ insurance activities are conducted through two insurance entities. Our insurance businesses provide insurance of property and casualty. 
On March 9, 2020, Biglari Holdings acquired the stock of Southern Pioneer Property & Casualty Insurance Company, and its agency, Southern Pioneer Insurance Agency, Inc. (collectively “Southern Pioneer”). Our insurance business is composed of First Guard Insurance Company and its agency, 1st Guard Corporation (collectively “First Guard”), and Southern Pioneer. 
The insurance business is stringently regulated by state insurance departments. Insurers based in the United States are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. First Guard and Southern Pioneer operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers are financially solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority to suspend or revoke a company’s authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions and other transactions of extraordinary amounts are subject to prior regulatory approval. Insurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium rates. Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance industry. 
First Guard is a direct underwriter of commercial truck insurance, selling physical damage and nontrucking liability insurance to truckers. First Guard competes for truck insurance with other companies. The commercial truck insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. Vigorous competition is provided by large, well-capitalized companies and by small regional insurers. First Guard’s insurance products are marketed primarily through direct response methods via the Internet or by telephone. First Guard’s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods enable it to be a low-cost insurer. First 
Guard uses its own claim staff to manage claims. Seasonal variations in First Guard’s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of claims. First Guard is headquartered in Venice, Florida. 
Southern Pioneer underwrites garage liability and commercial property as well as homeowners and dwelling fire insurance on an admitted basis. Insurance coverages are offered nationwide, primarily through insurance agents. Southern Pioneer competes with large companies and local insurers. Southern Pioneer is headquartered in Jonesboro, Arkansas.
Biglari Holdings’ insurance operations may be affected by extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of claims.
Oil and Gas Business
On September 9, 2019, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Southern Oil Company, acquired the stock of Southern Oil of Louisiana Inc. (collectively “Southern Oil”). Southern Oil primarily operates oil and natural gas properties offshore in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Southern Oil is headquartered in Madisonville, Louisiana.
The oil and gas industry is fundamentally a commodity business. Southern Oil’s operations and earnings, therefore, may be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. The COVID-19 pandemic caused oil demand to decrease significantly during the second and third quarters of 2020, which created oversupplied markets and lower commodity prices and margins. In response, the Company cut production and expenses in its oil and natural gas business. Southern Oil competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies. In addition, the Company is subject to a variety of risks inherent in the oil and gas businesses, including a wide range of local, state, and federal regulations.
Media and Licensing Business
Maxim’s business lies principally in media and licensing. Maxim is headquartered in New York City, New York.
Maxim competes for licensing business with other companies. The nature of the licensing business is predicated on projects that materialize with irregularity. In addition, publishing is a highly competitive business. The Company's magazines and related publishing products and services compete with other mass media, including the Internet.
Maxim products are marketed under various registered brand names, including, but not limited to, “MAXIM®” and “Maxim®”.
Investments
The Company and its subsidiaries have invested in The Lion Fund, L.P. and The Lion Fund II, L.P. (collectively, “the investment partnerships”). The investment partnerships operate as private investment funds. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the investments was $590.9 million. These investments are subject to a rolling five-year lock-up period under the terms of the respective partnership agreements.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, the Company employed 3,862 persons. When hiring personnel, we do not consider circumstances of birth, race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or any other factor unrelated to talent. The factor of prime importance to us, talent, is invariably found across a wide spectrum of humanity. We seek to associate with people of high character and competence.
