Corporate Background
 
General
 
mLight Tech, Inc. (the "Company" or "mLight") was founded in September 2010 to provide software solutions that simplify the management of networked personal computers. mLight originally planned to develop products to automate network inventory and reporting, diagramming and documentation, problem identification and resolution, and compliance. On September 3, 2010, a total of 9,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to our then sole officer and director, Edward Sanders, all of which are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 of the Rules and Regulations of the SEC promulgated under the Securities Act. On January 31, 2011, the Company sold 1,200,000 shares of its common stock to 24 shareholders pursuant to a Registration Statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on October 7, 2010 (file no.333-169805), as amended by Registration Statement on Form S-1/A on November 10, 2010, November 29, 2010, December 13, 2010, and declared effective on December 16, 2010. Subsequently, on February 26, 2013, the Company effectuated a 20-for-1 forward split of its common stock.

On June 7, 2013, the Board of Directors elected Todd Sudeck as President, Secretary, CFO and sole director of the Company and accepted the resignation of Edward Sanders as President and sole director of the Company. On August 1, 2013, Todd Sudeck acquired all of the capital stock of the Company owned by Edward Sanders, consisting of 180,000,000 shares of common stock, which constituted approximately 88.2% of the then total issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
 
On October 31, 2013, mLight acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of The Ding King Training Institute, Inc. ("Ding King" or "DKTI") an entity controlled by Todd Sudeck, our sole officer and director. As a result of the closing of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale of Stock, the Company acquired Ding King and Ding King became the wholly-owned subsidiary of mLight.

An enrolled student may cancel his or her enrollment in a training program by means of a written notice of cancellation. The cancellation period is one business day, i.e., until midnight of the day a course of study commences; provided that for any training program longer than 50 days, a notice of cancellation must be given prior to midnight of the fifth business day after the first class the student attends. A business day is a day on which the student was scheduled to attend a class. The refund of tuition is based upon the hourly rate for the course (less equipment costs) and equals the hourly rate times the number of unused hours of class time subsequent to the cancellation notice. Equipment, manuals, etc. must be returned within 3 days of the notice of cancellation in a new condition to be eligible for refund of that part of the tuition costs.
 
Competition
 
The Automotive Appearance/PDR Training services market is an extremely competitive, fragmented and price-sensitive sector and it is difficult to determine our expected market share in this market. Because of the geographic constraints of being located solely in Southern California, we are forced to offer transportation and hotel accommodation package which increases the overall costs to our students. We began to offer our services at locations in other parts of the United States. We believe this can increase our market share and profit margins. However, we will most likely never be a majority market share holder due to the fragmentation of the market.
