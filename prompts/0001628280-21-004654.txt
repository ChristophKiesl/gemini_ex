Item 1. Business.
THE COMPANY
Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Cumberland,” the “Company,” or as used in the context of “we,” “us,” or “our”), is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of branded prescription products. Our primary target markets are hospital acute care, gastroenterology and rheumatology. These medical specialties are characterized by relatively concentrated prescriber bases that we believe can be penetrated effectively by small, targeted sales forces. Cumberland is dedicated to providing innovative products that improve the quality of care for patients and address poorly met medical needs. We promote our approved products through our hospital and field sales forces in the United States and are establishing a network of international partners to register and provide our medicines to patients in their countries.
Our portfolio of FDA approved brands include:
•Acetadote® (acetylcysteine) Injection, for the treatment of acetaminophen poisoning; 
•Caldolor® (ibuprofen) Injection, for the treatment of pain and fever;
•Kristalose® (lactulose) for Oral Solution, a prescription laxative, for the treatment of chronic and acute constipation;
•Omeclamox®-Pak, (omeprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin) for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and related duodenal ulcer disease;
•Vaprisol® (conivaptan) Injection, to raise serum sodium levels in hospitalized patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia;
•Vibativ® (telavancin) Injection, for the treatment of certain serious bacterial infections including hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, as well as complicated skin and skin structure infections; and
•RediTrex® (methotrexate) Injection, for the treatment of active rheumatoid, juvenile idiopathic and severe psoriatic arthritis, as well as disabling psoriasis.
In addition to these commercial brands, we have Phase II clinical programs underway evaluating our ifetroban product candidates in patients with cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (“DMD”), a degenerative disease, Systemic Sclerosis (“SSc”), a deadly autoimmune condition, and Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease ("AERD"), a severe form of asthma. 
Cumberland has built core competencies in both product development and commercial capabilities. We have established the capabilities needed to acquire, develop and commercialize branded pharmaceuticals in the U.S. and believe we can leverage this existing infrastructure to support our expected growth. Our management team consists of pharmaceutical industry veterans experienced in business development, product development, regulatory, manufacturing, sales, marketing and finance. Our business development team identifies, evaluates and negotiates product acquisition, licensing and co-promotion agreements. Our product development team creates proprietary product formulations, manages our clinical studies, prepares all regulatory submissions and staffs our medical call center. Our quality and manufacturing professionals oversee the manufacture, release and shipment of our products. Our marketing and sales team is responsible for our commercial activities, and we work closely with our distribution partners to ensure availability and delivery of our products.
Cumberland's growth strategy involves maximizing the potential of our existing brands, while continuing to build a portfolio of differentiated products. We currently feature seven FDA products approved for sale in the United States. Through our international partners, we are working to bring our medicines to patients in their countries. We also look for opportunities to expand our products into additional patient populations through clinical trials, through new presentations, and through our support for select, investigator-initiated studies. We actively pursue opportunities to acquire additional marketed products, as well as late-stage development product candidates in our target medical specialties. Our clinical team is developing a pipeline of new product candidates largely to address poorly met and unmet medical needs.
 We are supplementing these activities with the earlier stage drug development at Cumberland Emerging Technologies ("CET"), our majority-owned subsidiary. CET partners with academic research institutions to identify and progress promising, new product candidates, which Cumberland has the opportunity to further develop and commercialize.
We were incorporated in 1999 and have been headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee since inception. During 2009, we completed an initial public offering of our common shares and listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Our website address is www.cumberlandpharma.com. We make available through our website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all material press releases, other filings and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after their filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, (“SEC”). These filings are also available to the public at www.sec.gov.
COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the U.S. declared a health care emergency following the outbreak of the (SARS-CoV-2), a novel strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19, a respiratory illness. The Company managed through the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, continuing to operate our business - keeping facilities open and our organization intact. We also maintained our ongoing compliance with the many laws and regulations that apply to us as a publicly traded, pharmaceutical company.
Throughout the pandemic, Cumberland faced the same headwinds affecting other companies that rely on hospital admissions and patient visits to drive revenue. Our business and our clinical studies were impacted as less patients sought elective surgeries and our access to medical facilities was substantially limited. During 2020, we carefully monitored our supply chain during the pandemic including the flow of raw materials into the plants that manufacture our products as well as the batches of finished product emerging from those facilities. Several of our brands were negatively impacted by the lockdowns and postponement of physician office visits and elective procedures. However, we are fortunate to have a diversified product portfolio, with other brands delivering a strong performance.

Acetadote®
Acetadote is an intravenous formulation of N-acetylcysteine, indicated for the treatment of the liver toxicity associated with acetaminophen poisoning. Acetadote has been available in the United States since Cumberland's 2004 introduction of the product through our hospital sales force. Acetadote is typically used in hospital emergency departments to prevent or lessen potential liver damage resulting from an overdose of acetaminophen, a common ingredient in many over-the-counter and prescription pain relieving and fever-reducing products. Acetaminophen overdose continues to be a leading cause of poisonings reported by hospital emergency departments in the United States, and Acetadote has become a standard of care for treating this potentially life-threatening condition.
Acetadote received U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approval as an orphan drug, which provided seven years of marketing exclusivity from the date of approval. In connection with the FDA's approval of Acetadote, we committed to certain post-marketing activities for the product. Completion of our first Phase IV commitment resulted in the FDA's 2006 approval of expanded labeling for the product for use in pediatric patients. Completion of our second Phase IV commitment resulted in further revised labeling for the product with FDA approval of additional safety data in 2008. Completion of our third and final Phase IV commitment in 2010 culminated in the FDA’s approval of a new formulation for the product. The next generation formulation, contains no ethylene diamine tetracetic acid ("EDTA") or other stabilization agent, chelating agent or preservative. In early 2011, Cumberland introduced this new Acetadote formulation replacing the original form of the product which we no longer manufacture.
In June 2013, the FDA approved updated labeling for Acetadote revising the product's indication and providing new dosing guidance for specific patient populations. As a result, dosing guidance is now included for patients weighing over 100 kg, and new language has been added to alert health care providers that, in certain clinical situations, therapy should be extended for some patients.
Beginning in 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the "USPTO") issued us a series of patents associated with our Acetadote product. These patents are discussed in Part I, Item I, "Business - Trademarks and Patents" of this Form 10-K. On November 8, 2012, we learned that the FDA approved an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) filed by InnoPharma, Inc. and referencing Acetadote. That product, with the old formulation containing EDTA, was subsequently introduced by APP, a division of Fresenius Kabi USA, at the end of 2012. 
In early 2013, we entered into an agreement with Perrigo Company resulting in the distribution of our Authorized Generic acetylcysteine injection (our "Authorized Generic") product. Both Acetadote and our Authorized Generic utilize the new, EDTA-free formulation which accounted for continued significant market share during 2020. 
In November 2015, an Illinois judge issued a final ruling in favor of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. in a patent case associated with Acetadote. By ruling in Cumberland's favor, the court upheld the validity of the patent which encompasses our EDTA-Free formulation and has a term until August 2025. The court also granted a permanent injunction preventing challengers from marketing a generic version of our proprietary Acetadote product formulation before the expiration of Cumberland’s patent in August 2025.
On January 26, 2017, an Appeals Court affirmed the District Court ruling in the Company's favor upholding Cumberland's Acetadote patent and expressly rejected the validity challenge.
During 2020 we continued to distribute our Acetadote brand and, through Perrigo Company, our Authorized Generic product.
Caldolor®
Caldolor, our intravenous formulation of ibuprofen, was the first injectable product approved in the U.S. for the treatment of both pain and fever. We conducted a series of clinical studies in over nine hundred adult patients to develop the data to support our FDA submission for the product's registration. The FDA approved Caldolor for marketing in the United States in 2009 following a priority review. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ("NSAID"), the product was indicated for use in adults as a sole treatment for the management of mild to moderate pain and for the management of moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics. It was also the first FDA approved intravenous therapy for treating fever. 
In late 2009, we launched Caldolor and stocked the product at major wholesalers serving hospitals nationwide. We initially worked to establish a core group of medical facilities approving and purchasing the product and then focused on building more sales volume and treating a broader range of patients within those stocked facilities. We promote Caldolor in the United States through our dedicated hospital sales force. 
We completed a series of Phase IV studies to gather additional data to support our Caldolor product. Those clinical trials involved another 1,000 patients, adult and pediatric patients. These studies included data on a shortened infusion time and pre-surgical administration of the product. To address our Phase IV commitment to the FDA, these studies also included evaluation of the product for the reduction of fever in hospitalized children and the treatment of pain in children undergoing tonsillectomy surgeries. 
In 2015 we received FDA approval for the use of Caldolor in pediatric patients six months of age and older. Caldolor is the first and only injectable non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved for use in children. We then initiated a study to collect data on the use of Caldolor in children ranging in age from birth up to six months of age. Enrollment in that study was completed in 2019. 
In early 2018, we completed and filed the application for FDA approval of a next generation Caldolor product featuring an improved presentation and formulation. In April 2018, the FDA determined that the application was complete and notified us of their acceptance of the submission for review. There were then a number of communications with questions addressed through multiple amendments that were submitted to the application. 
In January 2019, the FDA approved the application for our next generation Caldolor product. The new, premixed presentation provides healthcare professionals a formulation that is easy to administer, helping manage the treatment of patient pain and fever, while reducing opioid consumption. It is provided in a pre-mixed bag containing 800 mg of ibuprofen in a 200 mL patented low sodium formulation for injection that is ready to use. 
It is the first and only FDA-approved pre-mixed bag of ibuprofen. Caldolor is still available as an 800 mg/8mL single–dose vial for dilution in addition to the ready-to-use bag. 
In April 2019, we began initial shipments of this next generation Caldolor product to select customers. During the third and fourth quarters of 2019, there was a growing demand for the new product from these select accounts. In January 2020, we initiated a full-scale launch of this ready-to-use product. Unfortunately, the launch was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and postponement of elective surgeries. Nonetheless, we do expect an improved performance of the product after the pandemic abates as more accounts gain access to the new presentation. 
During 2020 we distributed both the vial and the ready-to-use premixed bag presentations of Caldolor.
Kristalose®
Kristalose is a prescription laxative administered orally for the treatment of acute and chronic constipation. An innovative, dry powder crystalline formulation of lactulose, Kristalose is designed to enhance patient acceptance and compliance. Kristalose is the only prescription laxative available in pre-measured powder packets. 
Kristalose dissolves easily in four ounces of water, offering patients a virtually taste-free, grit-free and essentially calorie-free alternative to lactulose syrups. We conducted a preference study which indicated that seventy-seven percent of patients surveyed prefer the taste, consistency and portability of Kristalose over similar products in syrup forms.
We acquired exclusive U.S. commercialization rights to Kristalose in 2006, assembled a dedicated field sales force and re-launched it in September 2006 as a Cumberland brand. We directed our sales efforts to physicians who are the most prolific writers of prescription laxatives, including gastroenterologists and internists. We supplemented this personal promotion with telemarketing campaigns to expand our reach and support of the product.
In late 2011, through a series of transactions, we entered into an agreement to acquire assets associated with the Kristalose brand including the Kristalose trademark and the FDA registration. 
Using preference data as a cornerstone of our marketing efforts, we repositioned the brand in early 2014. The marketing strategy included an enhanced patient coupon program and expanded managed care coverage for the product.
We added a co-promotion partner to provide support for the brand in 2017. Poly Pharmaceuticals is promoting Kristalose to physician targets not covered by our field sales forces. In 2018, we added another partner, Foxland Pharmaceuticals, Inc., who is repackaging Kristalose and featuring it with additional new physician targets.
During 2020 we continued to support Kristalose through our field sales force as well as our partnerships with Poly Pharmaceuticals and Foxland Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Omeclamox®-Pak
Many ulcers of the gastrointestinal tract are caused by an infection from the Helicobacter pylori (“H. pylori”) bacterium. Omeclamox-Pak is a branded prescription product used for the treatment of these infections and the related duodenal ulcer disease. This innovative product combines three well-known and widely prescribed medications: omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. 
Omeclamox-Pak was the first FDA approved triple therapy combination medication to contain omeprazole as the proton pump inhibitor, which works to decrease the amount of acid the stomach produces. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin are both antibiotic agents which hinder the growth of the H. pylori bacteria. 
Interaction of these agents allows the stomach lining to heal effectively. The medications are packaged together on convenient daily dosing cards, making it simple to follow the twice a day dosing before meals.
While there are competing combination products, Omeclamox-Pak is one of the few actively marketed brands for this condition. In addition, compared to the competitors, Omeclamox-Pak involves the lowest pill burden and fewest days of therapy. Our involvement with Omeclamox-Pak began in October 2013, through a co-promotion agreement with Pernix Therapeutics ("Pernix"). 
In November 2015, Cumberland entered into an exclusive license and supply agreement with Gastro-Entero Logic, LLC (“GEL”), assumed full commercial responsibility for Omeclamox-Pak in the United States, and concluded our agreements with Pernix. Cumberland became responsible for the distribution, national accounts and all sales promotion of Omeclamox-Pak under the GEL agreement. 
In December 2018, we completed an agreement with GEL to acquire all remaining assets associated with Omeclamox-Pak including the product’s FDA approval as well as the domestic and international trademarks. The closing of this transaction ended Cumberland’s payments of royalties and manufacturing fees to GEL, and we assumed responsibility for the maintenance of the product’s FDA approval and for the oversight of the product’s manufacturing and packaging. 
Our field sales force has promoted Omeclamox-Pak to the gastroenterology market segment, which accounts for the largest component of the prescriber base for this product. We supplemented this personal promotion through telemarketing campaigns to expand the support and use of the product. We have also established a series of contracts to provide managed care coverage for Omeclamox-Pak.
The packager for Omeclamox-Pak encountered financial difficulties in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19, and their operations are currently suspended. We are awaiting resumption of those operations, while also exploring other alternatives to restart the product’s packaging. We have notified the FDA that the product is currently not available.
Vaprisol®
In early 2014, we entered into an agreement with Astellas Pharma US, Inc. ("Astellas") to acquire Vaprisol, including certain product rights, intellectual property and related assets. Vaprisol is a prescription brand indicated to raise serum sodium levels in hospitalized patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The product was developed and registered by Astellas. It is one of two branded prescription products indicated for the treatment of hyponatremia, and the only intravenously administered branded treatment. 
Hyponatremia, an imbalance of serum sodium to body water, is the most common electrolyte disorder among hospitalized patients. These electrolyte disturbances occur when the sodium ion concentration in the plasma is lower than normal and are often associated with a variety of critical care conditions including congestive heart failure, liver failure, kidney failure and pneumonia. Vaprisol raises serum sodium to appropriate levels and promotes free water secretion. 
Vaprisol is supported by our hospital sales division. Demand for the product increased during the 2020 pandemic, and we worked to ensure availability of the product to hospitals and clinics during the health care crisis. 
Vibativ®
In November 2018, the Company announced an agreement with Theravance Biopharma ("Theravance") to acquire the Vibativ assets from Theravance and assume global responsibility for the brand including the related marketing, distribution, manufacturing and regulatory activities. 
Vibativ is a patented, FDA approved injectable anti-infective for the treatment of certain serious bacterial infections including hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections. It addresses a range of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including those that are considered difficult-to-treat and multidrug-resistant. 
Immediately after the closing, we initiated shipments of Vibativ, assumed responsibility for the supply chain and distribution of the product in the U.S. and transitioned the brand's responsibilites from Theravance to Cumberland. Vibativ is supported by our hospital sales division. 
During 2020, demand for the product grew, and it was used to treat pneumonia resulting from secondary bacterial infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 
RediTrex®
In November 2016, we announced an agreement with Nordic Group B.V. to commercialize their methotrexate product line in the United States. This new line of injectable products is designed for treating patients with arthritis and psoriasis. Cumberland is responsible for the registration and commercialization of these products while Nordic will manage the product supply. Nordic has registered and is selling their methotrexate products in several European countries.
During late 2018, we completed the submission and filed with the FDA a New Drug Application for our methotrexate products. In December 2019, we received FDA approval for RediTrex and began planning for a launch of this product line. In November 2020, we provided initial shipments of RediTrex to select accounts and began preparing for a national launch in the second half of 2021, once product supplies are assured and market conditions return to normal.
PIPELINE
Our development pipeline includes a series of product candidates in Phase II development. During 2020, enrollment in our studies significantly slowed during the pandemic, due to trial suspensions and the decrease in eligible patient admissions to medical centers across the country. We look forward to an improvement as the pandemic subsides and centers begin to reopen with a return of patients eligible for our trials.
Our clinical programs include the evaluation of ifetroban in the following areas:
Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease ("AERD")
We have completed the manufacturing and initiated clinical development of an oral formulation of ifetroban under the brand name Boxaban. We are evaluating this candidate for patients suffering from Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease ("AERD"), also known as Samter’s Triad, a chronic medical condition that consists of three clinical features: asthma, sinus disease with nasal polyposis and sensitivity to aspirin. AERD is characterized by sharp increases in inflammatory mediators and platelet activity within the respiratory system. Approximately one in twenty asthmatic adults in the U.S. suffer from AERD and awareness of the disease is growing within the medical community. There is no U.S. approved pharmaceutical treatment for AERD.
We completed an initial Phase II clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Boxaban in AERD patients. The multicenter study involved sixteen patients at several U.S. medical centers led by the Scripps Research Institute. Results indicated that Boxaban was well tolerated with no safety concerns noted in patients with a history of AERD.
In early 2017, the FDA cleared Cumberland’s IND application for the Company’s AERD clinical program. Following this clearance, we initiated a follow-on multicenter Phase II efficacy study to evaluate the efficacy of Boxaban in seventy-six patients with symptomatic AERD. 
Systemic Sclerosis ("SSc")
In April 2016, we announced the addition of Vasculan to our pipeline. Through Cumberland's ifetroban program, Cumberland has initiated the clinical development of ifetroban oral capsules for the treatment of systemic sclerosis. 
Systemic sclerosis ("SSc"), also called scleroderma, is a debilitating autoimmune disorder characterized by diffuse fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, as well as vascular dysfunction. Preclinical studies have shown that ifetroban prevents and can restore cardiac function in a preclinical model of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 This disease has a high morbidity and the highest case-specific mortality of any rheumatic disorder with 50% of patients dying or developing major internal organ complications within 3 years of diagnosis. Although several medications are used to treat the skin disease associated with SSc, there is no universally effective treatment to improve the function of affected internal organs such as the lungs, heart, and gastrointestinal tract.
The FDA has cleared our IND application to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Vasculan in patients with SSc. As a result, we initiated a Phase II multicenter study in thirty-four SSc patients. 
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ("DMD")
On September 24, 2019, Cumberland announced an FDA Orphan Drug Grant funding for a new Phase II clinical program. The Company has initiated the clinical development of ifetroban for the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (“DMD”). Based on preclinical findings, the FDA has cleared Cumberland’s application to study ifetroban in DMD patients, 7 years of age and older. In addition, Cumberland has been awarded just over $1 million in funding from the FDA through their Orphan Drug Grant program to support this Phase II DMD clinical study. It is the first DMD clinical study approved for FDA Orphan Product Development funding. During 2020 the FDA awarded a supplemental grant in support of the Phase II study.
Other Clinical Programs
We have also completed Phase II clinical programs with ifetroban in patients with Hepatorenal Syndrome (“HRS”) and patients with Portal Hypertension (“PH”). Additional pilot studies of ifetroban are underway including several investigator-initiated trials. We are awaiting further study results before deciding on the best path for approval for ifetroban, our first new chemical entity.
New Hospital Product Candidate
Cumberland was responsible for the formulation, development and FDA approval of both Acetadote and Caldolor. Our Medical Advisory Board has helped us identify additional opportunities that address unmet or poorly met medical needs. As a result, Cumberland has successfully designed, formulated and completed the preclinical studies for a cholesterol reducing agent for use in the hospital setting. 
 During 2017, we completed a Phase I study which defined the pharmacokinetic properties and provided a favorable safety profile for this new product candidate. The study results and a proposed clinical development plan were discussed with the FDA. A Phase II study has been initiated and and patient enrollment completed. We have completed the study report, filed it with the FDA and are now determining the next steps for this program.
OUR STRATEGY
Our growth strategy involves maximizing the potential of our existing brands while continuing to build a portfolio of differentiated products. We currently market seven FDA approved products for sale in the United States. Through our international partners, we are working to bring our products to patients in their countries. We also look for opportunities to expand our products into additional patient populations through clinical trials, new indications, and select investigator-initiated studies. We actively pursue opportunities to acquire additional marketed products as well as late-stage development product candidates in our target medical specialties. Our clinical team is developing a pipeline of new product candidates to address unmet medical needs. Further, we are supplementing these activities with the early stage drug development activities at CET, our majority-owned subsidiary. Specifically, we are seeking long term sustainable growth by executing the following plans:    
Support and expand the use of our marketed products. We continue to evaluate our products following their FDA approval to determine if additional clinical data could expand their market and use. We will continue to explore opportunities for label expansion to bring our products to new patient populations. As examples, we have secured pediatric approval, expanding the labeling for both our Acetadote and Caldolor brands. 
Selectively add complementary brands. In addition to our product development activities, we are also seeking to acquire products or late-stage development product candidates to continue to build a portfolio of complementary brands. We focus on under-promoted, FDA-approved drugs as well as late-stage development products that address poorly met medical needs. We will continue to target product acquisition candidates that are competitively differentiated, have valuable intellectual property or other protective features, and allow us to leverage our existing infrastructure. Our acquisition of Vibativ represents the largest product acquisition we have completed.
Progress clinical pipeline and incubate future product opportunities at CET. We believe it is important to build a pipeline of innovative new product opportunities. Our ifetroban Phase II development programs represent the implementation of this strategy. At CET, we are supplementing our acquisition and late-stage development activities with the early-stage drug development activities. CET partners with universities and other research organizations to develop promising, early-stage product candidates, which Cumberland has the opportunity to further develop and commercialize. 
Leverage our infrastructure through co-promotion partnerships. We believe that our commercial infrastructure can help drive prescription volume and product sales. We look for strategic partners that can complement our capabilities and enhance the opportunity for our brands. Our co-promotion partnership with Poly Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Foxland Pharmaceuticals, Inc. allow us to expand the support for Kristalose across the United States. 
Build an international contribution to our business. We have established our own commercial capabilities, including two sales divisions to cover the U.S. market for our products. We are also building a network of select international partners to register our products and make them available to patients in their countries. We will continue to develop and expand our network of international partners while supporting our partners’ registration and commercialization efforts in their respective territories. The acquisition of Vibativ resulted in several new international partners and market opportunities.
Manage our operations with financial discipline. We continually work to manage our expenses in line with our revenues in order to deliver positive cash flow from operations. We remain in a strong financial position, with favorable gross margins, and a strong balance sheet. 
SALES AND MARKETING
Our sales and marketing team has broad industry experience in selling branded pharmaceuticals. Our sales and marketing professionals manage our dedicated hospital and gastroenterology sales forces, including approximately 50 sales representatives and district managers, direct our national marketing campaigns and maintain key national account relationships. 
Hospital market: We promote Caldolor, Vaprisol, Acetadote, and Vibativ through our dedicated hospital sales division. This organization targets key hospitals across the U.S. and is comprised of sales professionals with substantial experience in the hospital market. Independent market data continues to indicate that the majority of pharmaceutical promotional spending is directed toward large, outpatient markets on drugs intended for chronic use rather than short-term, hospital use. 
We believe the hospital market is under-served and highly concentrated, and that it can be penetrated effectively by a small, dedicated sales force without large-scale promotional activity. Our established position in the hospital market provided the rationale for adding Vibativ as our first infectious disease product that complement our hospital product line. Our strategy has been to increase the focus of our hospital sales team on targeted, high priority accounts. 
Gastroenterology and rheumatology market: We promote Kristalose, Omeclamox-Pak and RediTrex through a dedicated field sales team addressing a targeted group of physicians who are large prescribers of the products. Because the markets for gastrointestinal and rheumatology diseases are broad in patient scope, yet relatively narrow in physician base, we believe they provide opportunities that can be penetrated with a modest sized sales force. By investing in our sales and marketing activities we believe that we can increase market share for these products. 
Our commercial executives conduct ongoing analyses to evaluate marketing campaigns and promotional programs in support of our brands. The evaluations include development of product profiles, testing of the profiles against the needs of the market, determining what additional product information or development work is needed to effectively market the products and preparing financial forecasts. 
We utilize professional branding and packaging as well as promotional items to support our products, including direct mail, sales brochures, journal advertising, educational and reminder leave-behinds, patient educational pieces, coupons, and product sampling. We also regularly attend select medical meetings and trade shows to expand the awareness of our products. 
Our national accounts function is responsible for key large buyers and related marketing programs. National accounts maintain relationships with our wholesaler customers as well as with third-party payors such as group purchasing organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, hospital buying groups, state and federal government purchasers and health insurance companies.

CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT AND STUDY RESULTS 
Vibativ Clinical Manuscripts
Vibativ is a patented, FDA-approved injectable anti-infective for the treatment of certain serious bacterial infections including hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections. It addresses a range of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including those that are considered difficult-to-treat and multidrug-resistant. In November 2018, Cumberland reached an agreement to acquire Vibativ from Theravance Biopharma and assume global responsibility for the product.
In late 2019, we announced a publication in Infectious Diseases and Therapy, with study results showing numerically superior cure rates of telavancin compared to vancomycin within a subset of patients who were enrolled in Phase 3 ATTAIN trials and had hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by bacteria with low susceptibility to vancomycin. Additionally, an online publication in Drugs - Real World Outcomes, detailed the positive clinical outcomes that resulted from treating multiple infection types with Vibativ, including complicated skin infections, bone and joint infections, bacteremia and endocarditis, and lower respiratory tract infections.
In May 2020, Cumberland announced a new study published in Drugs - Real World Outcomes, detailing the positive clinical outcomes that resulted from treating patients with bacteremia or endocarditis with Vibativ. This publication is a sub analysis of The Telavancin Observational Use Registry (TOUR™), a study conducted to record population characteristics, prescription information, and real-world clinical outcomes of patients with Gram-positive infections treated with Vibativ. The analysis suggests Vibativ is a promising and viable option for patients with bacteremia or endocarditis, including those with MRSA or another S. aureus pathogen.
Additionally, in May 2020, we announced the publication of two studies confirming the continued in vitro potency of telavancin. Both publications were part of continued surveillance of telavancin activity since 2011.  The first publication tested a global collection of 24,408 Gram-positive clinical isolates, and the second publication tested a U.S. collection of 15,882 S. aureus isolates. Both studies documented the sustained in vitro antimicrobial activity and spectrum of telavancin—many years after its clinical approval—against Gram-positive clinical isolates collected worldwide over 7 years, from 2011 through 2017.
Caldolor Clinical Manuscripts
In July 2020, Cumberland announced a study published in the Journal of Orthopedic Trauma, evaluating the efficacy of Caldolor administration in the management of acute pain in orthopedic trauma patients. The study also measured Caldolor’s ability in minimizing opioid use. This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that Caldolor (ibuprofen) Injection reduced the quantity of opioids required to manage pain after a traumatic injury with fracture. In addition, the time to first narcotic medication was longer in the Caldolor group than with hospital standard of care. Pain was also managed better in the Caldolor group compared to standard of care narcotics. 
Additionally, in August 2020, we announced the results of a review of nine clinical studies evaluating Caldolor. The comprehensive review was published in the journal Clinical Therapeutics and involved 1,062 adult patients, with 757 receiving Caldolor and 305 receiving placebo or a comparator medication. The data noted that the use of Caldolor improved post-surgery recovery, decreased surgical stress, and reduced the use of opioids and over-the-counter medication. The study determined that patients given Caldolor experienced less postoperative pain and decreased opioid use. Study authors also concluded that the rapid administration and preemptive use of Caldolor should be considered in Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols for the management of postoperative pain including that of traumatic origin. 
Caldolor Newborn Study
We previously received FDA approval for the use of Caldolor in pediatric patients six months of age and older. Caldolor is the first and only injectable NSAID approved for use in children. We then initiated a study to collect data on the use of Caldolor in children ranging in age from birth up to six months of age. Enrollment in that multi-center study was completed in 2019, and topline results were announced in 2020, indicating that Caldolor was well tolerated in this patient population, with no safety concerns noted. 
Ifetroban Phase II Studies
We have been evaluating our ifetroban product candidate in a series of clinical studies. We have three Phase II clinical programs underway evaluating our ifetroban product candidates in 1) patients with cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a rare, fatal, genetic neuromuscular disease results in deterioration of the skeletal, heart and lung muscles, 2) Systemic Sclerosis or scleroderma, a debilitating autoimmune disorder characterized by diffuse fibrosis of the skin and internal organs and 3) Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease, a severe form of asthma. 
In addition, we have completed two pilot Phase II studies involving 1) patients suffering from Hepatorenal Syndrome, a life-threatening condition involving liver and kidney failure and 2) patients with Portal Hypertension associated with chronic liver disease.
Additional pilot studies of ifetroban are underway, including several investigator-initiated trials. 
Enrollment in our clinical studies was interrupted during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While enrollment of new patients is currently limited, we have worked to ensure that patients already entered into a trial continue to receive their study drug. Many of our clinical study sites have reopened and resumed screening of patients for potential enrollment into our studies. We are awaiting results from the studies underway before deciding on the best development path for the registration of ifetroban, our first new chemical entity.
 New Hospital Product Candidate Study
Cumberland was responsible for the formulation, development and FDA approval of both Acetadote and Caldolor. Our Medical Advisory Board has helped us identify additional opportunities that address unmet or poorly met medical needs. As a result, Cumberland has successfully designed, formulated and completed the preclinical studies for a cholesterol reducing agent for use in the hospital setting. 
During 2017, we completed a Phase I study which defined the pharmacokinetic properties and provided a favorable safety profile for this new product candidate. The study results and a proposed clinical development plan were discussed with the FDA.
 A Phase II study has been initiated and patient enrollment completed. We have completed the study report, filed it with the FDA and are now determining the next steps for this product development program.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Since inception, we have had an active business development program focused on acquiring rights to marketed products and product candidates that fit our strategy and target markets. We source business development opportunities through our international network of advisory firms and individual pharmaceutical industry and medical advisors. A multi-disciplinary internal management team reviews these opportunities on a regular basis using a list of selection criteria. We have historically focused on product opportunities that are a strategic fit with our commercial organization, development expertise and medical focus, employing a variety of transaction structures. 
We intend to continue to build a portfolio of complementary, niche products largely through product acquisitions and late-stage product development. 
Our primary targets are under-promoted, FDA approved drugs with existing brand recognition and late-stage development product candidates that address unmet or poorly met medical needs in the hospital acute care and gastroenterology markets. We believe that by focusing mainly on approved or late-stage products, we can minimize the significant risk, cost and time associated with drug development. 
Early in 2019, we announced a strategic review of our brands, capabilities, and international partners. This review followed an accelerated business development initiative, which resulted in a series of transactions. Because of that progress, we felt that it was prudent to take a fresh look at our product portfolio, partners, and organization to ensure proper focus and capabilities. 
International Partners
As a result of our strategic review, we altered our international arrangements through several new agreements as well as dissolution of prior agreements..
We executed a License and Distribution agreement with HongKong WinHealth Pharma Group Co. Limited (“WinHealth”) for our Caldolor and Acetadote brands in China and Hong Kong. Under the terms of the agreement, WinHealth will provide development milestone payments and purchase supplies of the products following their registration in China.
We also entered into a Strategic Alliance agreement with WinHealth to explore future business opportunities that will further the mission and goals of each organization. Founded in Hangzhou, China and currently headquartered in Hong Kong, WinHealth has developed a wide breadth of capabilities including drug licensing, product development and registration, and has established a strong network of distribution and sales promotional capabilities for the Chinese market. WinHealth has established partnerships with international companies that include Boehringer-Ingelheim, Janssen, Novartis, Pfizer, and Roche, generating approximately $330 million in annual sales in 2018.
In August 2020, we entered into an agreement with WinHealth Investment (Singapore) Ltd creating WHC Biopharmaceuticals, Pte. Ltd. The joint venture will focus on acquiring, developing, registering, and commercializing development stage and commercial stage biopharmaceuticals for China, Hong Kong and other Asian markets.
Additionally, we completed the assignment and amendment of a Commercialization Agreement with R-Pharma JSC (“R Pharma”) associated with ongoing distribution of Vibativ in Russia and a number of adjacent countries in Eastern Europe. R-Pharma is one of the leading multinational pharmaceutical organizations based in Russia. Headquartered in Moscow and focusing in a wide breadth of therapeutic areas in the specialty and hospital care markets, R-Pharma generated over $1.6 billion in revenues in 2018.
We are in the process of concluding our Commercialization Agreement with Hikma Pharmaceuticals LLC to register and distribute Vibativ in a number of countries throughout the Middle East, our agreement with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited for the registration and distribution of Vibativ in India, and our License and Distribution Agreement with PT. EHTICA Industri Farmasi for the registration and distribution of Caldolor in Indonesia.
Poly Co-Promotion Agreement
We entered into a co-promotion arrangement with Poly Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Poly”) for our Kristalose product in 2017. Poly is a privately held U.S. specialty pharmaceutical company that is featuring Kristalose to an expanded number of physicians. Poly’s sales organization is more than doubling the number of nationwide physicians that are reached with the Kristalose brand message. During 2019, we extended our co-promotion arrangement with Poly. 
Nordic License Agreement
In November 2016, we announced our agreement to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to Nordic Group B.V.'s injectable methotrexate product line. The products are designed for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, severe psoriatic arthritis, and severe disabling psoriasis. 
The product line is approved for patient use in various European countries and received FDA approval near the end of 2019. Cumberland has registered and is commercializing the methotrexate products in the United States under the brand name RediTrex.
2R and Foxland Agreements
During 2018, we entered into another co-promotion arrangement related to our Kristalose product. We have agreements with 2R Investments, LLC and with Foxland Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to package, distribute and promote an authorized generic form of our Kristalose product to physician targets that we do not cover. Cumberland continues to manage the regulatory activities associated with the product.
Clinigen Strategic Dissolution Agreement
We previously entered into a strategic alliance with the Clinigen Group plc ("Clinigen"), an international specialty pharmaceutical and services company, to commercialize select Clinigen products in the U.S. In May 2016, we announced an agreement with Clinigen to acquire an exclusive license and commercialize Ethyol® in the U.S. We then announced in January 2017, our second agreement with Clinigen to acquire an exclusive license and launch Totect® in the U.S.
During May 2019, following a strategic review of our partners, products and organization, we entered into a Dissolution Agreement with Clinigen in which Cumberland will return the exclusive rights to commercialize Ethyol and Totect in the United States to Clinigen. Under the final terms of the amended Dissolution Agreement we transitioned from our current arrangement with Clinigen effective December 31, 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, Cumberland will no longer be involved directly or indirectly with the distribution, marketing and promotion of either Ethyol or Totect or any competing products. In exchange for the return of these product license rights and not competing with either product, we will receive $5 million in financial consideration paid over the two-years following December 31, 2019.
CET University Collaboration Agreements
Through CET, we collaborate with a select group of academic research institutions located in the mid-south region of the U.S. to identify, co-develop and seek grant funding for promising biomedical technologies emerging from those research institutions.
CET is collaborating with Vanderbilt University, the University of Mississippi, the University of Tennessee Research Foundation, Louisiana State University, and the Medical University of South Carolina to identify, co-develop and seek grant funding for promising biomedical technologies emerging from those research institutions.
These arrangements enable CET to team with university-based researchers to advance their scientific discoveries and breakthroughs by designing new product candidates to improve patient care and address unmet medical need.
MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION
Manufacturing
 We partner with third parties for certain non-core, capital-intensive capabilities, including the manufacturing and distribution of our products. We manage these third-party relationships and are responsible for the quality review and release of each lot of our products.
Acetadote®
For Acetadote we had agreements with two manufacturers, and one manufacturer provided commercial supplies of the product during 2020. 
Caldolor®
We have agreements with multiple manufacturers for the supply of Caldolor and during 2020 we obtained commercial supplies from three of these manufacturers for our international and domestic Caldolor requirements. 
Kristalose®
We have an agreement for the purchase of Kristalose API with an international supplier. We also have manufacturing relationships with two packagers who provided finished supplies of the product for commercial and sampling purposes during 2020. 
Omeclamox-Pak®
Prior to our asset purchase agreement with GEL that closed in December 2018, GEL managed the packaging and supply of Omeclamox-Pak commercial and sample units. Following our acquisition of the remaining rights to the brand in late 2018, we assumed responsibility for the packaging and supply of the product. During 2019 we entered into a new packaging arrangement for this product.
During 2020, the packager for Cumberland’s Omeclamox-Pak product encountered financial difficulties due to the economic impact of COVID-19, and their operations suspended. Cumberland is awaiting resumption of those operations while also exploring other alternatives to restart the product’s packaging. We informed the FDA of a shortage of the Omeclamox-Pak effective October 14, 2020, and have not provided a date for the availability of new inventory.
Vaprisol®
As part of the acquisition of Vaprisol, we purchased a significant existing supply of raw material inventory. In addition, as part of that transaction, we were assigned a commercial supply agreement with the historical Vaprisol manufacturer. In 2018, the manufacturer informed us that they would no longer be able to provide the product following the manufacturing of one final batch which is providing us with a multi-year supply. We identified and reached an agreement during 2020 with a new manufacturer to provide us with long term supplies of the product. We subsequently initiated the transfer of the product’s manufacturing to the new facility in 2020.
Vibativ®
Through our acquisition of Vibativ, we acquired a multi-year supply of raw material, work in process and finished goods inventory. As a result of the agreement, we are now responsible for the future manufacture of the product and completed the transfer of the product’s manufacturing activities to a new supplier and received FDA approval for that facility in 2020.
RediTrex®
In 2016, we entered into an agreement with the Nordic Group B.V. ("Nordic") to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to Nordic’s injectable methotrexate product line. In 2019, we received FDA approval for the product and authorization to market them under the RediTrex brand name. Under our agreement with Nordic, they are responsible for providing us the packaged and labeled commercial supply of RediTrex.
Distribution
Like many pharmaceutical companies, we engage a third-party with appropriate facilities and logistical expertise to support the U.S. distribution of our products. Cardinal Health has exclusively handled our U.S. product logistics activities, including warehousing, shipping, and various other customer activities. Our primary customers are the wholesalers of pharmaceuticals who provide our products to hospitals, clinics and retail pharmacies in the U.S.
CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT
Cumberland Foundation
In December 2017, we formed the Cumberland Pharma Foundation (the "Foundation") to serve as a vehicle to facilitate the ongoing philanthropic endeavors of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
The Foundation was formed as an independent, nonprofit corporation designed to qualify as a tax-exempt organization pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Foundation’s Board of Directors is comprised of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals executives who are responsible for overseeing the Foundation’s ongoing activities including charitable contributions. 
During 2018, we provided a grant of 50,000 shares of our common stock to the Foundation. The shares will address the ongoing financial needs of the Foundation, with most of the shares expected to be held for the opportunity to realize long term appreciation to support the Foundation’s future. The Foundation maintains independent financial statements and its contributions will not impact the financial statements of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals. Initial annual grants by the Foundation have been and remain consistent with the historic level of contributions made by Cumberland Pharmaceuticals. During 2020, we provided approximately $50,000 in cash contributions to the Foundation. 
Cumberland Health and Wellness Political Action Committee
In November 2017 we formed the Cumberland Health and Wellness Political Action Committee (PAC). The objective of the PAC is to support candidates and policies that are consistent with Cumberland’s mission of advancing patient care. The PAC’s activities will be at the local, state and federal level and conducted in a bi-partisan manner. The initial committee membership is comprised of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals employees. The PAC received initial funding from us and future funding will include voluntary individual contributions from Cumberland Pharmaceuticals directors and employees. 
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
We own the trademarks for each of our branded pharmaceutical products as well as for our corporate name and logo. We have applied for trademark registration for other various names and logos. Over time, we intend to maintain registrations on trademarks that remain valuable to our business.
We seek to protect our products from competition through a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, FDA exclusivity and contractual restrictions on disclosure. Proprietary rights, including patents, are an important element of our business. We seek to protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute agreements providing for protection of our confidential information upon commencement of their employment or engagement. We also require confidentiality agreements from entities to which we provide our confidential information or materials.
Acetadote®
We developed a new formulation of Acetadote (acetylcysteine) Injection as part of a Phase IV commitment in response to a request by the FDA to evaluate the reduction of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ("EDTA") from the product's formulation. In April 2012, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,148,356 (the “356 Acetadote Patent”) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 356 Acetadote Patent encompass the new Acetadote formulation and include composition of matter claims. Following its issuance, the 356 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA 
Orange Book. The 356 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in May 2026, which time period includes a 270-day patent term adjustment granted by the USPTO.
Following the issuance of the 356 Acetadote Patent, we received separate Paragraph IV certification notices from InnoPharma, Inc. ("InnoPharma"), Paddock Laboratories, LLC (“Paddock”), Mylan Institutional LLC (“Mylan”), Sagent Agila LLC ("Sagent") and Perrigo Company ("Perrigo") challenging the 356 Acetadote Patent on the basis of non-infringement and/or invalidity. We responded by filing five separate infringement lawsuits, in the appropriate United States District Courts, to contest each of the challenges. 
On November 12, 2012, we entered into a Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Paddock and Perrigo to resolve the challenges and the pending litigation with those two companies. 
On November 1, 2013, the United States District Courts filed opinions granting Sagent’s and InnoPharma’s motions to dismiss our suits and we agreed not to file an appeal or motion to reconsider, thereby resolving the challenges and the pending litigation with those two companies. 
Under the Settlement Agreement, Paddock and Perrigo admit that the 356 Acetadote Patent is valid and enforceable and that any Paddock or Perrigo generic version of Acetadote (with or without EDTA) would infringe upon the 356 Acetadote Patent. In addition, Paddock and Perrigo will not challenge the validity, enforceability, ownership or patentability of the 356 Acetadote Patent through its expiration currently scheduled for May 2026. On November 12, 2012, in connection with the execution of the Settlement Agreement, we entered into a License and Supply Agreement with Paddock and Perrigo (the “License and Supply Agreement”). 
Under the terms of the License and Supply Agreement, if a third party receives final approval from the FDA for an ANDA to sell a generic Acetadote product and such third party made such generic version available for purchase in commercial quantities in the United States, we are to supply Perrigo with an Authorized Generic version of our Acetadote product. 
On May 18, 2012, we also submitted a Citizen Petition to the FDA requesting that the FDA refrain from approving any applications for acetylcysteine injection that contain EDTA, based in part on the FDA's request that we evaluate the reduction or removal of EDTA from our original Acetadote formulation.
On November 7, 2012, the FDA responded to the Citizen Petition denying our request and on November 8, 2012, we learned that the FDA approved the ANDA referencing Acetadote filed by InnoPharma, Inc. We brought suit against the FDA contesting the FDA's decision to approve the InnoPharma generic on November 13, 2012. 
On September 30, 2013, the United States District Court filed an opinion granting a summary judgment in favor of the FDA regarding this suit.
As noted above, during 2012 the FDA approved the ANDA referencing Acetadote filed by InnoPharma, Inc. Upon this condition, in accordance with the License and Supply agreement with Perrigo, we began to supply Perrigo with our Authorized Generic. On January 7, 2013, Perrigo announced initial distribution of our Authorized Generic acetylcysteine injection product.
On March 19, 2013, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,399,445 (the “445 Acetadote Patent”) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 445 Acetadote Patent encompass the use of the 200 mg/ml Acetadote formulation to treat patients with acetaminophen overdose. On April 8, 2013, the 445 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book. The 445 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in August 2025. Following the issuance of the 445 Acetadote Patent we received separate Paragraph IV certification notices from Perrigo, Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Mylan challenging the 445 Acetadote Patent on the basis of non-infringement, unenforceability and/or invalidity.
On June 10, 2013, we became aware of a Paragraph IV certification notice from Akorn, Inc. challenging the 445 Acetadote Patent and the 356 Acetadote Patent on the basis of non-infringement.

to treat patients with acetaminophen overdose. Following its issuance, the 061 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book. The 061 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in August 2025.
On May 13, 2014, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,722,738 (the “738 Acetadote Patent”) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 738 Acetadote Patent encompass administration methods of acetylcysteine injection, without specification of the presence or lack of EDTA in the injection. Following its issuance, the 738 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book and it is scheduled to expire in April 2032. 
On December 11, 2014 and March 3, 2015, we became aware of Paragraph IV certification notices from Aurobindo Pharma Limited and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc., respectively, challenging the 356, 445, 061, and 738 Acetadote Patents on the basis of non-infringement.
On February 10, 2015, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,952,065 (the “065 Acetadote Patent”) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 065 Acetadote Patent encompass the use of the 200 mg/ml Acetadote formulation to treat patients with acute liver failure. The 065 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in August 2025.
On September 30, 2015, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division ("District Court") ruled in our favor in our lawsuit against Mylan for infringement of the 445 Acetadote Patent. The opinion upheld our 445 Acetadote Patent and expressly rejected Mylan's validity challenge. The District Court ruled that Mylan is liable to us for infringement of the 445 Acetadote patent in light of Mylan's Abbreviated New Drug Application in which Mylan sought to market a generic version of Acetadote. 
On November 17, 2015, the District Court entered an order enjoining Mylan and its affiliates from selling or using its generic version of Acetadote until August 2025, the date of expiration of the 445 Acetadote Patent. On October 30, 2015, Mylan filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the "Appeals Court").
On May 3, 2016, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 9,327,028 (the “028 Acetadote Patent”) which is assigned to us.

COMPETITION
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our continued success in developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products will depend, in part, upon our ability to compete against existing and future products in our target markets. Competitive factors directly affecting our markets include but are not limited to: 
•product attributes such as efficacy, safety, ease-of-use and cost-effectiveness; 
•brand awareness and recognition driven by sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; 
•intellectual property and other exclusivity rights; 
•availability of resources to build and maintain developmental and commercial capabilities; 
•successful business development activities; 
•extent of third-party reimbursements, insurance coverage; and 
•establishment of advantageous collaborations to conduct development, manufacturing or commercialization efforts.
A number of our competitors possess research and development and sales and marketing capabilities as well as financial resources greater than ours. These competitors, in addition to emerging companies and academic research institutions, may be developing, or in the future could develop, new technologies that could compete with our current and future products or render our products obsolete.
Our products face competition from other branded products, generics, and alternate medical treatments. Our task is to position each brand to feature its competitive advantages, implement a well thought out marketing plan and provide focused sales and other tactical support. 
Acetadote®
Acetadote is our injectable formulation of N-acetylcysteine ("NAC") for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. NAC is accepted worldwide as the standard of care for acetaminophen overdose. Our competitors in the acetaminophen overdose market are those companies selling orally administered NAC including, but not limited to, Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bedford Laboratories division of Hikma Pharmaceuticals, Roxane Laboratories, Inc., InnoPharma Inc. and Hospira Inc.
In November 2012, InnoPharma Inc. was granted approval by the FDA to distribute their generic form of the old formulation of Acetadote containing EDTA. In late 2012, we entered into the Settlement Agreement with Paddock and Perrigo that included the right to distribute our Authorized Generic Acetadote injection product. Our branded Acetadote now competes with both the EDTA free Authorized Generic Acetadote distributed by Paddock and Perrigo along with generic Acetadote products that contain EDTA. 
Manufactures of the old Acetadote formulation include: Akorn, AuroMedics Pharma, Fresenius Kabi and Sagent Pharmaceuticals. 
Caldolor®
Caldolor is marketed for the treatment of pain and fever, primarily in a hospital or surgery center setting. A variety of other products address the acute pain market:
•Morphine, the most commonly used product for the treatment of acute, post-operative pain, is manufactured and distributed by several generic pharmaceutical companies;
•Other generic injectable opioids, including fentanyl, meperidine and hydromorphone, address this market;
•Ketorolac tromethamine (brand name Toradol®), an injectable NSAID, is also manufactured and distributed by several generic pharmaceutical companies;
•IV acetaminophen (brand name Ofirmev®), an injectable analgesic product is sold by Mallinckrodt plc, and there are also generic versions from different manufacturers available;
•Bupivacaine injectable suspension (brand name Exparel®), product sold by Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., two additional bupivacaine products, Xaracoll and Posimir, were recently approved; and
•IV meloxicam (brand name Anjeso™), a once a day injectable COX-2 preferential NSAID manufactured by Baudax Bio which was recently approved by the FDA.
We are aware of other product candidates in development to treat acute pain including injectable NSAIDs, novel opioids, new formulations of existing therapies and extended release anesthetics. We believe non-narcotic analgesics for the treatment of post-surgical pain are the primary potential competitors to Caldolor.
In addition to the injectable analgesic products above, many companies are developing analgesics for specific indications such as migraine and neuropathic pain, oral extended-release forms of existing narcotic and non-narcotic products, and products with new methods of delivery such as transdermal. We are not aware of any approved injectable products indicated for the treatment of fever in the U.S. other than Caldolor and Ofirmev. 
There are, however, numerous drugs available to physicians to reduce fevers in hospital settings via oral administration to the patient, including ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and aspirin. These drugs are manufactured by numerous pharmaceutical companies.
Kristalose®
Kristalose is a dry powder crystalline prescription formulation of lactulose indicated for the treatment of constipation. The U.S. constipation therapy market includes various prescription and over the counter, or OTC, products. The branded prescription products which we believe are our primary competitors are:
•Lubiproston (brand name Amitiza®), an oral product indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in adults, is manufactured and sold by Mallinckrodt  Pharmaceuticals.
•Naloxegol (brand name Movantik®), an oral product indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in adults with chronic non-cancer pain and recently acquired by RedHill Biopharma in the first quarter of 2020. 
•Linaclotide (brand name Linzess®), an oral product indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation. It is sold by Allergan, Inc. and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
•Plecanatide (brand name Trulance®), an oral product indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation. It is sold by Synergy Pharmaceuticals.
•Generic and branded liquid lactulose products are marketed by a number of pharmaceutical companies.
•Lactitol for oral solution (brand name Pizensy), an oral, osmotic laxative indicated  for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and distributed by Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  was recently approved by the FDA.
There are several hundred OTC products used to treat constipation marketed by numerous pharmaceutical and consumer health companies. MiraLax (polyethylene glycol 3350), previously a prescription product, was indicated for the treatment of constipation and manufactured and marketed by Bayer. MiraLax was converted to an OTC 
product in February 2007 and recently, the FDA rescinded the approval of the generic prescription polyethylene glycol 3350 products.
Omeclamox®-Pak
Omeclamox-Pak is a branded prescription product used for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and duodenal ulcer disease. It combines three well-known and widely prescribed medications packaged in a daily dose pack for patient convenience: omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. The three individual components of Omeclamox-Pak are also available from other suppliers through three separate prescriptions. 
While there are several competitor products, Omeclamox-Pak is one of the two actively marketed products for this condition. In addition, compared to the competing products, Omeclamox-Pak has the lowest pill burden, fewest days of therapy and convenient twice daily dosing. The prescription combination products, indicated for treatment of H. pylori, which we believe are our primary competitors are:
•PrevPac®, an oral product sold by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. There are also approved generic versions of PrevPac;
•Pylera®, an oral product manufactured and sold by Allergan plc; and
•Talicia®, an oral product manufactured by RedHill Biopharma which was recently approved by the FDA.
Vaprisol®
Vaprisol is a patented, prescription brand indicated to raise serum sodium levels in hospitalized patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The product was developed and registered by Astellas and then launched in 2006. It is one of two branded prescription products indicated for the treatment of hyponatremia, and the first and only intravenously administered branded treatment. The other competing product is Samsca, an oral product sold by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company.
Vibativ®
Effective November 12, 2018, Cumberland acquired the worldwide rights to Vibativ (telavancin) from Theravance Biopharma. 
Vibativ is a potent, once-daily, injectable antibiotic for the treatment of certain gram-positive infections. Vibativ is approved for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections and hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia caused by susceptible isolates of Staphylococcus aureus when alternative treatments are not suitable. There are several generic and branded antibiotics that compete for these indications. 
The major generic competitors are vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin. Vancomycin is by far the most widely used agent. Newer branded agents are also available including:
•Ceftaroline fosamil (brand name Teflaro® ) an injectable antibiotic manufactured and sold by Allergan
•Dalbavancin (brand name Dalvance® ), an injectable antibiotic manufactured and sold by Allergan
•Oritavancin (brand name Orbactiv® ), an injectable antibiotic manufactured and sold by Melinta
We are aware of a number of other novel antibiotics which are currently in development. 
Antibiotic drug selection is based both on an empiric and susceptibility proven basis. In the hospital setting, cost is an important factor which favors the use of generic agents as long as they are effective. Newer agents are often reserved for two reasons: they are valuable in the treatment of patients that fail to respond to generics and it is considered good practice to conserve the use of these agents to reduce the risk of resistance. 
RediTrex®
RediTrex was introduced by Cumberland in the fourth quarter of 2020. RediTrex is methotrexate for subcutaneous administration in a unique syringe designed for ease of use, improved accuracy, and enhanced safety. It is indicated for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and severe, recalcitrant, or disabling psoriasis unresponsive to alternative treatments.
This market is highly competitive with drugs from several different therapeutic classes available for treatment. Methotrexate is considered a standard of care especially when patients fail to respond adequately to low dose steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Methotrexate is available in multiple dose forms including oral, subcutaneous, and intra-venous. Methotrexate may be used alone or in combination with drugs from other therapeutic classes to adequately control patient symptoms.
RediTrex competes with other dose forms and delivery systems for methotrexate including, oral tablets, conventional vial and syringe administration, and auto-injector pens. Oral tablets and conventional vials are generic and available from many suppliers. There are two auto-injector pen products available, Rasuvo and Otrexup. 
RediTrex also competes with or may be used in combination with drugs from other therapeutic classes including, injectable biologics like Humira and Enbrel and oral JAK inhibitors like Xaljanz. These newer agents are more expensive than the methotrexate products but benefit from significant promotion to patients and doctors. 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
The development of new pharmaceutical products can be a long, expensive and risky process. There is no assurance we will obtain successful study results or secure the needed market approvals for our pipeline product candidates. Governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products. In the U.S., the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, ("FDCA"), the Public Health Service Act, and other federal statutes and regulations, subjects pharmaceutical products to rigorous review. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending New Drug Application ("NDAs") or biologics license applications, ("BLAs"), warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
We, our manufacturers and contract research organizations may also be subject to regulations under other federal, state and local laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, (OSHA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act and import, export and customs regulations as well as the laws and regulations of other countries.
FDA Approval Process
The FDA is a regulatory agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. A key responsibility is to regulate the safety and effectiveness of drugs sold in the United States. The FDA manages this responsibility into two phases: pre-approval (premarket) and post approval (post market). The FDA reviews manufacturers' applications to market drugs in the United States; a drug may not be sold unless it has FDA approval. The FDA continues its oversight of drug safety and effectiveness as long as the drug is on the market.
To market a prescription drug in the United States, a manufacturer needs FDA approval. To get that approval, the manufacturer must demonstrate the drug's safety and effectiveness according to criteria specified in law and agency regulations, ensure that its manufacturing plant passes FDA inspection, and obtain FDA approval for the drug's labeling, a term that includes all written material about the drug, including, for example, packaging, prescribing information for physicians and patient brochures.
The progression to drug approval begins before FDA involvement. First, scientists work in the laboratory to discover and develop a new compound. Next, basic questions on safety are answered by nonclinical testing with 
animals and then, a drug or biotechnology company develops a prototype drug. That company must seek clearance from the FDA by way of an Investigational New Drug ("IND") application to test the product with human subjects. 
Those tests, called clinical trials, are carried out sequentially in Phase I, II, and III studies, which involve increasing numbers of subjects. The manufacturer then compiles the resulting data and analyses in an NDA. The FDA reviews the NDA with three major concerns: (1) safety and effectiveness in the drug's proposed use; (2) appropriateness of the proposed labeling; and (3) adequacy of manufacturing methods to assure the drug's identity, strength, quality, and purity.
The FDCA and associated regulations detail the requirements at each step. The FDA uses a few special mechanisms to expedite drug development and the review process when a drug might address an unmet need or a serious disease or condition. Those mechanisms include accelerated approval, fast track and priority reviews and the newer designation, breakthrough therapy.
The sponsor of the drug typically conducts human clinical trials in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase I clinical trials are generally conducted in a small number of healthy volunteers, primarily to collect and assess pharmacokinetics and safety data at one or more dosages prior to proceeding into patients. 
In Phase II clinical trials, the sponsor evaluates the early efficacy of the product in short term trials on the targeted indication and identifies possible adverse effects and safety risks in a patient population. 
Phase III clinical trials typically involve testing for patients in long term trials examining safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at geographically-dispersed test sites.
The FDA requires that clinical trials be conducted in accordance with the FDA's Good Clinical Practice GCP requirements. The FDA may order the partial, temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The institutional review board ("IRB"), or ethics committee (outside of the U.S.), of each clinical site generally must approve the clinical trial design and patient informed consent and may also require the clinical trial at that site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions.
The results of the nonclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacturing and composition of the product and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA for marketing approval. The NDA undergoes a 60-day validation review period before it is accepted for filing. 
If the NDA is found to be incomplete, it will not be accepted. Once the NDA is validated and accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. 
Under policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA (currently PDUFA VI - effective October 1, 2017), the FDA has a target timeline of 10 months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by two months to address deficiencies, or by three months if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time during the review clock period. If the FDA's evaluations of the NDA and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable and meet all regulations, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Priority review is reserved for drugs that represent a “significant improvement in safety or efficacy” over existing treatments and FDA endeavors to complete these reviews in six months.
If the NDA meets with FDA approval, a letter will be sent out indicating approval and final labeling recommendations. If not, a complete response letter will be sent to applicants indicating that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. 
The complete response letter will describe the specific deficiencies that the agency has identified in an application and what changes must be made before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding whether the application will ultimately be approved. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for the proposed indication(s) under study. FDA reported that NDAs showed a steadier increase with the 
percentage of first-cycle approval letters for new molecular entities rising from 56% for FY 2009 applications to 89% for FY 2018 applications. 
The time and cost of completing these steps and obtaining FDA approval can vary dramatically depending on the drug. However, to complete these steps for a novel drug can take many years and cost millions of dollars.
Section 505(b) New Drug Applications
An NDA may be submitted under different methods, a 505(b)(1), 505(b)(2) or 505(j). Section 505(b) provides for the submission of an NDA to support the approval of a drug. Upon approval, a drug may be marketed only for the FDA-approved indication(s) in the approved dosage form. Further clinical trials may be necessary to gain approval for the use of the product for any additional indications or dosage forms. 
The FDA also requires post market safety surveillance reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug, which may result in withdrawal of approval after marketing begins if significant adverse safety findings are found.
Section 505(b)(1) or the 'full' NDA is used for new chemical entities ("NCEs") and requires full clinical and nonclinical development of a compound. Marketing exclusivity assigned to a 505(b)(1) approval is five years. A 505(b)(2) NDA permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant using previously reported safety and efficacy data, and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Generally new studies are required to provide data on the proposed change. 
Some examples of products that may be allowed to follow a 505(b)(2) path to approval are drugs which have a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication or combination drugs. Marketing exclusivity for a 505(b)(2) submission is three years. 
Both 505 (b)(1) and (b)(2) are eligible for seven years of exclusivity for orphan drugs and/or six months for pediatric exclusivity. Any marketing exclusivity is independent of patent exclusivity. We successfully secured FDA approvals for Acetadote in January 2004, for Caldolor in June 2009 and for RediTrex in 2019 pursuant to the 505(b)(2) pathway. 
Orphan drug designation
The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 (the "Orphan Drug Act") encourages manufacturers to seek approval of products intended to treat “rare diseases and conditions” with a prevalence of fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S. or for which there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the development costs for the product. For products that receive orphan drug designation by the FDA, the Orphan Drug Act provides tax credits for clinical research, FDA assistance with protocol design, eligibility for FDA grants to fund clinical studies, waiver of the FDA application fee, and a period of seven years of marketing exclusivity for the product following FDA marketing approval. 
Acetadote received Orphan Drug designation in October 2001 and in 2004 the FDA approved the product to prevent or lessen hepatic injury after ingestion of a potentially hepatotoxic quantity of acetaminophen. Acetadote was entitled to marketing exclusivity until January 2011 for the treatment of this approved indication.
Section 505(j) abbreviated new drug applications
An ANDA is a type of NDA where approval of a generic drug is based on demonstrating comparability to an innovator drug product (the RLD or Reference Listed Drug). Applications are "abbreviated" because they generally don't include preclinical and clinical data to establish safety and effectiveness. Generics must demonstrate that the product is bioequivalent (i.e., performs in the same manner and is comparable to the 'innovator' product in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics and intended use). 
Abbreviated applications may be submitted for drug products that are the same as a listed drug and must be identical in active ingredient(s), form, strength, route of administration, and identical in conditions of use (non-exclusive uses). Products are declared suitable based on a suitability petition to the FDA. If the petition is approved, the Sponsor may then submit the ANDA.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, informally known as the "Hatch-Waxman Act", is a 1984 United States federal law which established the modern system of generic drugs. 
Hatch-Waxman amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Section 505(j) 21 U.S.C. 355(j) sets forth the process by which would-be marketers of generic drugs can file ANDAs to seek FDA approval of the generic. Section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV), the so-called Paragraph IV, allows 180-day exclusivity to companies that are the "first-to-file" an ANDA against holders of patents for branded counterparts.
These Hatch-Waxman amendments grant generic manufacturers the ability to mount a validity challenge without incurring the cost of entry or risking enormous damages flowing from any possible infringement. Hatch-Waxman essentially redistributes the relative risk assessments and explains the flow of settlement funds and their magnitude. Hatch-Waxman gives generics considerable leverage in patent litigation.
Health care legislation
On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA. On March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or HCERA, was enacted into law, which modified the revenue provisions of the PPACA. The PPACA as amended by the HCERA constitutes the healthcare reform legislation. The following highlights certain provisions of the legislation that may affect us.
Pharmaceutical Industry Fee: Beginning in calendar-year 2011, an annual fee was imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs (e.g., Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs programs, Department of Defense programs and TRICARE). 
The annual fee is allocated to companies based on their previous calendar-year market share using sales data that the government agencies that purchase the pharmaceuticals will provide to the Treasury Department. Although we participate in governmental programs that subject us to this fee, our sales volume in such programs is less than $10 million, with the first $5 million of sales being exempt from the fee. This fee has not had a material impact and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations.
Physician Payments Sunshine Act: The PPACA also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, for aggregation and subsequent public disclosure. Under the Sunshine Act, beginning August 1, 2013, we have collected data regarding reportable transfers of value and have reported such data to CMS. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. In addition to the Federal Sunshine Act, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals.
Medicaid Rebate Rate: We currently provide rebates for products sold to Medicaid beneficiaries.
Product Serialization: In November of 2013, the FDA passed the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). The DSCSA was created to strengthen the security of the drug distribution supply chain by adding controls such as a national pharmaceutical track and trace system and establishing national standards for licensing of prescription drug wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers. DSCSA requires trading partners, including manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors and dispensers to provide transaction information to subsequent purchasers for certain prescription drugs. We have taken necessary steps to implement this program and are in compliance with all requirements by the November 2018 deadline.
21st Century Cures Act: The 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), signed into law on December 13, 2016, is designed to help accelerate medical product development and bring new innovations and advances to patients who need them faster and more efficiently. The law builds on FDA's ongoing work to incorporate the perspectives of patients into the development of drugs, biological products, and devices in FDA's decision-making process. The 
Cures Act enhances FDA's ability to modernize clinical trial designs and clinical outcome assessments, which will speed the development and review of novel medical products, including medical countermeasures.
Specifically, the Cures Act enables us to work with FDA in the development of new biomarkers, clinical outcome assessments, surrogate endpoints, and patient reported outcomes. It allows for the use of data summaries rather than full clinical trials for approval and the use of real world evidence to support approval of new indications of approved medical products, or to help satisfy post-approval study requirements for marketed products.
Post Approval Activities
Once a drug is on the U.S. market (following FDA approval of the NDA), the FDA continues to address drug production, distribution, and use. FDA activities are based on ensuring drug safety and effectiveness, and address product integrity, labeling, reporting of research and adverse events, surveillance, drug studies, risk management, information dissemination, off-label use, physician advertising and direct-to-consumer advertising.
If we amend the NDA for an FDA approved product, such as adding safety or efficacy labeling claims, promoting those new claims, making certain manufacturing changes or product enhancements, we will need FDA review and approval before the change can be implemented. While physicians may use products for indications that have not been approved by the FDA, we may not label or promote the product for an indication that has not been approved. 
Securing FDA approval for new indications, product enhancements, and manufacturing and labeling changes may require us to conduct additional clinical trials under FDA's IND regulations. Even if such studies are conducted, they are still subject to the same requirements and timelines as an original NDA.
The FDA continuously gathers information about possible adverse reactions to the products it has approved for use. The FDA requires all manufacturers to report adverse events. It also provides a procedure for consumers and physicians to voluntarily report their concerns about drugs. The agency collects those reports through MedWatch and uses its FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to store and analyze them. Because some events may occur after the use of a drug for reasons unrelated to the product, the FDA reviews the events to assess which ones may indicate a problem with that particular drug. 
They then use information gleaned from the surveillance data to determine a course of action. They might recommend a change in drug labeling to alert users to a potential problem, or, perhaps, to require the manufacturer to study the observed association between the drug and the adverse event.
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. 
The federal health care program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed health care programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.
Federal False Claims Act
The Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. 
A number of pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product.
ICH - International Committee on Harmonization
Outside of the U.S., our ability to market our products will depend on receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The International Committee on Harmonization (ICH) provides a set of standards that most Regulatory Authorities adhere to (e.g. U.S., Europe, and Japan) allowing greater harmonization in the interpretation and application of technical guidelines and requirements for pharmaceutical product registration, thereby reducing or obviating duplication of testing carried out during the research and development of new human medicines. Regulatory harmonization offers many direct benefits to both regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry with beneficial impact for the protection of public health.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and we believe that our operations comply with such regulations. We anticipate that the effects of compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment will not have any material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 
SEASONALITY
There are no significant seasonal aspects to our business.
BACKLOG
Due to the relatively short lead-time required to fill orders for our products, backlog of orders is not considered material to our business.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2020, we had 90 employees. We believe that our future will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel, including hospital and field sales personnel in particular.
SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
We make statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statement of historical facts may be forward-looking statements. In particular, forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations, and can be identified by the use of terminology such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “should,” “seek,” “anticipate” and other comparable terms or the negative thereof. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward-looking oral and written public statements concerning our expected future operations and other developments. While forward-looking statements reflect our good-faith beliefs and best judgment based upon current information, they are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from the expectations contained in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to:
•The possible or assumed future results of operations, including the accuracy of our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues, capital requirements and needs for additional financing; 
•Changes in national or regional economic conditions, including changes in interest rates and the availability and the cost of capital to us;
•The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the duration and any recurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and scope of related government orders and restrictions, the impact on our employees, and the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on overall demand for our key products; 
•The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our suppliers, including any disruptions and inefficiencies in the supply chain for our products; 
•Our competitive position and competitors, including the size and growth potential of the markets for our products and product candidates;
•The success, cost and timing of our product acquisition and development activities and clinical trials; and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates;
•Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the FDA (or international counterparts) or declining sales;
•The performance of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers which impacts our supply chain and could create business shutdowns or product shortages; and the retention of key scientific and management personnel;
•Challenges to our patents and the introduction of generic versions of our products and product candidates, which could negatively impact our ability to commercialize and sell our products and product candidates and decrease sales a result of market exclusivity;
•Changes in reimbursement available to us, including changes in Medicare and Medicaid payment levels and availability of third-party insurance coverage and the effects of future legislation or regulations, including changes to regulatory approval of new products, licensing and patent rights, environmental protection and possible drug re-importation legislation;
•Interruptions and breaches of our computer and communications systems, and those of our vendors, including computer viruses, hacking and cyber-attacks, that could impair our ability to conduct business and communicate internally and with our customers, or result in the theft of trade secrets or 
other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise privacy of sensitive information belonging to us, our customers or other business partners; and 
•Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The list above contains many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.
