Organizational History of the Company and Business Overview

Healthcare Solutions Management Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and successor in interest to Verity Delaware Inc., a Delaware corporation which was previously a Nevada corporation named Verity Corp. was incorporated on April 11, 2006 in the state of Nevada under the name Infrared Systems, International.

On December 31, 2012, AquaLiv Technologies, Inc. (“ALTI”) and Verity Farms II, Inc. (“Verity Farms”), a South Dakota corporation, entered into a Share Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, ALTI acquired 100% of the authorized and issued shares of Verity Farms in exchange (the “Exchange”) for 4,850,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 of ALTI, representing approximately 86% of the outstanding shares of ALTI, on a fully diluted basis, assuming conversion into common stock. As a result of the Exchange and the other transactions contemplated thereunder, Verity Farms became a wholly owned subsidiary of ALTI and ALTI acquired Verity Farms’ business operations. ALTI was formed under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 11, 2006 originally under the name of Infrared Systems International “ISI” as a wholly owned subsidiary of China Sxan Biotech, Inc. (“CSBI”) (then known as Advance Technologies, Inc.) to pursue a narrowly defined business objective called infrared security systems.

On April 1, 2013, the Company changed its name from AquaLiv Technologies Inc. to Verity Corp. and our stock symbol changed to VRTY. The Company was the parent of Verity Farms and Aistiva Corporation (“Aistiva”) (f/k/a AquaLiv, Inc.). Verity Farms was dedicated to providing consumers with safe, high-quality, and nutritious food sources through sustainable crop and livestock production. Aistiva previously released products in the industries of water treatment, skincare, and agriculture. Verity Farms was administratively dissolved in the State of South Dakota on May 4, 2018. Aistiva was administratively dissolved on April 9, 2015, in the State of Washington.

In February 2016, all of the Company’s officers and directors resigned, and the Company stopped substantially all operating activities. At such time, the Company became a “shell company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.

On November 5, 2020, we changed our Fiscal Year End from June 30 to September 30. As a result of this change, we filed a Transition Report on Form 10-K with the SEC for the three-month transition period from June 30, 2020 to September 30, 2020 on January 20, 2021.

As a result of the consummation of the Merger, as such term is defined below, on April 15, 2021, Healthcare Solutions Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“HSH”), became our wholly owned subsidiary and the business of HSH became the business of the Company going forward. Accordingly, the Company ceased to be a shell company as of April 15, 2021. 

Merger with Healthcare Solutions Holdings, Inc.

On June 14, 2019, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) by and between the Company, Verity Merger Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and a Delaware corporation (the “Merger Sub”), and Healthcare Solutions Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“HSH”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the parties agreed that Merger Sub would merge with and into HSH, with HSH being the surviving entity and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). The Merger closed on April 15, 2021 (the “Closing”), at which time Merger Sub merged with and into HSH with HSH being the surviving entity, and HSH became our wholly owned subsidiary. As a result of the consummation of the Merger, HSH became our wholly owned subsidiary and the business of HSH became the business of the Company going forward.

At the Closing of the Merger, Robert Stevens (the “Receiver”) appointed new officers and directors of the Company. As consideration for the services of the Receiver and his team, for acting as the court-appointed receiver for the Company and its predecessor and affiliated entities, and pursuant the Merger Agreement, as amended, in August of 2020, the Receiver and certain entities, as directed by the Receiver, were issued an aggregate total of 114,599,754 pre-reverse split shares of the Company’s common stock. At Closing, the aggregate Merger consideration paid to the holders of the HSH common was 1,145,997,555 pre-reverse split shares of the Company’s common stock constituting 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company common stock immediately following the Closing.

As a result of the consummation of the Merger, on April 15, 2021, HSH became our wholly owned subsidiary and the business of HSH became the business of the Company going forward. Accordingly, at the Closing, the Company ceased to be a shell company as of April 15, 2021.

In connection with the Merger, the Company appointed new officers and directors as described below.

Prior Receivership

The Company was previously in receivership. On May 16, 2016, pursuant to Case Number A16-733815-B, Nevada’s 8th Judicial District, Business Court, appointed Robert Stevens as receiver (the “Receiver”) for the Company. Creditors of the Company were required to provide claims in writing under oath on or before November 3, 2016, or they would be barred under Nevada Revised Statute §78.675. Since May 16, 2016, through the date of the Merger, the Company was operating under the direction of the Receiver. On March 5, 2018, the District Court in Clark County, Nevada approved a plan of reorganization for the Company and the discharge of the Receiver upon completion of his duties under the court order. Upon the Closing of the Merger, the reorganization of the Company described in the court order was completed and, as a result and pursuant to the court order dated March 5, 2018, the Receiver was automatically discharged and the receivership was automatically terminated such that no further action was needed by the Receiver or the Company in connection with the receivership, and such that Company was no longer in receivership.

Impact of COVID-19

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic which continued to spread throughout the U.S. and the globe. In addition to the devastating effects on human life, the pandemic is continuing to have a negative ripple effect on the global economy, leading to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets. There are no comparable events that provide guidance as to the effect the COVID-19 pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate effect of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. COVID-19 has already hindered or slowed many of HSH’s businesses, including but not limited to our growth and growth strategies, developments in the marketplace for products, therapies and services, financial results, research and development strategy, regulatory approvals, and competitive strengths. The direct or indirect impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition, continues today, but HSH has thus far weathered the pandemic storm and continues to seek to improve our level of service and patient care. The extent of the ultimate impact of the pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance will depend on various developments, including the duration and continued spread of the outbreak, which cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. Accordingly, while management reasonably expects the COVID-19 outbreak to negatively impact the Company, the related consequences and duration are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.

Overview of Our Business Operations 

We operate through our wholly owned subsidiary HSH. HSH is an integrated healthcare company which strives to provide vital services and a high-quality of care for patients over the course of their lifetime. HSH was organized with the goal of becoming an advanced, national healthcare system in the United States, providing clinicians with state-of-the-art diagnostic and therapeutic tools, and providing patients with greater access to a higher level of care in local communities that we believe have historically been underserved by the medical industry. HSH currently conducts its operations directly through HSH, and also through its wholly owned subsidiaries within the medical industry, seeking to serve the needs of patients’ and physicians alike.

HSH currently has the following wholly owned operating subsidiaries in the state of Delaware through which it operates its business:


· | Advance Care Medical Holdings, Inc. is a Delaware, corporation (“ACM”) which seeks to offer a host of comprehensive care service directly to patients; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | HSH Surgical, Inc. is a Delaware, corporation (“HSHS”) which seeks to own and operate Ambulatory Surgery Centers; and 
· | HSH Medical Services, Inc. (“HSHMS”) is a Delaware, corporation which seeks to provide ancillary services directly to physician offices and engage in sales and marketing of medical products to doctors.


6


To date, the majority of HSH’s revenues have been generated through resales and marketing of medical products which HSH has done directly at the HSH level using the trade name HSHMS. HSH has formed HSHMS in the state of Delaware, and it plans to conduct all such resale and marketing activities through HSHMS. HSH has also generated revenues through providing consulting services to Managed Service Organizations (“MSOs”).

The Company has recently sought to expand its business and service offering capabilities and has shifted its focus away from medical product sales towards providing services to patients through its planned surgical and urgent care and internal medicine health facilities which it plans to conduct through ACM and HSHS. The Company expects that, going forward, revenues from its ownership interests in these facilities will comprise the majority of the Company’s revenues as the Company focuses more on those areas and less on medical products. The specific products and/or services intended to be provided by each of HSH’s operating subsidiaries are described in detail below.

HSH has provided consulting services to Managed Service Organizations (“MSOs”) and as further described below, HSH plans to establish another wholly-owned operating subsidiary to provide MSOs with both business management, development, and operational assistance. Additionally, HSH intends to become a comprehensive medical incubator and innovation center, dedicated to accelerating development, building businesses, and improving patient outcomes

ACM plans to set up comprehensive care services that aim to combine both internal medicine practices with urgent care at numerous locations.

HSH Surgical, Inc.

HSH’s wholly owned subsidiary HSH Surgical, Inc., (HSHS) is a Delaware corporation. HSHS is a physician-centric development and management company of multi-specialty, cardiology focused, ambulatory surgery centers. HSHS seeks to strive to become an industry-leading ambulatory surgery center (“ASC”) management and development company focused on partnering with physicians and employees to create an outstanding patient experience. HSHS seeks to partner with physicians to develop, design, build, credential, and then manage ASCs for, and with, their physician partners. HSHS also seeks to work with physicians in a joint-venture relationship with local hospitals or health systems, if we determine that such a relationship is in the best interest of the physicians and the ASC. 

We believe that physician partners are the lifeline of any ASC, and they should retain control of the facility while HSHS can focus on adding value by managing the business side while allowing the physician partners to focus on patient care. As such, it is planned, that HSHS, will provide 30% of the funding for an initial ASC project, and the physicians will provide 70%, resulting in HSHS being a minority 30% owner of each ASC that it will manage and develops in partnership with physicians. It is planned that HSHS will only seek to partner with top-quality, board-certified surgeons to provide the surgical services at these ASC facilities.

HSHS also aims to be a direct provider of ambulatory surgery services, and all of the ambulatory and surgery business of HSH are run through this subsidiary. Our planned ASCs are comprised of a network offering multidisciplinary options. As discussed in detail above, on November 26, 2021, the Company and HSH and HSH’s wholly owned subsidiary HSH Surgical, Inc. (“HSHS”) entered into an Ambulatory Surgery Center Development Agreement with Jameson, LLC DBA American Development Partners, a Tennessee limited liability company. It is planned that our state-of-the-art facilities will provide same day out-patient surgical care including both diagnostic and preventative procedures.

The products and services are typically installed by the different vendors and serviced as required by the manufacturer(s). If these products and services require physical operation, HSH recruits the appropriate personnel to do so.

· | Liaison between medical office administrators and service providers. 


A core focus of HSH’s MSO practice will be to provide consultation on the development and management of 100% MSO owned services in the ancillary space and provide operational support for them.

An MSO can be a gateway for providers to apply a population health lens to their practice or network with a focus on quality and outcomes, ultimately enabling the practice to better control overall the total cost of care. MSOs, administrative services organizations (ASOs), care management organizations (CMOs), population health services organizations (PHSOs) and the functions they provide, come in many shapes and sizes. The governance structure and functionality of an MSO is unique to the health system, independent practice association (IPA), ACO or health plan it is designed to serve. A provider taking risk can design or outsource an MSO for a single function/service or many functions/services depending on their needs. Many health systems are balancing the MSO type needs of a wholly owned or joint venture health plan, one or more ACOs and one or more IPAs. As a result, health systems and provider organizations are grappling with decisions about which functions they can realistically provide and how they can organize themselves to deliver these functions in a cost-effective way that allows them to capture and effectively manage as much of the premium dollar as possible.

HSH intends to work in collaboration with clients to help them understand the value of MSO infrastructure as they consider opportunities to manage risk, improve financial and clinical performance and meet the needs of all members. We plan that our subsidiaries will help clients to understand the scope of MSO service and capabilities, assess existing MSO services and capabilities and recommend solutions to optimize performance, align with market drivers, and achieve both short and long-term member management goals. We also intend to assist providers to establish their own MSO entities, including build/buy decision support, to help best control and manage risk. We will custom tailor consulting fee arrangements to the economic capabilities of our clients with both hourly payment charge options, total gross project billing, or monthly and annual retainer services. 

Healthcare Incubator & Accelerator

HSH intends to be a comprehensive medical incubator and innovation center, with a team dedicated to accelerating development, building businesses, and improving patient outcomes. HSH’s team to date has worked with clinician innovators, university tech transfer offices, and academic researchers to design, engineer, prototype, and facilitate commercialization of a broad range of innovative medical products and companies.

HSH’s core management team of physicians, clinicians, and M&A subject matter experts are intended to collaborate closely with new product development teams, MedTech entrepreneurs, and medical providers seeking to accelerate time to market while reducing costs.

HSH plans to work to diligently to identify High Growth Healthcare Companies (HGHCs) that are candidates for the public market. In this capacity, we seek to:


· | Leverage HSH’s relationships, assets, and experience to develop HGHCs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Grow HGHCs by utilizing banking relationships to facilitate acquisitions.
· | Assist to and launch HGHCs to public markets. 


We intend to perform these operations at the HSH level, and believe that our expertise in this field will prove valuable in our ability to identify and assist promising companies in this space.

Suppliers

HSH, works with suppliers and manufacturing companies on a reseller basis. HSH utilizes its physician network to review, vet-out, and help implement new diagnostic and therapeutic treatments and devices in other physician offices. HSH is compensated by its suppliers and manufactures for the products and services that are resold through the HSH network. HSH has formed HSHMS to conduct these operations in the future.

For ACM and HSHS, “supply” will be in the form of quality medical physicians and healthcare workers that we recruit from various sources.

HSH is not materially reliant on any one supplier for its products or service offerings.

Sales and Marketing

HSH utilizes third-party marketing agencies for its sales and marketing activities.

On October 6, 2020, HSH entered into a Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”) with GrowthMed, Inc., a California corporation (“GrowthMed”). Pursuant to the MSA, GrowthMed agreed to provide HSH with custom responsive design and initial website setup and creation services as well as maintenance services for same, webhosting, advertising, email hosting and other related services (referred to herein as the “Services”).

The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.9 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

HSH believes that Hearst Media Services can help raise the Company’s profile and create increased awareness and greater visibility of HSH in the medical industry.

Competition

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition from a number of companies. Our primary competitors are HCA Healthcare, Texas Health Resources, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Tenet, DaVita and VCA. HSH is seeking to create a paradigm shift in the healthcare industry by creating a new form of national healthcare complex that is highly efficient, provides greater access for all patients and drives superior patient outcomes. We believe that this paradigm shift will improve the financial sustainability of the American healthcare system and lead to a higher quality of care.

However, many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, and other resources and name recognition than we do and more established distribution networks and relationships with healthcare providers. As a result, many of these companies may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and standards and changes in customer requirements. These companies may be able to invest more resources in research and development, strategic acquisitions, sales and marketing, patent prosecution, litigation, and financing capital equipment acquisitions for their customers.

Industry Overview

HSH operates in the healthcare industry and seeks to implement and operate innovative health care models to create a patient-centered, physician-centric experience.

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook dated as of September 1, 2020, employment in healthcare occupations is projected to grow 15% from 2019 to 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations, adding about 2.4 million new jobs. Healthcare occupations are projected to add more jobs than any of the other occupational groups. This projected growth is mainly due to an aging population, leading to greater demand for healthcare services.

According to a report titled “Ambulatory Surgery Centers Market by Product, By Component, By Specialty Type, and By Geography - Global Drivers, Restraints, Opportunities, Trends, and Forecast up to 2026” released by Research and Markets dated November 29, 2020, the estimated market value of Ambulatory Surgery Centers in 2020 was $1.89 billion.

Ambulatory Surgery Centers are transforming healthcare delivery as well as the market for medical devices and equipment. By focusing on routine, lower-risk procedures in a more convenient setting, ASCs can offer surgical procedures at rates 35% to 50% lower than hospitals, according to a September 2019 report published by Bain & Company.

The Urgent Care Association released its 2019 benchmarking report that showed the total number of centers had reached 9,616 as of November 2019, a 9.6% jump from the previous year. The number of Urgent Care Centers has increased steadily each year from 2013, when the total number of Urgent Care Centers was 6,100. Both Urgent Care Centers and Retail Clinics have continued to grow across the US as patients look for convenience and affordability, creating competition with traditional hospital and physician practice services.

Factors which are driving the market growth of Ambulatory Surgical Centers are an increase in the number of surgeries, a rise in the incidence of chronic diseases, and growth in the geriatric population. In addition to the above-mentioned factors, the advancements in technology, and surging demand for minimally invasive surgeries are fueling the growth of the Ambulatory Surgical Center market. The ASCs are more economical as compared to the hospitals and nursing homes as they help patients with instant medical services and quick discharge facilities.

There is a demand to reduce increasing healthcare costs and move from inpatient to outpatient surgical procedures. The rising need of IT solutions such as Telehealth, and Remote Monitoring of the patient for better management creates the market opportunity for Ambulatory Surgical Centers vendors to fulfill both the residential as well as commercial demand.

The rising number of diseases and demand for outpatient surgery has heightened the growth of the Ambulatory Surgical Centers. The ASCs are more economical as compared to the hospitals and nursing homes as they help patients with instant medical services and quick discharge facilities. Further, the vendors of Ambulatory Surgical Centers are spending huge capital in acquiring companies in order to develop innovative and technologically advanced Ambulatory Surgical Centers that can offer surgical treatment for various diseases.

The growing rate of old age population and high occurrence of chronic diseases, gastrointestinal, diabetes resulting in eye related diseases, musculoskeletal and other diseases are the major drivers behind the opening of the technologically advanced Ambulatory Surgery Centers equipped with improved pain operating methods in the United States. The US ASC market is expected to grow at a remarkable pace in future. The demand for highly advanced ambulatory surgical centers is getting stronger all across the United States on the account of positive government initiatives to develop advanced healthcare infrastructure which is further offering opportunities for various ambulatory surgical center companies to expand their presence in the United States.

Governmental Regulation

Significant Federal and State Healthcare Laws Governing Our Business

As a healthcare company, we are subject to various laws and regulations governing our business. For example, all of our comprehensive care locations need to be licensed with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and state medical boards along with all of the physicians and nurse practitioners that are providing the medical care. All Ambulatory Surgery Centers must also go through a complex licensing procedure with the state in which they are located as well as all of the medical staff at each location.

Our operations and relationships with healthcare providers such as doctors, MSOs, hospitals, other healthcare facilities, and healthcare professionals are subject to extensive and increasing regulation by numerous federal, state, and local government entities. These laws and regulations often are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, and various state authorities. We have included brief descriptions of some, but not all, of the laws and regulations that affect our business below.

Imposition of liabilities associated with a violation of any of these healthcare laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company cannot guarantee that its arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to violate certain healthcare laws. Government investigations and prosecutions, even if we are ultimately found to be without fault, can be costly and disruptive to our business. Moreover, changes in healthcare legislation or government regulation may restrict our existing operations, limit the expansion of our business, or impose additional compliance requirements and costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

False Claims Acts

The federal False Claims Act imposes civil liability on individuals or entities that submit false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. The False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly or recklessly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim for payment approved. Private parties may initiate qui tam whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the False Claims Act in the name of the government and may share in the proceeds of a successful suit.

The federal government has used the False Claims Act to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and state healthcare programs. By way of illustration, these prosecutions may be based upon alleged coding errors, billing for services not rendered, billing services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, and billing for care that is not considered medically necessary. The government and a number of courts also have taken the position that claims presented in violation of certain other statutes, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law, can be considered a violation of the False Claims Act based on the theory that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement.

Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the government. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for the imposition of administrative penalties as well as exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition to the provisions of the False Claims Act, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government also can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government.

A number of states have enacted false claims acts that are similar to the federal False Claims Act. Even more states are expected to do so in the future because Section 6031 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (“DRA”), amended the federal law to encourage these types of changes, along with a corresponding increase in state initiated false claims enforcement efforts. Under the DRA, if a state enacts a false claims act that is at least as stringent as the federal statute and that also meets certain other requirements, the state will be eligible to receive a greater share of any monetary recovery obtained pursuant to certain actions brought under the state’s false claims act. The Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), in consultation with the Attorney General of the United States, is responsible for determining if a state’s false claims act complies with the statutory requirements.


17


Anti-Kickback Statutes

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a provision of the Social Security Act that prohibits as a felony offense the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (1) the referral of a patient for items or services for which payment may be made in whole or part under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs, (2) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs or (3) the purchase, lease, or order or arranging or recommending the purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) amended section 1128B of the Social Security Act to make it clear that a person need not have actual knowledge of the statute, or specific intent to violate the statute, as a predicate for a violation. The OIG, which has the authority to impose administrative sanctions for violation of the statute, has adopted as its standard for review a judicial interpretation which concludes that the statute prohibits any arrangement where even one purpose of the remuneration is to induce or reward referrals. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a felony punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines of up to $25,000, civil fines of up to $50,000 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. A violation also can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. In addition, pursuant to the changes of the ACA, a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a false claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.

Due to the breadth of the Anti-Kickback Statute’s broad prohibitions, statutory exceptions exist that protect certain arrangements from prosecution. In addition, the OIG has published safe harbor regulations that specify arrangements that also are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute, provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of an activity to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute, but these arrangements may be subject to scrutiny and prosecution by enforcement agencies.

Some states have enacted statutes and regulations similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, but which may be applicable regardless of the payor source for the patient. These state laws may contain exceptions and safe harbors that are different from and/or more limited than those of the federal law and that may vary from state to state.

Federal Stark Law

The federal Stark Law, also known as the physician self-referral law, generally prohibits a physician from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity (including hospitals) providing ‘‘designated health services,’’ if the physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has a ‘‘financial relationship’’ with the entity, unless a specific exception applies. Designated health services include, among other services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, clinical laboratory services, certain imaging services, and other items or. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral; and therefore, unlike the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, intent to violate the law is not required. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law contains a number of statutory and regulatory exceptions intended to protect certain types of transactions and business arrangements from penalty. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute with which compliance is voluntary, an arrangement must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law exception, or the arrangement is in violation of the Stark Law.

The penalties for violating the Stark Law can include the denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the statute, mandatory refunds of any sums paid for such services and civil penalties of up to $15,000 for each violation, double damages, and possible exclusion from future participation in the governmental healthcare programs. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibitions may be fined up to $100,000 for each applicable arrangement or scheme.

Some states have enacted statutes and regulations similar to the Stark Law, but which may be applicable to the referral of patients regardless of their payor source and which may apply to different types of services. These state laws may contain statutory and regulatory exceptions that are different from those of the federal law and that may vary from state to state.


18


Because the Stark Law and its implementing regulations continue to evolve, we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of this law and its regulations. There can be no assurance that the arrangements entered into by us with physicians and facilities will be found to be in compliance with the Stark Law, as it ultimately may be implemented or interpreted.

Health Information Privacy and Security Standards

Among other directives, the Administrative Simplification Provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), required the Department of Health and Human Services, or the HHS, to adopt standards to protect the privacy and security of certain health-related information. The HIPAA privacy regulations contain detailed requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information by “HIPAA covered entities,” which include entities like the Company, and the providers we may work with.

In addition to the privacy requirements, HIPAA covered entities must implement certain administrative, physical, and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of certain electronic health information received, maintained, or transmitted. HIPAA also implemented the use of standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions, including activities associated with the billing and collection of healthcare claims.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act enacted on February 18, 2009, included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) which modified the HIPAA legislation significantly. Pursuant to HITECH, certain provisions of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations become directly applicable to “HIPAA business associates”.

Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security standards may result in civil and criminal penalties. Historically, these included: (1) civil money penalties of $100 per incident, to a maximum of $25,000, per person, per year, per standard violated and (2) depending upon the nature of the violation, fines of up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to ten years. The passage of HITECH significantly modified the enforcement structure, creating a tiered system of civil money penalties that range from $100 to $50,000 per violation, with a cap of $1.5 million per year for identical violations. We must also comply with the “breach notification” regulations, which implement certain provisions of HITECH. Under these regulations, in addition to reasonable remediation, covered entities must promptly notify affected individuals in the case of a breach of “unsecured PHI,” which is defined by HHS guidance, as well as the HHS Secretary and the media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to the HHS Secretary on an annual basis. The regulations also require business associates of covered entities to notify the covered entity of breaches at or by the business associate.

Many states also have laws that protect the privacy and security of confidential, personal information. These laws may be similar to or even more stringent than the federal provisions. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but some may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused.

Financial Information and Privacy Standards

In addition to privacy and security laws focused on health care data, multiple other federal and state laws regulate the use and disclosure of consumer’s financial information (“Personal Information”). Many of these laws also require administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of Personal Information, including mandated processes and timeframes for notification of possible or actual breaches of Personal Information to the affected individual. The Federal Trade Commission primarily oversees compliance with the federal laws relevant to us, while state laws are addressed by the state attorney general or other respective state agencies. As with HIPAA, enforcement of laws protecting financial information is increasing. Examples of relevant federal laws include the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

19

Other Federal Healthcare Compliance Laws

We are also subject to other federal healthcare laws.

In 1995, Congress amended the federal criminal statutes set forth in Title 18 of the United States Code by defining additional federal crimes that could have an impact on our business, including “Health Care Fraud” and “False Statements Relating to Health Care Matters.” The Health Care Fraud provision prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. As defined in this provision of Title 18, a “healthcare benefit program” can be either a government or private payor plan. Violation of this statute may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment, or both. The ACA amended section 1347 of Title 18 to provide that a person may be convicted under the Health Care Fraud provision even in the absence of proof that the person had actual knowledge of, or specific intent to violate, the statute.

The False Statements Relating to Health Care Matters provision prohibits, in any matter involving a federal health care program, anyone from knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up, by any trick, scheme or device, a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing that it contains a materially false or fraudulent statement. A violation of this statute may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment, or both.

Under the Civil Monetary Penalties law of the Social Security Act, a person, including any individual or organization, may be subject to civil monetary penalties, treble damages, and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs for certain specified conduct. One provision of the Civil Monetary Penalties law precludes any person (including an organization) from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to any United States officer, employee, agent, or department, or any state agency, a claim for payment for medical or other items or services that the person knows or should know (a) were not provided as described in the coding of the claim, (b) is a false or fraudulent claim, (c) is for a service furnished by an unlicensed physician, (d) is for medical or other items or service furnished by a person or an entity that is in a period of exclusion from the program or (e) are medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of the law may result in penalties of up to $10,000 per claim, treble damages, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. In addition, the OIG may impose civil monetary penalties against any physician who knowingly accepts payment from a hospital (as well as against the hospital making the payment) as an inducement to reduce or limit services provided to Medicare or Medicaid program beneficiaries. Further, except as specifically permitted under the Civil Monetary Penalties law, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act.

Other State Healthcare Compliance Provisions

In addition to the state laws previously described, we also are subject to other state fraud and abuse statutes and regulations. Many of the states in which we operate or plan to expand to have adopted a form of anti-kickback law, self-referral prohibition, and false claims and insurance fraud prohibition. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Generally, state laws reach to all healthcare services and not just those covered under a governmental healthcare program. A determination of liability under any of these laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these states. We cannot assure that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws.
Licensing, Certification, Accreditation and Related Laws and Guidelines

The providers we may work with are subject to numerous federal, state, and local licensing laws and regulations, relating to, among other things, professional credentialing, and professional ethics. Since the Company provides its services to healthcare facilities, it may indirectly be subject to laws applicable to those entities as well as ethical guidelines and operating standards of professional trade associations and private accreditation commissions, such as the American Medical Association and The Joint Commission. There are penalties for non-compliance with these laws and standards, including loss of professional license, civil or criminal fines and penalties, loss of hospital admitting privileges, and exclusion from participation in various governmental and other third-party healthcare programs. Our ability to operate profitably will depend, in part, upon our ability and the ability of the providers to obtain and maintain all necessary licenses and other approvals and operate in compliance with applicable health care laws and regulations, including any new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations.

Intellectual Property

The Company does not currently own any patents or trademarks. The Company expects to rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how protection for our confidential and proprietary information, however we have not yet taken security measures to protect this information. 
Employees

We currently have 50 full time employees, 12 consultants, 6 independently contracted sales representatives and 4 part time employees.

Coronavirus (COVID-19)

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic which continued to spread throughout the U.S. and the globe. In addition to the devastating effects on human life, the pandemic is continuing to have a negative ripple effect on the global economy, leading to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets. There are no comparable events that provide guidance as to the effect the COVID-19 pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate effect of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. COVID-19 has already hindered or slowed many of HSH’s businesses, including but not limited to our growth and growth strategies, developments in the marketplace for products, therapies and services, financial results, research and development strategy, regulatory approvals, and competitive strengths. The direct or indirect impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition, continues today, but HSH has thus far weathered the pandemic storm and continues to seek to improve our level of service and patient care. The extent of the ultimate impact of the pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance will depend on various developments, including the duration and continued spread of the outbreak, which cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. Accordingly, while management reasonably expects the COVID-19 outbreak to negatively impact the Company, the related consequences and duration are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.
Reports to Security Holders

We intend to furnish our shareholders’ annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting firm and to make available quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements for each of the first three quarters of each year. We file Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Current Reports on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to meet our timely and continuous disclosure requirements. We may also file additional documents with the Commission if they become necessary in the course of our company’s operations.
