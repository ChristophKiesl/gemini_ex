ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Our Business
We are a digital technology company that provides email and collaboration software, cloud-based identity management platforms, managed web and mobile portals, and advertising solutions. Our customers include communications providers, media companies, government entities and enterprises. We are their trusted partner for enterprise software platforms and monetization solutions that we deliver through public and private cloud software-as-a-service, software licensing, and professional services. Our platforms enable our clients to deepen engagement with their consumers and users.
On February 10, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger ("the Merger Agreement") with CLP SY Holding, LLC ("Parent") and SY Merger Sub Corporation an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser") an affiliate of Centre Lane Partners, LLC, a New York-based private investment firm, to be acquired in an all-cash transaction that values Synacor, in the aggregate, at approximately $92 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser and Parent on March 3, 2021 commenced a tender offer (the "Offer") to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Synacor at a purchase price of $2.20 per share payable net to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law (such consideration as it may be amended from time to time pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the “Offer Price”). The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, as soon as practicable following the acceptance and purchase by Purchaser of the shares of Synacor common stock in the Offer, Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, with the Merger to be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the “DGCL”). Because the Merger will be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL, assuming the requirements of Section 251(h) of the DGCL are met, no vote of the stockholders of the Company will be required to consummate the Merger. As a result of, and at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of Synacor common stock not purchased in the Offer (other than (1) shares of Synacor common stock owned by Parent, Purchaser or the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or the Company, including all shares of Synacor common stock held by the Company as treasury stock, or (2) shares of Synacor common stock that are held by any stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with the provisions of, Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price from Purchaser.
Products and Services
Cloud ID Authentication
Synacor develops and operates a cloud-based identity and access management platform for large enterprises that runs authentication, user lifecycle management and identity security for our customer’s end users when they need to sign-in to online applications and access their services with networked devices.
Consumers access their online services and subscription content using a myriad of devices where many find the login process frustrating. Enterprises are challenged to handle the digital identities of tens of millions of consumers and resiliently unlock access during online events that require thousands of verifications per second, often breaking under the load. 
Synacor Cloud ID managed identity services resiliently scale to handle the largest enterprises without requiring customers to install on-premises identity management systems. Cloud ID simplifies the end user experience by offering native single sign on, home-based authentication and device management to reduce login friction and improve security.
Email/Collaboration
Our open and extensible Email/Collaboration platform is used by service providers, regulated entities (government & financial institutions), enterprises, and small and medium sized businesses around the world. Branded as Zimbra, our open-standards-based Email/Collaboration platform powers hundreds of millions of mailboxes globally through our network of over 1,900 channel partners (value-added resellers, or VARs, and Business Service Providers, or BSPs) and about 4,000 licensed customers. Zimbra is delivered as software-as-a-service through public and private cloud infrastructure, and as licensed software. Our Email/Collaboration Services include white-label hosting, security and migration.
Managed Portals and Advertising
Our Managed Portals and Advertising solutions provide our customers with substantial revenue opportunities generated by their consumers’ engagement across devices. Our Managed Portals are intended to be daily destinations for consumers and are delivered across devices and under our customers’ own brand names. To help our customers increase their consumers’ engagement, we deliver relevant content, such as top news, entertainment, and long and short-form video and apps, on our Managed Portals. We have licensing and distribution agreements with a wide range of programmers and content and service providers. In addition, consumers have the ability through our portals to manage their email and messaging, pay bills, receive special promotions and perform other account management needs.
We monetize the online traffic generated by consumers through search advertising, digital advertising (including video), and syndicated content on our Managed Portals. As we monetize our customers’ online traffic on our Managed Portals, we share a portion of this revenue with our customers, resulting in a mutually beneficial partnership.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is, with operational and financial discipline, to:
•increase value for existing customers by optimizing consumer experience and monetization;
•innovate on Synacor-as-a-platform for advanced services;
•win new customers in current and related verticals; and
•extend our product portfolio into emerging growth areas.
Innovating on Synacor-as-a-platform for advanced services
Our Cloud ID Authentication platform is reported as having some of the highest consumer login success rates in the industry.
Cloud ID supports four of the top OTT players, simplifying their consumer log-in experiences under extreme traffic loads. Synacor is the leading provider of ISP on-network home-based authentication and Apple Single Sign-On for TV providers. Since 2019, Cloud ID has built on a record of success by delivering highly-scalable authorization of video streaming to enter new markets for consumer identity and access management, now serves 20 million unique users per month. Cloud ID, empowers our clients, in aggregate reaching over 100 million accounts, to utilize Synacor's managed identity services to reliably unlock access for their subscribers in the simplest manner possible and to quickly extend services to new distribution partners and the latest consumer electronics devices. 
Winning new customers in current and related verticals
We have an established presence among broadband and pay-TV providers in the U.S. and Canada. Some of these providers use our complete suite of solutions, and others use only certain components. We view this as a growth opportunity within our existing customer base.
In 2020, Synacor added 330 new Zimbra Email and Collaboration Suite enterprise and government customers around the world.
Increasing value for existing customers by optimizing user experience and monetization
With respect to our Managed Portals and Advertising solutions, we have made major upgrades to our portal platform that yield significant benefits. Our new platform has increased page performance by 60% and reduced bounce rate by over 50% on average. Our portal, with its engaging user experience and responsive design for desktop and mobile web, have video threaded throughout and is designed to optimize consumer engagement and monetization. Our latest upgrades increase page performance and deliver a cleaner user experience that results in improved user engagement while decreasing the implementation time for customers to launch and also decreasing the resources necessary to maintain and support the product.
Extending our product portfolio into emerging growth areas
We plan to capitalize on opportunities such as international expansion and delivery of business services. Through our acquisition of the Zimbra assets we have expanded our international customer base, and we believe this represents an opportunity to find new customers for our Managed Portals and Advertising solutions.
Technology and Operations
Technology Architecture
Our products leverage technology that is reliable, fault tolerant and scalable through the addition of more servers as usage grows. In 2020 we invested heavily in providing these same capabilities using public cloud technologies. In addition to the existing reliable/fault tolerant infrastructure, cloud technologies enable us to provide self-healing software, auto-scaling, and automated deployments.
Data Center Facilities
We currently operate and maintain five data centers in regionally diverse locations and have a network operations center that is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Our primary data centers are located in shared facilities in Allen, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Lewis Center, Ohio; Toronto, Canada; and Watertown, Massachusetts. All systems are fully monitored for reporting continuity and fault isolation. The data centers are each in a physically secure facility using monitoring, environmental alarms, closed circuit television and redundant power sources. Our network operations center also is located in a secure facility.
Customers
Our recurring and fee-based customers consist of high-speed internet service providers along with enterprises, government and nonprofit organizations, either directly or through resellers. Contracts with these customers typically have an initial term of one to three years and frequently provide for one or more automatic renewal terms of one to two years each. Our recurring and fee-based customer contracts also typically contain service level agreements that call for specific system “up times” and 24 hours per day, seven days per week support. As of December 31, 2020, we had agreements, both directly and indirectly through resellers, with over 120 high-speed internet service providers and over 4,000 enterprise, government and nonprofit customers. 
Our Managed Portals and Advertising customers principally consist of high-speed internet service providers. Contracts with these customers typically have an initial term of two to three years from the deployment of our Managed Portals and frequently provide for one or more automatic renewal terms of one to two years each. 
Content and Service Providers
We license the content available in our Managed Portals, as well as premium services, from numerous third-party content and service partners. These partners provide a variety of content, including news and information, entertainment, video, games, shopping, travel, and finance. Our relationships with content providers give consumers access to over five hundred thousand articles and one million short-form videos each month. To obtain this content, we enter into a variety of licensing arrangements with the content providers. These arrangements are typically one to two years in duration with payment terms that may be based on traffic, advertising revenue share, number of subscribers, flat fee payments over time, or some combination thereof. In addition to using licensed content to populate our Managed Portals, we also provide premium services that subscribers may purchase for additional fees.
Sales and Marketing
Email/Collaboration
We market our Email/Collaboration product through both direct and indirect sales channels. Our regional sales and marketing teams host several events each year with partners and run various campaigns to generate sales leads. Once a lead has been identified, our internal sales representatives work closely with our regional partners on better identifying the opportunity and gathering customer requirements.
We sell to internet service providers primarily through a direct sales force consisting of regional account executives. Sales cycles can be six months or longer. We sell to prospective government, nonprofit and enterprise customers through a two-tier indirect model via more than 1,590 channel partners (VARs and BSPs). Our VARs sell on-premise licenses to end customers while our BSPs sell a cloud service to the end customer. Sales cycles can range from thirty days to six months, depending on size and scope.
Managed Portals and Advertising Solutions
Synacor’s managed portal network and publisher-focused advertising platform reaches over 200 million monthly unique visitors. Our advertising solutions enable our customers to earn incremental revenue by monetizing media from their consumers across all popular devices.
Our advertising sales team sells advertising inventory directly to advertisers and/or to advertising agencies representing those advertisers, as well as employing programmatic ad monetization strategies utilizing ad exchanges via real-time bidding. These advertisers may be small companies with the advertising locally or regionally focused on the Managed Portals of one customer, or large companies with nationwide advertising on the Managed Portals of many customers as well as on our syndicated group of publishers’ sites. We have a team of direct advertising sales employees, independent advertising sales representatives, and programmatic ad specialists focused on this effort and expect to continue to develop this team and attempt to grow the amount of advertising revenue generated with our customers. As of December 31, 2020, we had arrangements with over 100 advertising partners.
Managed Portals
Our managed portal network consists of white-labeled browser start pages and iOS/Android start apps that serve as daily destinations for consumers. Powered by our media and programming library which includes news, entertainment, and short and long form video, these products increase consumer engagement and generate advertising revenue. They also provide consumers with self-management capabilities for email and messaging, bill paying and other account management activities.
Syndicated Advertising
Synacor’s syndicated advertising platform works with hundreds of publishers to deliver brand-safe monetization that leverages scale, premium brands and programmatic technology across desktop and mobile. We help publishers dynamically target different audiences by matching relevant content to the right users across multiple devices. Publishers also leverage our demand facilitation services to connect premium advertisers and brands with their target audiences on brand-safe sites.
Government Regulation
As a cloud-based business serving global video, internet and communications providers, device manufacturers, governments and others, we are required to comply with a variety of laws and other legal obligations. Some jurisdictions, both in the United States and abroad, have enacted or proposed laws and other legal obligations governing, among other things, the internet, online entertainment and other aspects of our businesses. These laws and other legal obligations cover issues such as taxation, pricing, content, distribution, quality and delivery of products and services, electronic contracts, intellectual property rights, and privacy and security of personal information in our possession or under our control.
Federal laws of the United States that could have an impact on our business include the following: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which is intended to reduce the liability of online service providers of third-party content, including content that may infringe copyrights or other rights of third parties; the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which imposes restrictions on the ability of online service providers to collect information from children under 13 years of age; and the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act, which requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances.
There have been numerous laws and other legal obligations adopted in the United States and around the world regarding privacy and the collection, destruction, protection, sharing, storing, and use of personal information. The impact of these laws and other legal obligations on our business is increasing as more jurisdictions attempt to protect personal information. In light of a rapidly changing legal landscape, as well as rapidly changing technology, these laws and other legal obligations are at times subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent or conflict with laws and other legal obligations of other jurisdictions. While we are committed to remaining in compliance with all laws and other legal obligations, there may be instances when it is problematic to do so. 
The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which took effect in May 2018, applies to personal information relating to individuals in the European Union in our possession or under our control. The GDPR includes comprehensive requirements for companies that process such personal information, regardless of the location of the processing, and provides for significant penalties for non-compliance. 
Pursuant to the GDPR, personal information relating to individuals in the European Union can only be transferred from the European Union to other countries that have adequate laws and other legal requirements in place to protect such personal information. The European Union has determined that the United States currently does not have adequate laws and other legal requirements in place to protect such personal information. In response, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission adopted the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, and the U.S. Department of Commerce and Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner adopted the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. The purpose of the privacy shields is to enable businesses in the United States that desire to receive transfers of personal information relating to individuals in the European Union to certify to their compliance with the GDPR and other applicable law. However, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “CJEU”) invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, and shortly thereafter, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner questioned the validity of the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. In doing so, the CJEU suggested that U.S. businesses could use other methods available under the GDPR for meeting the so-called “adequacy requirement” (e.g. standard contractual clauses and binding corporate rules), but it is possible that, in applying the same analysis used in invalidating the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, the CJEU could at some point invalidate these other methods as well. 
We initially certified to being in compliance with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield in December 2016 and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield in June 2017, and have renewed our certifications each year thereafter. We currently plan on renewing our certifications for the foreseeable future, in addition to, or in lieu of, using any other method available under the GDPR for complying with the “adequacy requirement” to continue transferring personal information from the European Union to the United States.
The California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020, requires certain businesses to, among other things, provide (1) certain data relating to their collection and use of personal information of California consumers, (2) data access and deletion rights to California consumers, and (3) California consumers with the right to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. While it remains unclear how some provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted, significant penalties can be imposed for non-compliance with the CCPA or data breaches. The California Attorney General began enforcing the CCPA as of July 1, 2020, and has adopted detailed regulations to clarify some of its provisions.
The California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), which was recently passed, but is not effective until January 1, 2023, supplements and enhances the CCPA. Due to the requirements of the CPRA, many businesses have already begun to comply with its terms. The CPRA requires stricter protection of consumer privacy, similar to the GDPR, and imposes privacy and data security requirements for businesses. In addition, the CPRA establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency as an “independent watchdog,” vested with “full administrative power, authority, and jurisdiction to implement and enforce the [CPRA].” 
There are currently pending a number of legislative proposals in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and other jurisdictions that could impose additional obligations affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement. In addition, some countries and other jurisdictions are considering, or have passed, legislation that mandates local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services.
We strive to comply with all applicable laws and other legal obligations, company policies, and industry-standard codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. Compliance with any such applicable laws and other legal obligations, company policies, and industry-standard codes of conduct (including, but not limited to, the GDPR and the CCPA) could require us to incur additional costs and expenses. At the same time, the failure to comply with such applicable laws and other legal obligations, company policies, and industry-standard codes of conduct could result in governmental enforcement actions, significant damages and fines being imposed on us, loss of the ability to transfer E.U. personal data to the United States, litigation, restrictions on our and our customers’ ability to market products and services, uncertainty of internet usage, reductions in the demand for our products and services, and mandatory changes to our privacy and data security practices, as well as our products and services.
Intellectual Property
We believe that the protection of our intellectual property is critical to our success. We rely on copyright, trademark and patent enforcement, contractual restrictions and trade secret, trade dress and domain name laws to protect our brand and other proprietary and intellectual property rights. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements and other agreements containing confidentiality protections with certain parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure of, our proprietary information and technology, such as trade secrets, confidential information, know-how and technical information. We have applied for patents to protect certain of our intellectual property.  In addition, we have acquired intellectual property, including patents and trademarks, through our acquisitions including Zimbra, Technorati, NimbleTV and Teknision. We have three trademark registrations in the United States for SYNACOR (U.S. Registration Numbers 5108679, 2845578 and 2811272).
We endeavor to protect our internally-developed systems and maintain our trademarks. We generally control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and our software is protected by United States and international copyright laws.
In addition to legal protections, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements and reliable product support and services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position.
Competition
The market for internet-based services and products in which we operate is highly competitive and involves rapidly-changing technologies and customer and consumer requirements, as well as evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions. While we believe that our technology offers considerable value and flexibility to our customers by helping them to extend their consumer relationships to a wide variety of internet-based services, we face competition at four levels:
•When one of our prospective or existing customers considers another supplier, including one of our partners, for elements of the services or products which we provide.
•When consumers choose to rely on other vendors for similar products and services.
•When content and service providers prefer to establish direct relationships with one or more of our customers.
•When one of our customers decides to make the significant headcount and technology investment to develop products and services in-house similar to those that we provide.
Our technology competes primarily with high-speed internet service providers that have internal information technology staff capable of developing similar solutions in-house.
Email/Collaboration
With respect to our Email/Collaboration solutions, we compete primarily with Google and Microsoft in the enterprise and government markets, and with Open-Xchange and OpenWave in the internet service provider markets.
We believe the principal competitive factors in the email/collaboration market include a company’s ability to:
•provide customers the ability to perform security and compliance audits of our source code;
•deliver anti-spam, anti-phishing, anti-virus and encryption technologies;
•provide products and services at lowest possible total cost of ownership (TCO);
•provide local partners the ability to store data within the legal jurisdiction of the country where their customers do business;
•provide an enterprise-ready solution suitable for large-scale deployments including such enterprise features such as delegated administration, detailed logging, and performance and availability transparency;
•offer access to real-time performance and availability statistics;
•afford customers and partners the ability to rebrand their cloud collaboration experience; and
•make available to partners both integrations and extensions to the collaboration cloud environment specific to customers’ needs.
We believe that we distinguish ourselves from potential competitors in several ways. First, we offer our Email/Collaboration products and services a la carte, enabling customers to buy only the services they need, providing for a much lower TCO. Second, our Zimbra Email/Collaboration solution is a complete feature-rich, enterprise-ready solution scalable up to 40 million mailboxes. Finally, our products are customizable and extendable and designed to meet very high standards of security.
Managed Portals and Advertising Solutions
In addition, with respect to our Managed Portals and Advertising solutions, we compete with companies such as Facebook, Inc.; Google; Verizon Media; and MSN, a division of Microsoft Corporation, or Microsoft, which have destination websites of their own or are capable of delivering content, service offerings and search or advertising models similar to ours.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets include a company’s ability to:
•reinforce the brands of our cable, satellite, telecom and consumer electronics customers;
•produce products that are flexible and easy to use;
•offer competitive fees for Managed Portal development and operation;
•generate additional revenue for our customers;
•enable our customers to be involved in designing the “look and feel” of their online presence;
•offer services and products that meet the changing needs of our customers and their consumers, including emerging technologies and standards;
•provide high-quality product support to assist the customer’s service representatives; and
•aggregate content to deliver more compelling bundled packages of paid content.
We believe that we distinguish ourselves from potential competitors in three principal ways. First, we provide a white-label solution that, unlike the co-branded approach of most of our competitors, creates a consumer experience that reinforces our customers’ and partners’ brands. Second, we give customers control over the sign-on process and billing function for a wide range of internet services and content by integrating with their internal systems (where applicable) thereby allowing our customers to “own the consumer.” Finally, our solutions are flexible and neutral, meaning that we allow deliverables that are customized to our customers’ specific needs.
Human Capital Resources
Due to the specialized nature of our business, our performance depends on identifying, attracting, developing, motivating, and retaining a highly skilled workforce. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 142 employees in the United States and 131 based internationally. Of these employees, 270 were full-time employees.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider current employee relations to be good.
Diversity and inclusion are a business imperative for us, as we believe it is key to our future success. We have focused our diversity and inclusion initiatives on employee recruitment, outreach, and employee training and development, such as expanding the diverse talent pipeline and employee engagement. Through these and other focused efforts, we have improved the diversity of our overall workforce and within leadership positions, specifically in the representation of women, people of color, and people with disabilities.
