ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on June 1, 2017. We are a development stage company and have extremely limited financial resources. We have not commenced operation nor have we established a source of equity or debt financing. Our original business focused on an online market and community connecting private United States companies and companies which are publicly traded in the U.S. with potential investors from all over the world, except for U.S. residents, with a goal of providing these companies with exposure to as many potential investors from outside the U.S. as possible, while providing those potential investors with different investment opportunities in the foregoing companies. 
 
Pursuant to certain stock purchase agreement, entered into as of August 12, 2020, as amended, an individual investor purchased 1,500,000 shares of our common stock from our then majority stockholder and sole officer and director, Itzhak Ostashinsky, representing 78.4% of the voting securities of our company. Following this change of control, Xin Jiang was appointed to serve as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary and director and we changed our business plan to engage in health-related business in the People’s Republic of China. 
 
Effective November 6, 2020, our name was changed to “Chengda Technology Co., Ltd.” through the filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation, which was approved by our Board of Directors. 
 
We plan to operate in the field of health-related products, with a focus on the developing and promoting selenium-infused mineral water and energy mattress. In addition, we plan to offer health services, including health assessments, health consultations, and health recoveries. We are currently evaluating the optimal approaches to implement these plans, including through mergers and acquisitions of health products or services companies in China. Due to the dynamic nature and the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate the timeline to implement our business plans. We aim to start the health-related business in 2021 and the funds to finance the start-up of the new business will primarily come from our major stockholder.
