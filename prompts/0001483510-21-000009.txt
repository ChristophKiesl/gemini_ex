GENERAL

Express is a modern, versatile, dual gender apparel and accessories brand that helps people get dressed for every day and any occasion. Launched in 1980 with the idea that style, quality and value should all be found in one place, Express has always been a brand of the now, offering some of the most important and enduring fashion trends. Express aims to Create Confidence and Inspire Self-Expression through a design and merchandising view that brings forward The Best of Now for Real Life Versatility. 
As of January 30, 2021, we operated 570 stores across the United States and in Puerto Rico, including 210 factory outlet stores. Our stores are located primarily in high-traffic shopping malls, lifestyle centers, outlet centers, and street locations, and average approximately 8,500 gross square feet. We also sell our products through our eCommerce website, www.express.com, and our mobile app, as well as through franchisees who operate Express locations in Latin America pursuant to franchise agreements. Our 2020 merchandise sales were comprised of approximately 60% women's merchandise and approximately 40% men's merchandise.

COMPETITION AND COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS

The apparel retail market is highly competitive. We compete with other omni-channel retailers that engage in the retail sale of women's and men's apparel, accessories, and similar merchandise. We compete on the basis of a combination of factors, including, among others, style, breadth, quality, and price of merchandise offered, in-store and online customer experience, and brand image. 
We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors as follows:
•Established Lifestyle Brand
With more than 40 years of heritage, the Express brand represents a distinct fashion point of view, that creates confidence and inspires self-expression. Express has an edited assortment designed for real-life versatility. The Express brand differentiates itself by offering 1) mix and match versatility; 2) products that are new and now; and 3) enduring modern tailored products.
•Reengineered Go To Market Processes
During 2019, we thoroughly assessed our existing processes and identified a number of opportunities for improvement. As a result, we implemented our new go to market process in the Spring of 2020 and our teams have been better aligned, our products speed to market has increased, and we have better cross functional coordination in the field and at the home office. This transformed process began with a unified brand presentation increasing our speed to market, streamlining our calendars, and ensuring better integration across all of our marketing touchpoints. Our goal is to be more efficient, more effective, and more connected across functions and faster to market at a reduced cost. We have also worked more

closely with our suppliers to achieve better alignment on the aesthetics, fit and quality our customers want. All of these efforts will help us bring more newness in our assortment, more often. 
•Strong and Experienced Team
Our existing team, at and below the leadership level, has extensive experience in the retail apparel industry, including depth in the areas of fashion design and merchandising, supply chain management, marketing, customer experience, eCommerce, store operations, technology, planning and allocation, and real estate, as well as other diverse business experiences that we believe are valuable to us as we continue to execute our growth strategy. Experience within Express extends deep into our organization, including district and store managers. 

OUR PRODUCTS

The majority of our apparel designs are created by our in-house design team. We believe every day is an occasion and we want to help our customers dress for it. The Express Edit is our product approach and mindset. It is about focus, curation, and standing for certain elements of fashion and style that we know matter most to our customers. Below are the five ideas that define the Express Edit.
•Mix & Match Versatility
◦The lines between work and weekend wardrobes have blurred, so every piece in the closet has to work hard and be able to be worn to multiple wearing occasions. 
•New & Now
◦Express will once again become a place for customers to find what’s new at the quality and price they expect. 
•Modern Tailored
◦Our brand has the credentials to be a go-to resource for great quality suits and tailored separates at a great value proposition. We are known for modern tailoring, and it is a core strength that we will leverage and expand.
•Denim Everywhere
◦We believe we can become a go-to resource for refined denim. We have crafted a denim assortment with greater breadth of fits and washes in order to deliver on versatility for our customers. 
•Best of Black
◦Our customers gravitate to the modernity and simplicity of black, and we intend to refresh their closets by introducing new shapes and silhouettes grounded in this universal color.
We plan our product assortments and display them in our stores and online in a coordinated manner to encourage our customers to purchase items that can be worn in multiple ways for multiple wearing occasions. We believe this allows us to better meet our customers' shopping objectives while differentiating our product offerings from competitors. On average, our customers purchase two to three items per transaction. 

OMNICHANNEL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

We are committed to enhancing our omnichannel customer experience that offers a seamless shopping experience whether the customer is shopping in a store or online through a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. We believe the lines between our store and eCommerce channels are disappearing as customers increasingly interact with us both in-store and online and often through mobile devices while in stores. As a result, we are focused on leveraging the best of both channels to create an exceptional omnichannel shopping experience.

We design our stores to create a distinctive and engaging shopping environment and project our image of Express as a fashion authority. Our stores feature a vibrant and youthful look, bright signage, and popular music. Our stores are constructed and finished to allow us to efficiently shift merchandise displays throughout the year as seasons dictate. To further enhance our customers' experience, we seek to attract enthusiastic store associates who are committed to offering a high level of customer service. We believe our managers and associates are well equipped to assist and inspire our customers as a result of education and training we provide, the culture of accountability we foster, the incentives we offer, and the decision-making authority we grant to store managers. On average, our store managers have been with Express for approximately seven years.
Similar to our stores, our eCommerce capabilities focus on creating an engaging and easy shopping experience that supports a vibrant, young fashion consumer, whether on a mobile device, tablet, or desktop, with a particular focus on the mobile experience. We recognize the growing preference for online shopping and continue to make enhancements to the online customer experience through improved search, site navigation and checkout capabilities, and targeted customer messaging, making shopping easier for customers. During 2020, we focused on advancing our eCommerce and omnichannel experience, particularly as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in more of our customers shopping online. We did this with enhanced and expanded buy-online-pick-up-in-store and ship-from-store functionalities, both of which contribute to more efficient, and effective inventory management. Additionally, we enhanced the way we engage and service our customers in the digital channel. We expanded our Digital Stylist program by increasing the resources available, to provide more real-time, virtual assistance to express.com customers. We plan to expand this program as we move into 2021 by shifting some of our physical store associates into these Digital Stylist roles. Additionally we plan to optimize our online product assortment through product extensions, and expand and grow our Marketplace business with the addition of new categories such as active, swimwear, and intimates. 

MARKETING

We use a variety of marketing vehicles designed to acquire new customers, engage with existing customers, increase customer traffic in-store and online, and build brand loyalty. We seek to optimize our customer relationship management ("CRM") through a number of tactics, such as test and learn programs, circulation and offer models, and greater use of digital marketing.
We use a proprietary customer database, together with data analytics, to customize our communications and make targeted offers to customers in an effort to increase customer traffic in-store and online and to increase conversion. In addition, in August 2020, we completed the soft relaunch of our loyalty program, now called Express Insider. Our loyalty program members have the greatest lifetime value to Express. This program is a critical factor in gaining additional share of existing customers' spend and bringing new customers into the brand. We anticipate implementing additional enhancements to our Express Insider program in the first quarter of 2021, including the new participation tiers, new benefits, a digital wallet feature, and making it easier for customers to earn, track, and redeem their benefits. We also offer a private-label credit card through an agreement (the "Card Agreement") with Comenity Bank (the “Bank”) under which the Bank owns the credit card accounts and Alliance Data Systems Corporation provides services to our private-label credit card customers. All of our proprietary credit cards carry the Express logo.

TECHNOLOGY

We rely on information technology to operate our business. Our information technology provides a full range of business process support and information to our store, eCommerce, merchandising, financial, and real estate teams. We utilize a combination of customized and industry standard software systems to provide various functions related to point-of-sale, inventory management, design, planning and allocation, and financial reporting. During 2020, we launched multiple system upgrades, including an updated order management system and a new assortment planning system to improve coordination and support our new go to market strategy. We believe these new systems will continue to allow us to increase speed-to-market, conduct planning and allocation with more precision, and ultimately give us the ability to maximize inventory productivity and reduce markdowns over time.

SOURCING

Our Sourcing Methods
We utilize a broad base of manufacturers located throughout the world that we believe produce goods at the level of quality that our customers desire and can supply products to us on a timely basis at competitive prices. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and, as a result, contract with third-party vendors for the production of all of our merchandise. We purchase both apparel and accessories through buying agents and directly from vendors. In exchange for a commission, our buying agents identify suitable vendors and coordinate our purchasing requirements with vendors by placing orders for merchandise on our behalf, ensuring the timely delivery of goods to us, obtaining samples of merchandise produced in factories, inspecting finished merchandise, and carrying out vendor compliance monitoring and administrative communications on our behalf.
We purchase the majority of our merchandise outside of the United States through arrangements with approximately 105 vendors utilizing approximately 321 manufacturing facilities located in approximately 26 countries throughout the world, primarily in Asia. The top five countries from which we sourced our merchandise in 2020 were Vietnam, China, Indonesia, India, and Pakistan, based on total cost of merchandise purchased. The top 10 manufacturing facilities, based on cost, supplied approximately 29% of our merchandise in 2020. We purchase merchandise using purchase orders, and therefore are not subject to long-term production contracts with any vendors, manufacturers, or buying agents.
Quality Assurance and Compliance Monitoring
Each supplier, factory, and subcontractor that manufactures our merchandise is required to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct and certain other purchasing terms and conditions, including those related to product quality. This is designed to ensure that each of our suppliers' operations are conducted in a legal, ethical, and responsible manner. Our Code of Vendor Conduct requires that each of our suppliers provides minimum wages and benefits, limits working hours, complies with all laws, including environmental laws, and provides a safe and healthy work environment. It also forbids the use of child labor or forced labor, and prohibits unauthorized subcontracting. We monitor compliance through third parties who conduct regular factory audits on our behalf as well as through our buying agents.

DISTRIBUTION

We utilize two facilities for the distribution of our product, both of which are owned and operated by third parties. Virtually all of the merchandise sold in our stores and on our website is first received and processed at a central distribution facility in Columbus, Ohio. From there, merchandise allocated to be sold in stores is shipped to our stores and merchandise to be sold online direct-to-consumer is shipped to a distribution facility in Richwood, Kentucky (the "Richwood Facility"). Merchandise is typically shipped to such stores and to the Richwood Facility via third-party delivery services multiple times per week, thereby providing them with a steady flow of inventory. The third party who operates the Richwood Facility is responsible for fulfilling the majority of the orders placed through our website and shipping the merchandise directly to customers or to stores for pickup, via third-party delivery services. In addition, approximately 330 retail stores have the ability to ship select online merchandise directly to our customers.

privacy, and product safety; laws and regulations with respect to the operation of our stores and business generally, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and laws that apply as a result of being a public company. In addition, we are subject to United States customs laws and similar laws of other countries associated with the import and export of merchandise. 

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES

At Express our brand purpose is to create confidence and inspire self-expression, and our associates are essential to fulfilling that purpose. In order to compete and succeed in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, we must continue to attract and retain talented and experienced employees. To do this, we begin with a comprehensive, Company-wide program called Success@Express that guides our approach to associate performance, potential and succession, and rewards. Success@Express also ensures that each associate’s goals and objectives are aligned with the EXPRESSway Forward strategy.
Associates
We currently employ approximately 10,000 associates. Approximately 800 associates are based at our corporate locations in either Columbus or New York City, approximately 40 are field-based regional and district managers, approximately 1,000 are in-store managers and assistant managers, and approximately 8,000 are in-store sales associates. Approximately 30% of our associates are full-time and the remaining 70% are part-time. None of our associates are represented by a union. We believe our relations with our associates are good. 
Values
Because we believe that culture influences how an organization operates, and the way associates show up and treat one another, early in 2020, we introduced new workplace values and associated behaviors.
Express Yourself
◦Be bold, but not intimidating
◦Be open and share your point of view
◦Be passionate about the brand, the business and the team
◦Be your most authentic self
Express Together
◦Accept and respect each associate for who they are and how they contribute
◦Encourage candor, invite dialogue and listen to points of view that differ from your own
◦Build trust and productivity within your team and across functions by assuming positive intentions and respecting subject matter expertise
◦Contribute your time and resources to the well-being of our communities and our planet
Express Success
◦Recognize your role in delivering results
◦Understand what you must do or what help you may need in order to achieve your goals
◦Hold yourself accountable for the quality and consistency of your work
◦Offer and accept constructive feedback with kindness and respect
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
In the Spring of 2020, we revisited the subject of Diversity & Inclusion (“D&I”) at Express to ensure that our work here was aligned with our corporate strategy, brand purpose and values. We expanded the definition and scope of this work to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion ("DE&I") and made the following changes to reflect this expansion:
▪The Diversity & Inclusion Steering Committee was renamed the DE&I Stewards to reflect their sense of ownership and accountability for driving this work forward, and the Diversity & Inclusion Council was renamed DE&I Ambassadors to reflect their role in building greater awareness and understanding of this work 
▪We developed a DE&I charter that includes a vision and mission to define our aspirations, and a set of objectives to guide our priorities and initiatives
EXPRESS, INC. | 2020 Form 10-K | 10


Table of Contents

▪Our Vision is: To create a culture where associates, customers and partners can feel confident and supported being their genuine selves, and our Mission is: To seek out, respect and embrace different experiences, approaches and points of view
▪The DE&I Stewards and Executive Leadership Team are driving the realization of this work across all of our functional areas and ensuring that we embed best practice DE&I thinking into everything that we do
Compensation and Benefits
The compensation and benefits component of the Success@Express program is designed to attract and reward individuals who demonstrate the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our shareholders. We provide associates with compensation packages that include base salary and may also include annual incentive bonuses and/or long-term incentive awards depending upon the associate’s level. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns associate and stockholder interests. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer associates benefits such as life and health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, and a 401(k) plan, of which we match 4.0% of contributions.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our associates as well as the communities in which we operate. This includes having the vast majority of our corporate associates work from home while also implementing a number of safety measures for associates continuing critical on-site work. During this time we also introduced Flex@Express which empowers associates to work with their leaders to create flexible work arrangements that best balance their personal and professional commitments.
Community Involvement
We believe that giving back to the communities where our associates live and work is the right thing to do, and also supports our efforts to attract and retain the most talented and experienced employees. 
To further fulfill our brand purpose we launched the Express Dream Big Project ("Dream Big") in 2020. This is an ongoing fundraising initiative created to champion organizations that empower people to believe in themselves and follow their dreams. This program is a way to unify and align our corporate philanthropy and employee giving in a way that is tightly connected to our brand purpose.
During the Fall season, we partnered with the GoFundMe Small Business Relief Fund to encourage our customers and associates to help us raise money for entrepreneurs who’ve been hit hardest by COVID-19. We matched customer donations up to $50,000 on Small Business Saturday and Giving Tuesday. Looking ahead to 2021, our first Dream Big partnership will be with the NAACP Empowerment Programs whose mission is to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate racial hatred and discrimination.

SEASONALITY

Our business is seasonal. We define our seasons as Spring, which includes the first and second quarters, and Fall, which includes the third and fourth quarters. Historically, we have realized a higher portion of our net sales and net income in the Fall season due primarily to the impact of the holiday season. Generally, approximately 45% of our annual net sales occur in the Spring season and 55% occur in the Fall season. In 2020, this split was approximately 38% were generated in the Spring season and approximately 62% were generated in the Fall season as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related store closures in the Spring season. Cash needs are typically higher in the third quarter due to inventory-related working capital requirements for early Fall and holiday selling periods. Our business is also subject, at certain times, to calendar shifts, which may occur during key selling periods close to holidays such as Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

CORPORATE HISTORY

We opened our first store in 1980, in Chicago, Illinois as a division of The Limited, Inc., now known as L Brands, Inc., and launched our men’s apparel line in 1987, which was rebranded under the name Structure in 1989. In 2001, we began to consolidate our separate women’s and men’s stores into combined dual-gender stores under the Express brand. In 2007, Golden Gate Capital acquired 75% of the equity interests in our business from an affiliate of Limited Brands, Inc., and we began to operate as a standalone company. In May 2010, the Company converted to a Delaware corporation, held an initial public offering, and listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Subsequent to our initial public offering, Golden Gate Capital and Limited Brands, Inc. sold their remaining interests in the Company and are no longer affiliated with Express.
