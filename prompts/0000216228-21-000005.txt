Other Company Information
Materials
All of our businesses require various manufactured components and raw materials, the availability and prices of which may fluctuate.
MANUFACTURED COMPONENTS ASSEMBLED INTO OUR PRODUCTS
• Motors | • Castings 
• Mechanical Seals | • Machined Castings 
• Metal Fabrications | • Miscellaneous Metal, Plastic, and Electronic Components


PRIMARY RAW MATERIALS 
• Steel | • Gold | • Copper | • Nickel
• Iron | • Aluminum | • Tin | • Rubber
• Specialty Alloys, including Titanium | | 

Raw materials are purchased in various forms, such as sheet, bar, rod and wire stock, pellets, and metal powders. We also use various specialty resins and adhesives. Raw materials, supplies and product subassemblies are purchased from third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers, and commodity dealers. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply, or such materials are readily available. However, in some instances we depend on a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly, or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to a limited number of suppliers.
We continually monitor the business conditions of our supply chain to maintain our market position and to avoid potential supply disruptions. There have been no raw material shortages that have had a material adverse impact on any such business as a whole, and we have been able to develop a robust supply chain such that we do not anticipate shortages of raw materials in the future. During 2020, we were able to effectively manage supply chain challenges for certain raw materials due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic-related challenges are expected to continue in part in 2021. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be adversely affected by price volatility or the availability of supplies to meet our demands in the future. 
Although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers, our operating results are generally exposed to fluctuations in the prices of raw materials and commodities due to inflation, and tariffs imposed by the U.S. and other countries. When practical, we attempt to control such costs through fixed-priced contracts with suppliers. We typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements for an average of four to eight weeks, with the exception of some specialty materials. From time to time, we experience price volatility or supply constraints for raw materials based on market supply and demand dynamics. In limited circumstances, we may have to obtain scarce components for higher prices on the spot market, which may have a negative impact on gross margin and can periodically create a disruption to production and delivery. We also acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price, and availability of supply. We evaluate hedging opportunities to mitigate or minimize the risk of operating margin erosion resulting from the volatility of commodity prices. 
Manufacturing Methods
Our businesses utilize two primary methods to fulfill demand for products, build-to-order and engineer-to-order. 
•Build-to-order consists of assembling a group of products with the same pre-defined specifications, generally for our OEM customers. We employ build-to-order capabilities to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations.
•Engineer-to-order consists of assembling a customized system according to a customer’s individual order specifications. Engineering products-to-order permits the configuration of units to meet the customized requirements of our customers. 
In both cases, we offer design, integration, test, and other production value-added services. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both build-to-order and engineer-to-order seek to improve customer delivery performance and minimize inventory holding periods.
Intellectual Property
Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and improvements that are likely to be incorporated into our products or where proprietary rights are expected to improve our competitive position. The highly customized application engineering embedded within our products, our proprietary rights, our knowledge capabilities, and our brand recognition all contribute to enhancing our competitive position.
While we own and control a significant number of patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights which, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business, management believes that our Company, as a whole, as well as each of our core segments, is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights. Patents, patent applications, and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. As the portfolio of our patents, patent applications, and license agreements has evolved over a long period of time, we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent or other intellectual property right to have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.
Research and Development
Research and Development (R&D) is key to our strategy and is generally focused on the design of highly engineered solutions. R&D focuses on developing solutions that bring a competitive offering that address clear needs in the market segments we serve. In addition, we work closely with our customers to address their needs by engineering a solution to fit their particular application and enable our customers to achieve their results. We believe R&D is a source of competitive advantage and in recent years, we have invested in new innovation centers of excellence and plan to continue this effort in the future. R&D as a percentage of sales was 3.4% during both 2020 and 2019, and 3.6% during 2018. 
Cyclicality and Seasonality
Many of the businesses in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. We consider our connector products in our CCT segment to be an early cycle business, meaning it generally is impacted in the early portion of an economic cycle compared to our other businesses, while the automotive and aerospace components businesses tend to be impacted in the middle portion of the cycle and the industrial pump business typically is impacted late in the economic cycle.
Our businesses experience limited seasonal variations. Revenue impacts from the limited seasonal variations are typically mitigated by our backlog of orders that allow us to adjust levels of production across different periods.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to stringent federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions, water discharges and waste disposal. In the U.S., these include, but are not limited to, the Federal Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Environmental requirements are significant factors affecting our operations. We have established an internal program to assess compliance with applicable environmental requirements at our facilities. The program, which includes periodic audits of many of our locations, including our major operating facilities, is designed to identify problems in a timely manner, correct deficiencies and prevent future noncompliance. ITT's environmental liabilities are, for the most part, not associated with current operating facilities (only 2 of ITT's 27 locations with environmental liabilities are current operating sites). Additionally, ITT’s diligent approach to remediation has resulted in a reduction in the number of environmental matters by approximately 50% over the past 6 years.
We closely monitor our environmental responsibilities, together with trends in environmental laws. In addition, we have purchased insurance protection against certain environmental risks arising from our business activities. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change, and the nature and timing of such changes, if any, is difficult to predict. As actual costs incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from our current estimates given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures, management believes it is possible that the outcome of these uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" within Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, as well as Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters.
Human Capital Management
In order to continue innovating in the industries we serve, ITT remains committed to attracting and retaining top talent. We strive to make ITT a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace for all, and create a high-performance culture with opportunities and training for employees to develop and grow professionally and personally. In addition, we 
offer competitive compensation, benefits, and health and wellness programs. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 9,700 employees located in 35 countries, including 2,600 employees in the U.S. 
Corporate Governance and Oversight
We believe that the success of our business is tied to the strength of our human capital. In order to foster a high-performance culture, we are committed to recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, performance management, and professional development. To facilitate oversight of these matters, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) is composed of highly experienced and diverse individuals. The role of the Board is to oversee the affairs of the Company, including those pertaining to human capital, and to ensure the overall success of the business. The Board and our executive leadership team are committed to creating and adhering to policies and practices that will help attract, retain, and develop a workforce that aligns with our strategies and values. The Board and executive leadership team also work closely together to evaluate human capital areas, such as those involving workplace health, safety, and well-being; and to implement measures to support these areas. 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion are critical business priorities for ITT. We value and leverage the differences that make each of us unique. We are focused on demonstrating our commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion through our actions, including creating an environment where all ITTers are able to fully engage and achieve their potential, and freely share ideas to guide us toward more innovative thinking and better business decisions and solutions. We value diversity in our employee population, including diversity in race, religion, gender, disability, nationality, age, sexual orientation, ethnic background, and more. For additional information along with our diversity metrics and statistics, please refer to our June 2020 Sustainability Supplement report found on our website. We firmly believe that we will create more success by leveraging our collective know-how and continuously learning from each other's diverse ideas, opinions and experiences. We believe that creating a diverse environment allows us to generate bold thinking that will sustain and propel our success in the global marketplace and create long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders. 
Labor Practices and Policies
At ITT, we strive to treat all employees equitably and are committed to maintaining fair labor practices around the world. We adhere to the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Some of these principles are summarized below. 
•ITT respects employees’ right to bargain collectively within the requirements of the law, and we partner closely with union leaders to address labor issues at our sites.
•ITT pays its employees fair and competitive rates and provides competitive benefits. 
•ITT fully adheres to the ILO Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, which calls on countries and companies to abolish child labor. 
ITT fully supports and adheres to the principles of both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Global Compact everywhere we operate. 
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 21% of our U.S. employees are represented by unions. No one unionized facility accounted for more than 12% of ITT's total revenues. In addition, many of our global employees are covered by collective agreements or represented by works councils or other groups. Our relations with our employees are strong and we have not experienced any material strikes or work stoppages in the past several years.
Health, Safety, and Well-being
At ITT, the health, safety, and well-being of our employees is our number one priority. Our Environmental, Safety, Health and Security (ESH&S) team provides for the systemic control of workplace risks and drives continual improvement of environmental and occupational safety and health protocols at all our sites around the world. We challenge ourselves to continually reduce injury frequency and severity by engaging employees in our “Accept Only Zero” safety accountability system and fostering an environment where employees take responsibility for their actions and have access to tools and training to work safely together. Our focus on employee safety has resulted in a 25% decline in recordable incidents in 2020 as compared to the prior year, as well as a reduction in workers' compensation expenses in the United States.
Talent Development
We invest significant resources to develop our talent and to remain a worldwide leader in the manufacturing of highly-engineered customized products and solutions. We foster employee growth and development by providing numerous training opportunities across the globe and by engaging in periodic talent reviews and in-depth succession planning sessions globally. Our talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals and to build strong management and leadership skills. 
Compensation and Benefits
We provide flexible compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to base salaries, we offer numerous benefits for certain eligible employees, including annual bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs, and tuition reimbursement. With respect to stock awards, we have used discretionary equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate the retention of key personnel, particularly those identified as high-performing talent.
