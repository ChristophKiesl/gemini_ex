 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 Momentive Global Inc., formerly SVMK Inc., is a leader in agile experience management, providing Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) solutions that help businesses shape what's next for their stakeholders. Our software enables our customers to collect, analyze, and act on feedback from their existing customers, prospective customers, and employees. More than 345,000 organizations rely on us to help deliver better customer and product experiences, increase employee engagement and retention, and unlock growth and innovation.
 We are transforming from our roots as a provider of digital survey tools sold through the Internet to an enterprise SaaS company that leverages both product-led and sales-led go-to-market motions. In 2021, approximately 32% of our total revenue was generated from customers who purchased software through our enterprise sales force, up from 29% in 2020. To help us engage more deeply with enterprise sales customers, we rebranded ourselves as “Momentive” in June 2021 and changed our legal name from “SVMK Inc.” to “Momentive Global Inc.” As a result, our common stock began trading under the ticker symbol “MNTV” instead of “SVMK” on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. While Momentive is our new corporate name, we continue to use the “SurveyMonkey” and “GetFeedback” brands.
 We offer artificial intelligence-powered solutions that help our customers reshape their businesses across five major categories of use cases: 1) Market Insights; 2) Brand Insights; 3) Customer Experience; 4) Employee Experience; and 5) Product Experience. We deliver these solutions through three major product categories—Surveys (SurveyMonkey), Customer Experience (GetFeedback CX), and Market Research (Momentive).
 Proposed Merger with Zendesk
 On October 28, 2021, we entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Zendesk, Inc. ("Zendesk") and Milky Way Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Zendesk (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into us (the “Merger”), with our company surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Zendesk. Our board of directors and the board of directors of Zendesk have each approved the Merger Agreement and the Merger.
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each outstanding share of our company's common stock (the "Momentive Shares") (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement) will be converted in the Merger into the right to receive 0.225 (the “Exchange Ratio”) of a share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Zendesk ("Zendesk Shares"), with a cash payment for any fractional shares resulting from the calculation. The Merger is intended to qualify as a “reorganization” for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 The completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of each of our stockholders and the Zendesk stockholders. For further information on the Merger and the Merger Agreement, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the definitive proxy statement filed by us on January 7, 2022 and first mailed to our stockholders on January 10, 2022.
 Impact of COVID-19
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the United States and the world. As a result, we have modified certain aspects of our business, including restricting employee travel, requiring employees to work from home, transitioning our employee onboarding and training processes to remote or online programs, and canceling certain events and meetings, among other modifications. We continue to actively monitor and evaluate the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and stockholders. The effects of these operational modifications are unknown and may not be realized until further reporting periods. We continue to evaluate and refine our return to office strategy and real estate needs. When we reopen our offices, we will offer most of our employees the flexibility to determine the amount of time they work in our offices, subject to vaccination status.


Although many jurisdictions have relaxed their guidelines and restrictions, in some cases, these have been, or may in the future be, reinstated. The full impact of the rapidly changing market and economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain as the businesses of our customers and partners have been, and in some cases continue to be, disrupted. We have experienced a more challenging enterprise sales environment, longer sales cycles, and an increase in attrition rates, particularly among customers in segments and industries more severely impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as travel and hospitality. In addition, some of our existing and potential customers are financially constrained in their ability to purchase our products, which we expect may negatively impact our ability to collect payments, acquire new customers, or renew subscriptions with or sell additional subscriptions to our existing customers. We expect such impacts on our revenue and costs to continue through the duration of this crisis and our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition could also be impacted. While we have not experienced significant disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity and spread of new or existing variants of the virus between regions, changes in infection and vaccination rates in each region, the duration of the pandemic globally and regionally, additional actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the businesses of our customers and partners, individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact our financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations is uncertain, and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods, even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided. We are continuously evaluating the nature and extent of the impact to our business, including our reopening plans, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.
 Our Products
 Our products address business use cases across five major categories:
 •Market Insights: We generate market intelligence -- including industry tracking, competitive intelligence, buying patterns by customer segment -- with insights delivered quickly and cost efficiently;
 •Brand Insights: We identify brand attributes that resonate with a company’s target audience, such as longitudinal tracking of brand awareness and loyalty, pre-campaign ad creative testing, and ad campaign brand lift measurement; 
 •Product Experience: We help companies build and sell more products their customers love, such as concept and packaging testing, pricing optimization, and feature importance;
 •Customer Experience: We help companies engage and retain their customers, including programs to measure and optimize net promoter score ("NPS"), customer satisfaction ("CSAT"), and customer effort scores ("CES"), as well as a customer’s experience with a company’s website, mobile app, and events; and
 •Employee Experience: We help companies understand and engage their employees and build a better workplace, addressing areas such as employee engagement and retention, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI"), candidate experience, return to work, and performance management.
 We offer three experience management product categories—Surveys, Customer Experience, and Market Research—which are summarized below. We believe our products are differentiated in the market due to their ease-of-implementation, ease-of-use, price relative to alternatives, and ability to integrate with our customers’ third-party systems of record. Today, we offer certain tiers of our Surveys and Market Research product categories on a self-serve basis through our website, and we offer a suite of enterprise-grade experience management solutions from all three product categories through a direct sales force. We generate revenue from these offerings either on a subscription or transactional basis, depending on the product. We believe that these three product categories, combined with our emerging sales-led go-to-market motion, will enable us to continue to increase our penetration of enterprise customers.
 Surveys
 Our Survey Platform


Our leading survey software products, branded under SurveyMonkey, enable our customers to listen and take action on stakeholder feedback. We have designed products that optimize the quality of stakeholder feedback and maximize response rates to help our customers improve customer experiences, develop a diverse and high-performing workforce, and grow their business. Our platform provides functionality that supports our survey products, including:
 •Templates: Our library of customizable survey templates and certified questions, designed by a team of survey scientists, facilitates an easy-to-use and methodologically-sound survey creation process;
 •Ease-of-Use: Our products are flexible and easy to use, which enables individuals and organizations of all sizes to collect and analyze stakeholder feedback. Our survey platform leverages SurveyMonkey Genius, our proprietary survey creation assistant, which uses insights extracted from our diverse data set to guide and optimize survey creation;
 •Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Our platform leverages artificial intelligence and proprietary machine learning models that increase survey and response quality, and deliver actionable insights faster. SurveyMonkey Genius helps customers ask the right questions the right way, predicting response rates and time to complete a survey. Text analysis features such as Word Cloud visualizations and Sentiment Analysis take the time out of analyzing open-ended survey responses, providing instant insights into what respondents think and feel;
 •Analysis: Our products enable the filtering and comparison of data by cohort, geography, gender, time period, collection method, and more. We help customers weave together data to form a narrative that answers the “why,” which enables them to better understand customer and employee attitudes, predict market appetite, and identify meaningful opportunities more quickly; and
 •Integrations: Our products integrate with a customer’s existing systems of record, allowing them to act on the insights we deliver in the systems they already use to get work done. This allows our customers to improve retention and satisfaction of their customers, maximize employee engagement and retention, and tailor new products to the demands of prospective customers, among other things. SurveyMonkey products also integrate with business applications.
 Individual Plans
 We offer our “Basic” survey plan to individuals at no charge. We also offer multiple tiers of subscriptions to individual paying users through our self-serve channel, with pricing based on functionality, including: advanced survey logic; branding and customization tools; analysis features; and support options.
Business Plans
 SurveyMonkey team plans: Team plans are designed for small teams and departments that need to collaborate on survey projects. In addition to the features available in paid plans for individuals, SurveyMonkey team plans provide advanced collaboration features for survey creation and analysis, centralized team administration, and a team library for survey themes, templates and brand assets. Team plans start at three users per team, billed annually on a subscription basis, and include flexible roles and pricing for survey creators and analysts. Team plans are sold primarily through our self-serve channel as well as through our enterprise sales channels.
 SurveyMonkey Enterprise: For organizations, we offer SurveyMonkey Enterprise, which extends our survey platform with enterprise-grade security and an enhanced set of capabilities (including managed user accounts, customized company branding, collaboration capabilities, and deep integrations with a broad set of leading software applications) that enable users to support multiple, advanced feedback use cases across the organization. Features include:
 •Enterprise-Grade Security: We provide centralized data ownership and access management across accounts with encryption and compliance with key standards, including ISO 27001, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”) and the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). We have also achieved SOC 2 Type 2 certification for our SurveyMonkey and GetFeedback platforms to meet the requirements of large, global customers across industries, including the defense, financial services and healthcare sectors; 


•Integration and Compatibility: We also offer pre-built integrations and data portability with applications such as those offered by Salesforce, Marketo, Tableau, Microsoft, and Oracle – allowing for greater workflow automation and operationalized feedback programs;
 •Managed Accounts and Users: Our survey platform enables organizations to centrally manage users and teams. Within an organization, all survey accounts can be consolidated under a single corporate identity to centralize billing, administration, restrictions and defaults, and access management; and
 •Collaboration: Users can create and share surveys between and within departments allowing others to review, add comments and make edits. Teams gain access to a shared library that ensures consistent organizational branding and survey methodology across all team member accounts, utilizing the images, themes, style preferences and templates that fit an organization’s preferences, as well as corporate question bank to ensure consistency across surveys.
 SurveyMonkey Enterprise is sold through our enterprise sales team. We negotiate deployments with organizations based on functionality, the number of users, and the volume of data collected.
 Revenue from Surveys is generated primarily on a subscription basis.
 Customer Experience
 Our Customer Experience offering, the GetFeedback CX platform ("GetFeedback CX"), enables companies to leverage in-the-moment customer feedback to deliver exceptional experiences that engage and retain their customers. GetFeedback CX simplifies customer feedback collection and analysis, its integration with customer relationship management (“CRM”) data to help companies better understand key customer segments, and its accessibility within the systems companies already use to help them take action quickly in service of their customers. GetFeedback CX captures a company’s customer feedback from across key digital channels and within offline or proprietary business systems, combines this feedback with operational customer data to build a deeper understanding of their customers and their preferences, and automates feedback-based actions through integrations with that company’s existing system of record and other key business systems. We differentiate our customer experience offering in the market based on our software’s ease-of-implementation and use time-to-value relative to alternative solutions, and rich integration across the Salesforce ecosystem.
 GetFeedback CX consists of products acquired through the acquisitions of Usabilla (April 2019) and GetFeedback (September 2019) and includes updated features, such as:
 •Open text & sentiment analysis: Leverages Momentive’s artificial intelligence engine to analyze open text responses and quickly understand customer sentiment which enables companies to gain insights quickly from large amounts of unstructured text-based feedback. The feature identifies the top keywords and analyzes the sentiment of phrases within open text responses (beta);
 •Automations layer & webhooks: Expedites the setup of custom, targeted alerts and actions that automatically push customer feedback and its associated metadata across an organization via email or through systems like Salesforce or Slack. Webhooks extends these automations across any system that can ingest them, enabling companies to push feedback across even more of its tech stack to drive action that help engage and retain customers;
 •Embedded listener: Enables companies to leverage a simple application programming interface (“API”) to collect feedback through any proprietary system (ATM, kiosk, Smart TV, etc.) while adhering to a company’s strict brand and security standards;
 •Slack integration: Streamlines feedback response and follow up within Slack to help companies reduce their customer response times. This feature enables companies to create conditions for when Slack notifications are sent based on specific customer feedback, and then push this feedback automatically across one or more Slack channels;
 •Enhanced Salesforce integration: Companies can now integrate customer experience data from their websites and mobile apps into Salesforce so they can act on feedback across their entire customer lifecycle;
 •Salesforce Managed App: Automatically push the results of surveys right into Salesforce through a GetFeedback CX app to help drive awareness and accountability for customer experience programs; and


•Program Accelerator: Enables companies to launch recurring customer experience programs, easily and at scale, through turnkey templates. Companies can select customer contacts and pre-built survey and email templates based on customer experience best practices to quickly execute customer experience programs and help drive better customer experiences. We launched the beta version of our NPS sequencer in 2021, and expect to launch additional offerings in 2022.
 We offer the following Customer Experience packages:
 •GetFeedback Essentials: GetFeedback Essentials gives companies the tools to launch customer experience programs quickly by gathering feedback via email and across their websites, analyzing it in one place, and integrating with their Salesforce CRM platform;
 •GetFeedback Pro: Includes the Essentials features and adds more feedback collection channels (SMS and chat), advanced analytics, automation and additional pre-built integrations; and
 •GetFeedback Ultimate: Includes the GetFeedback Pro features and adds mobile apps as a feedback collection channel and enables single sign-on (“SSO”).
 Our Customer Experience offering is sold through our enterprise sales team.
 Revenue from Customer Experience is generated primarily on a subscription basis.

 Our market research solutions bear the Momentive brand and are the underlying software products powering the Momentive Market Insights, Brand Insights, and Product Experience categories of solutions. Our market research offerings enable customers to quickly collect and analyze actionable insights from a targeted audience on a number of market research needs, including analyzing market opportunities, measuring brand and campaign effectiveness, and gaining insights on existing and future product lines.
•Audience panel: Powered by our own proprietary sources as well as integrations with vetted partners, our market research panel solution enables organizations to conduct market research projects from stakeholders with whom they do not have a direct relationship from a representative sample of consumers to a niche group of business-to-business (“B2B”) decision makers. Our Audience panel enables organizations to collect and analyze real‐time actionable data from high-quality targeted panelists. Our panel is directly integrated into our survey platform as well as our market research solutions to allow self-service access to these respondents. 
 •Purpose-built insights solutions: For common, repeatable market research use cases, we have a suite of solutions that streamline the study creation, data collection, and analysis experience into a guided flow.

 Our Customers
 Our global customer base is diversified across multiple industries, including financial services, internet, technology, healthcare, media and entertainment, consumer goods and retail, transportation and logistics, government agencies, manufacturing, energy, education, professional services and non-profit organizations. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 345,000 organizational domain customers, which are customers who register with us using an email account with an organizational domain name such as @momentive.ai or @surveymonkey.com, but excludes customers with email addresses hosted on widely used domains such as @gmail, @outlook or @yahoo. As of December 31, 2021, over 90% of our trailing 12-month bookings were from organizational domain-based customers. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 11,900 customers who purchased our software through our enterprise sales channel. No customer represented more than 10% of our revenue in any of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
Our Growth Strategy
 We are executing on a two-part growth strategy. First, we are delivering new features and product tiers that capitalize on the virality of our platform and the scale of business to drive overall platform usage and increase the conversion of free users to paid subscribers in our self-serve channel. Second, we are investing further in product innovation and go-to-market initiatives to expand the percentage of our revenue generated through our enterprise sales channel. Specifically, our enterprise sales motion focuses on: converting existing self-serve subscribers to enterprise sales customers; selling directly to new customers; and expanding our relationships with existing customers. As we execute on this strategy, we believe we can accelerate our overall revenue growth profile and generate greater levels of free cash flow over time.

Our survey platform is inherently viral, as existing users send surveys and share survey results that introduce potential new users and customers to our products. This virality, combined with the ease-of-use and price-disruptive nature of our products and the strength of our brand, has enabled us to build an efficient, online self-serve channel for selling versions our survey products. Additionally, our user base includes individuals and teams within organizations who are using our software to collect feedback for business use cases related to their employees, current customers, and potential new customers and markets. Thus, our self-serve channel also serves as a renewable source of prospective customers for our sales team to introduce SurveyMonkey Enterprise and our newer Customer Experience and Market Research enterprise product categories. We believe this installed base of organization-based customers represents a significant opportunity to drive new business and expand existing relationships with enterprises, which we believe can increase our revenue growth and customer retention rates over time.
 Self-Serve Initiatives
 Our initiatives to drive continued product-led growth through our self-serve channel include:
 •Optimization of traffic to our website through search engine optimization, search engine marketing and other paid digital marketing programs, and marketing on the end page of surveys deployed;
 •Continued account verification to reduce unauthorized account sharing;
 •Further changes in self-serve product tiers to convert more users of our free “Basic” survey plan into paid subscription plans;
 •Deeper and additional product integrations with popular third-party business applications like Microsoft Teams and Zoom Video Communications to drive increased usage of our survey platform, which helps drive more self-serve product usage and subscriptions and identifies potential customers and SurveyMonkey Enterprise prospects; and
 •Continued scaling of our multi-user SurveyMonkey teams products that enables small groups to collaborate on survey creation and analysis and provides an upsell opportunity for SurveyMonkey Enterprise.
 Enterprise Growth Initiatives
 Our enterprise, or sales-assisted growth strategy starts with our brand recognition, our existing user base within organizations, and use of our technology to identify opportunities to convert active users to paying users, upsell organizations to SurveyMonkey Enterprise and cross-sell our Customer Experience and Market Research solutions. Our goal is to increase our total number of enterprise customers and expand our business with existing enterprise customers over time. As we execute on this strategy, we expect to accelerate our revenue growth rate and increase both monetization and retention within organizations over time.
•Our enterprise growth strategy includes:
 oMining the Base: Analyzing our self-serve customer base to identify and market to prospective purchasers of SurveyMonkey Enterprise and our Customer Experience and Market Research enterprise product categories;
 oExpanding Relationships with Existing Organizational Customers: Once we win business in one functional area of an organization (e.g. human resources), we seek to expand our relationship with other parts of the customer’s organization through up-selling more of the enterprise product category already purchased by the customer and/or cross-selling our other enterprise product categories, depending on the needs of the customer;
 oGo-to-Market: Driving continued increased productivity of our sales team through continued investments in enablement, training, cross-selling, and new pricing models, such as consumption-based pricing to better align our economics with the value we provide customers. We also expect to add new sales team members with experience in selling Customer Experience and Market Research solutions;
 oProduct Innovation: We continue to add new features to SurveyMonkey Enterprise, Customer Experience and Market Research products; and


oPartnerships/Integrations: We plan to increasingly leverage our 100+ existing integrations with platforms offered by Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow, HubSpot, Zendesk, and others to power insights within an enterprise customer’s existing systems of record and drive greater adoption of our enterprise product categories.
 Other Growth Initiatives
 •Expanding our business in key international markets: For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we generated 36%, 35% and 35% of our revenue from customers outside of the United States, respectively, and we see significant opportunity for growth internationally. We are investing in marketing our self-serve products and increasing awareness of our brand, developing a more localized product experience and expanding our international data center presence to improve user experience and website speed, and to provide locally hosted data. We are expanding our international workforce in Dublin, Ireland; Ottawa, Canada; and Amsterdam, the Netherlands across all of our business functions.
 •Selectively pursuing acquisitions: We believe our large user base, extensive data set, integration capabilities and products provide opportunities for us to drive value-added growth through opportunistic acquisitions in key areas such as product, market and geographic expansion.
Our Technology Infrastructure and Operations
 Our products are centered on innovation in the following areas:
 Scalable Data Collection: Data can be collected via iOS and Android mobile apps, web browsers, personalized emails and social media or collaboration platforms such as Facebook Messenger and Slack. In addition, data collection can be programmatically embedded and customized to sit within a customer’s website or mobile app and pop-up invitations. Additionally, we offer access via SurveyMonkey Anywhere, our offline data collection mode and via QR codes.
 Data Storage and Analysis: Our architecture allows us to collect data in multiple geographic locales. Our systems are hosted in U.S. and European regions within Amazon Web Services. In addition, we enable certain accounts to store their SurveyMonkey data in other geographic regions hosted by Amazon Web Services.
 Reliability: We have designed our products to be highly available under peak global load conditions. To enable redundancy and backup, we replicate customer data across multiple data centers in multiple availability zones in each of the U.S. and European regions within Amazon Web Services.
 Security: Our survey platform can be connected to enterprise identity management systems such as Microsoft Active Directory and OKTA and can be configured to enable administrators to automate the management of licenses and system access.
Integration into Customer Systems and Processes: Companies can integrate SurveyMonkey into their systems and processes by using our prebuilt connectors, using one of many third-party applications built on our survey platform, or via a custom integration using our open APIs.
We are focused on research and development to enhance our survey platform, develop new products and features, and improve our infrastructure.
 Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success
 We believe our SurveyMonkey brand is globally synonymous with collecting feedback. We benefit from the virality of our platform, where survey creators increase our exposure organically among the respondents to their surveys, and every person who takes a survey is a potential future customer. In addition, our marketing function supports our sales effort targeted at organizations currently using our survey platform as well as prospective new customers seeking enterprise-grade solutions across our three product categories.
 In our self-serve channel, we conduct direct response marketing and engage and reactivate users through communication channels such as in-product notifications, demand generation campaigns, mobile notifications and lifecycle email marketing. We also create brand awareness through search engine optimization, content marketing, social media marketing, public relations and earned media with partners.
 In our enterprise sales channel, we are building a direct, inside sales team focused on new sales and cross-sales of our SaaS offerings into small, midsize, and large enterprises. To help us engage more deeply with enterprise sales

customers, we rebranded ourselves as “Momentive” in June 2021 and changed our legal name from “SVMK Inc.” to “Momentive Global Inc.”
 Our customer success initiatives include an online knowledge base and help center, localized in 16 languages, as well as phone-based, email-based, and dedicated customer support that correspond to the product tier customers have purchased across our product categories.
Competition
 Competitors in the various product categories we offer include Qualtrics, Alchemer (formerly SurveyGizmo), Typeform, Google and Microsoft in Surveys; Medallia, InMoment and Salesforce surveys in Customer Experience; and Nielsen, Kantar and YouGov in Market Research. We also compete with offline methods of feedback collection, such as pen-and-paper surveys and telephone surveys. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following:
 •ease of use and deployment of applications;
 •quality and timeliness of data and insight generation;
 •product features, quality and functionality;
 •volume of data for benchmarking, data science models and artificial intelligence and machine learning applications;
 •pricing, total cost of ownership and visibility into cost over time;
 •brand awareness and reputation;
 •breadth of customer base and level of user adoption;
 •ability to integrate with other applications and systems;
 •security, reliability and scalability across organizations;
 •flexibility to cover a wide breadth of use cases globally;
 •ability to enable collaboration within teams and across different business lines;
 •effectiveness of sales and marketing;
 •customer experience; and
 •vision for the market and product innovation.
 Some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, marketing and product development resources, larger sales and marketing budgets and resources, broader distribution or established relationships, or lower labor and research and development costs than we have. Our competitors may devote greater resources and time on developing and testing products and solutions, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies or otherwise develop more commercially successful products and solutions than we do.
 Regulatory Matters
 We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding privacy, data protection, data security, data retention and consumer protection, accessibility, sending and storing of electronic messages (and related traffic data where applicable), human resource services, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, intellectual property and the provision of online payment services, including credit card processing, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax regulations, which are continuously evolving and developing. We also have privacy-related terms and guidelines for third-party developers to create applications that connect to our products.
Intellectual Property
 We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had seven issued patents and two pending patent applications in the United States. These patents and patent applications seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business.


Environmental, Social and Governance
 Human Capital Resources
 At Momentive, we are on a mission to Power the Curious. Our employee value proposition is to be: A Place Where the Curious Come to Grow and our values guide us every day. Our goal is to create an environment where everyone—no matter their background—can succeed, feel a sense of belonging, and learn from one another. We believe our team around the world delivers value to our customers and drives our business outcomes, and as such, we make significant investments to attract, retain, grow and develop our employees. As of December 31, 2021, we had about 1,600 employees worldwide, of whom about 600 were based outside of the United States. We are a rapidly growing company and have continued to invest in our workforce, as 37% of our employees have been with us for less than one year and 16% have been with us for more than one year but less than two years as of December 31, 2021.
 Momentive’s workforce development strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People & Places Officer, who reports to the CEO. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight with respect to company-wide organization and talent assessment, employee recruitment, engagement and retention, leadership development, management depth and strength assessment, workplace environment and culture, employee health and safety, and pay equity.
 Culture and Values
 Our team is collaborative, inclusive, and driven to make a positive impact that extends far beyond our office doors. Our core values are Stay Curious, Innovate for Customers, Make it Happen, Trust the Team and Stand for Equality. Our core values help shape our business decisions, define our culture, and inspire our growth. Through our choices, words, and actions, we strive to live our values each and every day. Our value of Stay Curious means curiosity is our superpower, and we embrace a growth mindset; we take risks and we learn from outcomes. Our value of Innovate for Customers means we grow alongside our customers, and to deliver value to them, we understand, we act – and we keep at it. Our value of Make it Happen means our customers, colleagues, and community inspires us to compete, win and give back, and we focus, we act with integrity and we own the results. Our value of Trust the Team means we succeed as one global team, we are accountable to one another, value opinions and communicate with clarity and kindness, and we prioritize health and support one another. Our value of Stand for Equality means we champion diversity and welcome individuality, and together, we create an equitable workplace where each person can truly belong and do their best work.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 We believe that diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) improve employee experience, help us understand and serve our customers better, and make us a stronger business. With the strong support of our CEO and leadership, and true passion from our employees, we strive to be an industry leader, create an inspiring culture and have a positive impact in the communities where we live and work. In fiscal 2021, we hired our first Chief Diversity & Social Impact Officer (“CDSIO”) to lead a dedicated and specialized team in our DEI efforts. We report our DEI initiatives quarterly to our board of directors and relevant committees of our board of directors.
We track our DEI goals rigorously, and our strategy is operationalized through the following elements:
 •Goals and transparency: We take a data-driven approach to DEI, because you can’t change what you don’t measure. We have set short- and long-term goals for increasing the representation of women and racially and ethnically diverse employees (which we define as Black/African-American, Latino/Hispanic, American Indian/Native Alaskan, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and two or more races) in our workforce. We began sharing our diversity goals externally in 2019;
 •Center of Excellence: We have a cross-functional team led by the CDSIO with expertise in enterprise leadership, strategy, human resources and communications all focused on driving a more diverse and inclusive workplace;
 •Employee Resource Groups: Eight employee resource groups bring together team members from all backgrounds and experience and aid in building community across the globe; they empower caregivers, the LGBTQ+ community, the neurodivergent, women and women engineers, and our Black, LatinX and Asian employees; together, they drive awareness, create career development opportunities and serve as a vital resource for our business;


•Diversity, Inclusion, and Impact groups: We have dedicated diversity, inclusion, and impact groups ("DIIGs") in various offices that drive locally relevant events, programming, and training to foster an inclusive work environment in their office and the local community;
 •Engagement: We biannually survey our team to understand their sense of belonging and what changes are needed; 
 •Talent acquisition: We have a diversity sourcing team to help build a pipeline of diverse candidates and invest in programs to support our diversity strategy and initiatives;
 •Accountability: Our board of directors and executives review our progress towards our goals and workforce diversity initiatives at least quarterly.
 As of December 31, 2021:
 •Women constituted 50% of our board of directors, 44% of our total employees, 45% of our leadership roles (director and above roles), and 28% of our technology roles (engineering, product, design, research and analytics, and IT roles); and
 •Our racially and ethnically diverse employees (employees who have self-identified as Black/African-American, Latino/Hispanic, American Indian/Native Alaskan, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and two or more races) represent 20% of our U.S. and Canada employees, 11% of our U.S. and Canada leadership (director and above roles), and 15% of our U.S. and Canada technology roles (engineering, product, design, research and analytics, and IT roles).
Total Rewards
 Our compensation programs are designed to reward and recognize the contributions of employees in support of our mission and strategic goals. We strive to offer competitive total rewards which include: salary, short-term incentives, long-term incentives, benefits, and perks to our team around the globe. Benefits and perks include high-quality medical, dental and vision plans, commuter benefits, financial coaching, legal counsel, retirement plans with company matching, paid time-off, paid parental leave and family support, and global mental health resources.
Learning and Development
 We foster a culture where our employees can learn and grow—from our Goldie Speaker Series with leaders and thinkers from around the world, to online learning opportunities, mentoring programs, manager trainings and career conversations with leaders at the company. We have a culture of continuous feedback, and in lieu of the traditional year end performance reviews, our employees have quarterly GIG (growth, impact and goals) conversations with their managers, which are employee-led meetings held at the start of each quarter to reflect on the growth and impact made in the last quarter and to set goals for the upcoming quarter.
Health and Safety
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused our health and safety efforts on protecting our employees. We swiftly implemented changes, such as having our employees work from home and pausing business travel, that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and the communities in which we operate, and which are aligned with guidance from the relevant authorities and in compliance with government regulations. Additionally, we have announced our intention to transition to a hybrid work environment in which a significant portion of our workforce will work either in-person on a part-time basis or remotely on a permanent basis.
Employee Engagement
 We hold bi-weekly Town Hall meetings to provide our employees updates and insights on the state of our business, to provide a forum for employees to ask questions and engage with executive leadership at the company, and to recognize colleagues and celebrate wins across the company. We also conduct biannual engagement surveys which allow our employees to provide confidential feedback on our culture, employee happiness, company strategy and trust in executive management as well as their direct leaders. We use these survey results to drive our engagement initiatives.
Labor Relations


Our employees in the Netherlands are represented by a works council and none of our other employees are represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are in good standing, as indicated by the results of our internal survey on employee engagement.
Corporate Social Impact
 Through our corporate social impact program, Momentive Together, we act on our convictions to spark meaningful change. Momentive Together is how we put our values into action through philanthropic and community minded commitments. At its heart is our belief that together we can drive real progress for equity, sustainability and social justice – to help improve the world we currently live in and shape a better future for everyone.
Our efforts are centered around three pillars that we believe are imperative for a better world:
 •Educational Equity: Tech companies like ours need to invest in future leaders. All students deserve access to educational programs and resources that will empower them to learn and grow. We pledge to expand opportunities for low-income and underserved early education and secondary students by supporting programs that provide high-value, equitable education.
 •Reshaping the Workforce: Marginalized communities need meaningful access to employment pipelines, mentorship, and career development opportunities. We want to help dismantle and reimagine inequitable systems, while ensuring that everyone has what they need to succeed.
 •Environmental Responsibility: We believe it’s up to us to minimize our organizational and individual impact on the environment. From our real estate and supply chain to our travel decisions, we’re committed to monitoring our greenhouse gas emissions and reducing our carbon footprint.
