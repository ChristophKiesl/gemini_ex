Item 1.  Business
 
Capstone Companies, Inc. is a public holding company organized under the laws of the State of Florida.  The Company designs and markets consumer oriented LED lighting products for distribution globally with a primary focus on the North American markets.  The primary operating subsidiary is Capstone Industries, Inc., a Florida corporation located in the principal executive offices of the Company ("CAPI"). Capstone International Hong Kong, Ltd., or "CIHK", was established to expand its product development, engineering and factory resource capabilities in Hong Kong. Capstone's LED lighting portfolio consists of stylish, innovative and easy to use consumer LED lighting products, including power failure multi-function handheld lights, power failure multi-function nightlights, decorative nightlights, wireless motion sensor lights, remote control battery powered accent lights, remote control outlets, bath vanity lights and outdoor LED fixtures.  The Company's products are sold under CAPI brand name, Capstone Lighting® as well as under a nationally recognized licensed brand named Hoover® Home LED. The Company believes that LED is becoming increasingly more mainstream, and, as such, the Company believes that the component and production costs will continue to lower, which should allow a smaller innovative company like ourselves to capitalize on non-commodity products utilizing LED.  The Company's focus is the integration of LED into most commonly used lighting products in today's home. Capstone is positioned well to participate in these expanded product categories which will fuel the Company's further growth.
 
The Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and increasing shareholder returns by providing innovative products on a global basis that make consumer's lives simpler and safer while delivering growth results to the Company's retail partners.
 
The Company oversees and controls the manufacturing of its products, which are currently made in China by OEM contract manufacturers, through three wholly-owned operating subsidiaries: CAPI, CIHK and CLTL.  Capstone believes it has commercially favorable payment terms with its contract manufacturers which supports the Company's growth.  The Company's direct import business model requires shipments meet minimum order quantity or "MOQ" full container loads from its factories directly to retail customers shipping brokers.   This business model avoids pitfalls resulting from slow moving and obsolete product inventories.  The Company's products are built to fill backlog orders and are not warehoused for domestic replenishment programming.  CIHK continually evaluates its contract manufacturers' ability to meet the Company's growing needs.  Additionally, all manufacturers must meet rigorous compliance, security and equipment evaluation audits to ensure competitive pricing for the highest quality products.  The Company continues to explore alternative manufacturing sources in China and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim as part of its ongoing supply chain strategic planning.
 
Business Strategy
 
The global LED lighting market is undergoing a perceived significant transition driven by rapid adoption of energy efficient LED lighting products.  LED lighting products offer numerous advantages for the user which are driving demand (improved light quality, durability, longer life, cooler temperatures, lower cost of operation). These advantages in addition to increased regulatory requirements banning inefficient lights   have accelerated growth of LED products and are expected to continue to accelerate the adoption of energy efficient LED technologies going forward.  According to Allied Market Research, September 2014 the global LED market is forecasted to grow to $42 billion by 2020.
 
The Company entered the LED consumer market eight years ago. At that time, it was clear to management that there was a significant opportunity for an innovative low cost LED product supplier as the lighting industry was on its transition path from traditional lighting technologies to LED.
 
Capstone was an early integrator in the introduction of lower cost LED lighting solutions that have distinctive aspects to create greater appeal to consumers.  The Company's product lines consist of decorative lighting, outdoor fixtures, lighting with built-in power failure technology and safety and security.  The power failure lighting and security products were initially sold under its wholly – owned subsidiary Capstone Industries' brand name through 2015.

As the Company initially entered the market with products branded Capstone LightingÒ, the Company was able to stay under the radar and avoid direct competition with the larger brands that were focused on light bulbs and commercial lighting.  The strategy was to establish the Company's products in the marketplace, building on retail success and user satisfaction.
 
Commencing in 2014, Capstone explored and researched branding opportunities that would allow the Company to differentiate from its own Capstone LightingÒ brand.  The underlying strategy enabled Capstone to effectively provide product to competing retailers within the same channel.
 
Through product differentiation and a visibly recognized brand launched in 2015, HooverÒ Home LED became a Capstone success story.  The Company secured the North America trademark license for the Hoover® brand for LED lighting products.  The HooverÒ name is a 100-year-old household iconic brand name. Hoover® is a registered trademark of Techtronic Floor Care Technology Limited.
 
Moreover, in 2014 Capstone also acquired the exclusive license and sub-license to an advanced power failure technology.  The Company's proprietary technology is referred to as Capstone Power Control or CPC.  It is a patented technology and the U.S. patents were issued August of 2016.  The CPC was developed over a two-year period by a group of MIT PhD Engineers operating as AC Kinetics. This technology can potentially be incorporated into a host of products.
 
In the latter part of 2014, the Company concluded that conventional retail was going to undergo significant change in its LED product and vendor selections resulting from swift retail pricing adjustments.  Early LED products particularly light bulbs, that were deemed early technologies were seen by the Company as too expensive and no longer appropriate for the market.  The early products did not look like light bulbs and were not marketed effectively in the opinion of the Company. As such, buying an LED light bulb was potentially confusing to the consumer.  Over the course of the next year, retail prices for early LED products plummeted and negatively impacted the supply chain.  Capstone forecasted this outcome and determined to focus its primary marketing approach towards the warehouse club channel where low retail mark-ups circumvented this market condition.  The Company was timely in this strategic market entry and benefited from the limited number of vendors competing in this arena.  The Company concluded that larger LED bulb suppliers were concerned with protecting retail price positions and they could not, as such, effectively market their brands in both conventional retail channels and warehouse club channels.
 
Over the course of the next three years, Capstone believes that it has effectively positioned itself in this channel and posted successive revenue growth while delivering strong gross margins.  The Company is currently expanding its distribution into international home improvement centers that accept Capstone's direct import model.  The Company is distributing Capstone Lighting, Hoover® Home LED and will offer private label programming to international accounts where the Company's brands are less relevant.
 
Capstone's 2013 investment in AC Kinetic Technologies, an Armonk, New York technology development company, allowed the Company to develop certain innovative concepts that the Company conceived and that are complex and has yielded intellectual property that we believe will further distinguish the Company's products from other off-the-shelf products commonly marketed at the retail level.  The Company will exploit the patented technologies developed and completed by AC Kinetic Technologies within the Company's own products, both labeled under "Capstone" and under the Hoover® Home LED brand.
 
Perceived or Essential Strengths.
 
Capstone's core executive team has been working together for over three decades and has successfully built and managed other consumer product companies.  CIHK resident management team has extensive experience with low cost off shore OEM manufacturing and is led by an industry leader that has provided sourcing and procurement services to such recognized companies as Circuit City and Dicks Sporting Goods.  Operating Management's extensive experience in hardline product manufacturing and marketing prepared the Company for its entry into the LED market.

From a market perspective, Capstone's branding strategy is focused on establishing multiple trusted brands allowing for a broader reach into various channels.  Capstone Lighting® (2008), Hoover® Home LED (2015) contribute to expanding the Company's retail position.  All two brands are currently available in the marketplace.
 
The Company's product characteristics are supposed to satisfy the following standards:
 
 
· | Designed to make everyday tasks or usage simpler and more enjoyable for consumers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | While continuing to focus on increased profit margins, the products must be affordable to win at the point of sale and deliver increased revenues for retail partners;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The products must represent significant value when compared with items produced or marketed by competitive consumer product companies; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Wherever feasible, the products must be unique to the market whether this be accomplished though design techniques, added functionality or some proprietary innovation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



With respect to the Company's goal of sustained profitability, the challenge has been and remains to achieve greater profit margins from our product lines by either innovative product that induce consumers to pay a higher purchase price or increased efficiencies in producing and selling products that sustain attractive pricing.  This challenge confronts many consumer product companies. Capstone believes that appropriate use of OEM capabilities in innovation and production coupled with design that appeals to consumers are critical factors in meeting this challenge, especially for a smaller or niche competitor.
 
Due to the extensive, modern manufacturing, design and engineering capabilities with the Company's contract manufacturers, and the lower unit costs in China, Capstone believes that it is more economical and efficient to continue to manufacture certain products in China and have them shipped to the United States rather than to have such products produced in North America.  While this resource is available to and used by large numbers of U.S. companies, including our competitors, the Company believes this Chinese manufacturing resource gives the Company the level of innovation, production cost and quality that allows Capstone to be competitive with larger competitors in the United States.  However, as design technologies can influence the degree of hand labor in building its future products, the Company expects the advantages it has realized by manufacturing solely in China to be challenged.  The Company periodically evaluates alternative OEM manufacturing within and outside the Pacific Rim.
 
The Company has expanded CIHK's operations in Hong Kong, with personnel experienced in engineering and design, product development and testing, product sourcing, international logistics and quality control.  These associates work with our OEM factories to develop and prototype new product concepts and to ensure products meet consumer product regulations and rigorous quality control standards.  All products are tested before and during production by Company personnel.  This team also provides extensive product development, quality control and logistics support to our factory partners to ensure on time shipments.  In anticipation of 
 possible Company growth, we have continued our investment in CIHK in an effort to ensure overseas factory performance meets stringent operational tolerances to maintain our competitiveness and operational excellence.
 
Products and Customers
 
The Company has expanded its product positioning through the introduction of more indoor and new outdoor lighting programs both under the "Capstone Lighting®" brand and the Hoover® Home LED brand and other brands as acquired.  Capstone has also expanded hardwired solid state products to its programs in addition to the existing battery and induction powered product lines, through the expansion of bath vanity fixtures and outdoor LED Gooseneck Lanterns.  Such expansion involves the inherent risk of increased operating and marketing costs without a corresponding increase in operational revenues and profits.

The Company has established product distribution relationships with numerous leading international, national and regional retailers, including but not limited to: Amazon, Bunnings, Costco Wholesale, Home Depot, Home Pro, Sam's Club, The Container Store and Wal-Mart. These distribution channels may sell the Company's products through the Internet as well as through retail storefronts and catalogs/mail order.  The Company believes it has developed the scale, manufacturing efficiencies, and design expertise that serves as the foundation for aggressive pursuit of niche product opportunities in our largest consumer markets and growing international market.  While Capstone has traditionally generated the majority of its sales in the domestic U.S. market, urbanization, rising family incomes and increased living standards abroad have spurred a perceived demand for small consumer appliances internationally. To capture this market opportunity, the Company has expanded its international sales by leveraging relationships with our existing global retailers and by strengthening our international product offerings.  CIHK assists the Company in placing more products into foreign market channels as well.  The Company introduced Capstone brands to markets outside the U.S., including Australia, France, Iceland, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom.  This continues to be a promising distribution channel with international sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, increasing 100% up to $2.4 million from $1.2 million the same period in 2015 and representing 8% of net revenue in 2016 and 92 % of net revenue originating in the United States.
 
Based on Capstone's experience in the industry, the Company's Chinese contract manufacturing resources and focus on well designed, practical products, Capstone believes the Company is well positioned to become a leading manufacturer in the growing LED home lighting and security lighting segments.  The Company's efforts to achieve such a goal are ongoing.  Capstone believes it will maintain its revenue growth because of the ability to deliver unique products on time, the quality reputation of its products, business relationships with Capstone's retailers and the aggressive product expansion strategies currently in place.  Such continued progress depends on a number of assumptions and factors, including ones mentioned in "Risk Factors" below.  Critical to growth are economic conditions in the markets that foster greater consumer spending as well as success in the Company's initiatives to distinguish its brands from competitors by design, quality, and scope of functions and new technology or features.  The Company's ability to fund the pursuit of our goals remains a constant, significant factor.
 
With the Company's branded lighting categories, Capstone has a comprehensive product offering for its niche in the industry.  The Company believes that it will provide retailers with a broad and diversified portfolio of consumer products across numerous product categories, which should add diversity to the Company's revenues and cash flows sources.  Within these categories, Capstone seeks to service the needs of a wide range of consumers by providing products to satisfy their different interests, preferences and budgets.
  The Company believes in its ability to serve retailers with a broad array of branded products and quickly introduce new products to continue to allow Capstone to further penetrate its existing customer bases, while also attracting new customers. The Company's primary, perceived challenge is creating sustained consumer demand for its products in a growing number of markets and attaining sustained profitability, which challenge is complicated by the cost of new product development and costs of penetrating new markets.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
The Company's products are marketed primarily through a direct independent sales force.  The sales force markets the Company's products through numerous retail locations worldwide, including larger retail warehouse clubs, hardware centers and e-commerce websites.  The Company actively promotes its products to retailers and distributors at North American trade shows, but relies on the retail sales channels to advertise its products directly to the end consumer.  All sales activities at major account levels involve direct executive management participation.
 
In order for continued sales growth in the retail market, the Company is focused on expanding its market share at existing accounts by expanding its portfolio of both branded and private label LED lighting products. The Company will also be targeting direct to retail clients through CIHK for products that fall outside Capstone's branded categories but are innovative and preferably exclusive to CIHK.  This should allow for quicker revenue expansion as time consuming product and brand development efforts are the responsibility of the retailer.

Capstone depends on e-commerce efforts of Amazon and other on-line retail customers in lieu of pursuing our own aggressive in-house e-commerce effort.  We believe this reliance on Amazon and other retail customer e-commerce is the most cost efficient and effective approach for the Company. We maintain a Facebook website at https://www.facebook.com/powerfailuresolutions/ and our sales staff may use Social Media from time to time to promote our products and brands.  We have not developed a specific Social Media campaign based on third party sponsors or promoters.  Facebook is a registered trademark of Facebook, Inc.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
Capstone believes that the following competitive strengths have and will continue to serve as a foundation for its business strategy:
 
In North America, the Company is highly recognized in several product categories.  Capstone believes that the specialized nature of its existing niche categories, and the market share that it has provided has allowed us to introduce and launch its expanded LED Home Lighting programs.
 
The Company believes its multiple brand strategy is important in maintaining competitiveness in the marketplace. Capstone Lighting® and Hoover® Home LED have both proven successful in meeting expectations at the point of sale.
 
Capstone's core executive team has been working together for over three decades and has successfully built and managed other consumer product companies.  Operating Management's experience in hardline product manufacturing and marketing prepared the Company for its entry into the LED market.
 
Working Capital Requirements
 
In order to more effectively support retailers in the U.S. domestic markets, so that retailers can quickly replenish their stock and reduce the impact of lost sales as a result of stock outages, the Company, as needed, strategically increases its inventory levels held in its leased Anaheim, California warehouse. Combined with investment in new product molds, product testing and outside certifications, package design work, and further expansion of its design and engineering capabilities in CIHK, the Company may require additional working capital to fund these strategic projects.
 
The market price of CAPC Common Stock hinders the Company's ability to access capital markets, but the enhancement of Company's Common Stock's market price requires, in the Company's opinion, sustained profitability coupled with revenue growth.  Sustained profitability and revenue growth is deemed to be required to attract market maker and institutional support for CAPC Common Stock, which support the Company deems vital to any possible, sustained increase in the market price of our Common Stock.
 
The Company's ability to maintain sufficient working capital is highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results.  Failure to achieve expected operating results could have a material adverse effect on the Company's working capital, ability to obtain financing, and its operations in the future.  However, achieving expected results as accomplished in 2016, has increased working capital, provided the Company with liquidity and has allowed for the repayment of outstanding bank notes and some old related party loans.
 
Continued revenue growth and expanded product launches are critical requirements to ensure the Company's continued growth.  Such projects are never held back because of funding shortfalls.  The Company budgets for such projects and if necessary certain members of the Company's senior management and Board of Directors have supplemented the cash flow needs as required through short term loans.
 
The Company's liquidity and cash requirements are discussed more fully in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.

Competitive Conditions
 
The consumer LED products and small electronics businesses are highly competitive and rapidly evolving markets, both in the United States and on a global basis, as large manufacturers with global operations compete for consumer acceptance and, increasingly, limited retail shelf space.  Competition is influenced by brand perceptions, product performance and value perception, customer service and price.  The Company's principal lighting competitors in the U.S. are Amertac, Energizer, and Feit Electric.  The Company believes private-label sales by large retailers has some impact on the market in some parts of the world as many national retailers such as Costco, Home Depot, Target and Wal-Mart offer lighting as part of their private branded product lines.  Many of the Company's competitors have substantially greater resources and capabilities, including greater brand recognition, research and development budgets and broader geographical market reach.  Competitors with greater resources could undermine Capstone's expansion efforts by marketing campaigns targeting its expansion efforts or price competition.  Moreover, if one or more of the Company's competitors were to merge, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our customer distribution channel.
 
With trends and technology continually changing, Capstone will continue to invest and rapidly develop new products that are competitively priced with consumer centric features and benefits easily articulated to influence point of sale decision making.  Success in the markets we serve depends upon product innovation, pricing, retailer support, responsiveness, and cost management.  The Company continues to invest in developing the technologies and design critical to competing in our markets as evidenced by our investment in Capstone Power Control (CPC) Technology.  Our ability to invest is limited by operational cash flow and funding from third parties, including members of management and the Board of Directors.
 
Research, Product Development, and Manufacturing Activities
 
To successfully implement Capstone's business strategy, the Company must continually improve its current products and develop new LED products with additional functionality to meet consumer's expectations.  The Company's research and development department based in Hong Kong designs and engineers many of the Company's products, with collaboration from its third-party manufacturing partners.  Their focus is to introduce product with technology, increasing functionality, enhanced quality, efficient manufacturing processes and cost reductions.  CIHK also establishes strict engineering specifications and product testing protocols for the Company's contract manufacturers' factories and ensure the factories adhere to all Chinese Labor and Social Compliance Laws.  Under the current political regime in China, sudden and unexpected changes in such laws are possible and could impact the Company's business or financial performance by increasing the cost or ease of conducting business.
 
Capstone's research and development team ensures its proprietary manufacturing expertise by maintaining control over all outsourced production and critical production molds.  In order to ensure the quality and consistency of the Company's products manufactured in China, Capstone uses globally recognized certified testing laboratories such as United Laboratories (UL) or Intertek (ETL) to ensure all products are designed and tested to adhere to each country's individual regulatory standards.  The Company also employs quality control inspectors who examine and test products to Capstone's specification(s) before shipments are released.  CIHK office capabilities have now been expanded to include product development, project management, sourcing management, supply chain logistics, factory compliance auditing, and quality enforcement for all supplier factories located in Hong Kong and mainland China.
 
Capstone will continue to invest in this area as the Company expands the number of products being developed and as it moves into more technical and innovative product categories.  These costs are expensed when incurred and are included in the operating expenses.

Raw Materials
 
The principal raw materials used by Capstone are sourced in China, as the Company orders product exclusively through contract manufacturers in the region. These contract manufacturers purchase components based on the Company's specifications and provide the necessary facilities and labor to manufacture the Company's products.  Capstone allocates the production of specific products to the contract manufacturer the Company believes is more experienced to produce the specific product. In order to ensure the consistent quality of Capstone's products, quality control procedures have been incorporated at each stage of the manufacturing process, ranging from the inspection of raw materials through production and delivery to the customer.  These procedures are additional to the manufacturers internal quality control procedures and performed by Company staff.

· | Raw Materials – Components and supplies are subject to sample inspections upon arrival at the contract manufacturer, to ensure the correct specified components are being used in production.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Work in Process – Our quality control team conducts quality control tests at different points during the product stages of our manufacturing process to ensure that quality integrity is maintained.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Finished Goods – Our team performs tests on finished and packaged products to assess product safety, integrity and package compliance.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Raw materials used in manufacturing include plastic resin, copper, led bulbs, batteries, and corrugated paper. Prices of materials have remained lower and competitive in the last year as a result of lower oil prices and the strengthening U.S. dollar. CAPC believes that adequate supplies of raw materials required for its operations are available at the present time.  CAPC, cannot predict the future availability or prices of such materials.  These raw materials are generally available from a number of different sources, and the prices of those raw materials are susceptible to currency fluctuations and price fluctuations due to transportation, government regulations, price controls, economic climate, or other unforeseen circumstances.  In the past, CAPC has not experienced any significant interruption in availability of raw materials.  We believe we have extensive experience in manufacturing and have taken positions to assure supply and to protect margins on anticipated sales volume.  CIHK is responsible for developing and sourcing finished products from Asia in order to grow and diversify our product portfolio.  Quality testing for these products is performed both by CIHK and by our globally recognized third party quality testing laboratories.
 
Section 1502 of Title XV of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires SEC-reporting companies to disclose annually whether any conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product.  Based on our inquiries to our manufacturers, we do not believe as of the date of such inquiries that any conflict minerals are used in making our products.
 
Distribution and Fulfillment
 
Since January 2015, the Company has transferred its U.S. domestic warehousing and distribution needs to a third-party warehousing facility situated in Anaheim, California.  The warehouse distributor provides full inventory storage, packaging and logistics services including direct to store and direct to consumer shipping capabilities that electronically interface to our existing operations software.  The warehouse distributor provides full ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), Inventory Control and Warehouse Management Systems.  These fulfillment services can be expanded to the east coast in Charleston, South Carolina, if we need to establish an east coast distribution point.  This relationship if required, will allow us to fully expand our U.S. distribution capabilities and services.
Seasonality
 
Sales for household products and electronics are seasonally influenced, with increased purchases by consumers during the key holiday winter season of the fourth fiscal quarter, which requires increases in retailer inventories during the third fiscal quarter.  In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes can create conditions that drive increased needs for portable power and spike power failure light sales.  Many retailers now recognize a storm preparedness period and the Company believes that it is well positioned to gain market share in these sales periods.  The Company's "Power Failure Solutions" products support this growing awareness.   As is true for our lighting products, the Power Failure Solutions faces competition from domestic and international companies, which includes competitors with greater resources, market share and brand recognition.
  11
 
Based on sales history, the LED Home Lighting product offerings are not as influenced by seasonal factors and will provide a more normalized revenue stream during the year.
 
Intellectual Property
 
CAPC subsidiary, CAPI, owns a number of U.S. trademarks and patents which CAPC considers of substantial importance and which are used individually or in conjunction with other CAPC trademarks and patents.  These include the following trademarks: Timely Reader, Pathway Lights, Timely Reader Book lights with Timer and Auto Shut Off and 10 LED - Eco-i-Lite Power Failure Light, 5 LED - Eco-i-Lite Power Failure Light, 3 LED - Eco-i-Lite Power Failure Light, 3 LED Slim Line Eco-i-Lite Power Failure Light, LED Induction Charged Headlight.  We also have a number of patents pending on our Security Motion Activated Lights and Bathroom Vanity Light.  CAPC periodically prepares patent and trademark applications for filing in the United States and China.  CAPC will also pursue foreign patent protection in foreign countries if deemed necessary.  CAPC's ability to compete effectively in the power failure, portable lighting, and LED Home Lighting categories depends in part, on its ability to maintain the proprietary nature of its technology and manufacturing processes through a combination of patent and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements, licensing, and cross-licensing agreements.  CAPC owns a number of patents, trademarks, trademark and patent applications and other technology which CAPC believes are significant to its business. These intellectual property rights relate primarily to lighting device improvements and manufacturing processes.
Value of Patents. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Issued patents or patents based on pending patent applications or any future patent applications may not exclude competitors or may not provide a competitive advantage to us. In addition, patents issued or licensed to us may not be held valid if subsequently challenged and others may claim rights in or ownership of such patents. The validity and breadth of claims in technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, the extent of their enforceability and protection is highly uncertain.
 
Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without paying us. We cannot assure shareholders that our competitors have not developed or will not develop similar products, will not duplicate our products, or will not design around any patents issued to or licensed by us.  We will assess any loss of these rights and determine whether to litigate to protect our intellectual property rights on a case by case basis.
 
We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent, and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights.  We cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or, if necessary, successfully asserted.  There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights, or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights from others to support new product introductions.  There can be no assurance that we
 can acquire licenses under patents belonging to others for technology potentially useful or necessary to us and there can be no assurance that such licenses will be available to us, if at all, on terms acceptable to us.  Moreover, there can be no assurance that any patent issued to or licensed by us will not be infringed or circumvented by others, or will not be successfully challenged by others in lawsuits.  We do not have a reserve for litigation costs associated with intellectual property matters.  The cost of litigating intellectual property rights claims may be beyond our financial ability to fund.
 
As is customary in the retail industry, many of our customer agreements requires us to indemnify our customers for third -party intellectual property infringement claims. Such claims could harm our relationships with customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any intellectual property rights claims against us or our customers, we may be required to cease manufacture of the infringing product, pay damages and expend significant Company resources to defend against the claim and or seek a license.

Information Technology
 
The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems. We rely on those systems to manage our daily operations, communicate with our customers and maintain our financial and accounting records. In the normal course of business, we receive information regarding customers, associates, and vendors.  Since we do not collect significant amounts of valuable personal data or sensitive business data from others, our internal computer systems are under a light to moderate level of risk from hackers or other individuals with malicious intent to gain unauthorized access to our computer systems. Cyberattacks are growing in number and sophistication and are an ongoing threat to business computer systems, which are used to operate the business on a day to day basis. Our computer systems could be vulnerable to security breaches, computer viruses, or other events. The failure of our information technology systems, our inability to successfully maintain our information or any compromise of the integrity or security of the data we generate from our systems or an event resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or degradation of services provided by critical business systems, whether by us directly or our third-party service providers, could adversely affect our business operations, sales, reputation with current and potential customers, associates or vendors,  results of operations, product development and make us unable or limit our ability to respond to customers' demands. In addition, our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:

· | hurricanes, fire, flood and other natural disasters;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | power outages
--+--------------


· | internet, telecommunications or data network failure.
--+------------------------------------------------------

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 7 employees in our U.S. office and 7 employees in our Hong Kong operation.  We consider our relations with our employees to be good with none of our employees being subject to collective bargaining agreements.  We have no part-time workers.
 
The following table sets forth the number of employees by function:

Prior History
 
We were incorporated on September 18, 1986 as a Delaware corporation. Our initial public offering under the Securities Act was conducted in 1987.   We started as a blank check company.  From 1986 until the 2006 acquisition of CAPI, we experienced several changes in management, corporate name, and primary business lines, as well as reincorporation from Delaware to Colorado and then from Colorado to Florida in 2004.  We have had a stable management and business line since the acquisition of CAPI in 2006.
 
Acquisition of CAPI:  on September 15, 2006, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with CAPI and Stewart Wallach, the sole shareholder, a director and a senior executive officer of CAPI.  Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of CAPI Common Stock in exchange for $750,000 in cash (funded by the previously reported credit line provided by certain directors of CAPC) and $1.25 million in Series B Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into 1,041,667 "restricted" shares of our Common Stock, $0.0001 par value.   On July 9, 2009, the outstanding Series B Preferred Shares were converted to Series B-1 Preferred Shares.  The Series B-1 shares are convertible into Common Stock; at a rate of 4.444 of common shares for each share of Series B-1. On December 17, 2009, the outstanding Series B-1 shares were converted into common stock.

Available Information
 
We file our financial information and other materials electronically with the SEC.  These materials can be accessed electronically via the Internet at www.sec.gov.  Such materials and other information about the Company are also available through our website at www.capstonecompaniesinc.com.
Government Regulation
 
CAPC's operations are subject to regulation by federal and state securities authorities as well as various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations governing a consumer products company and a for-profit business.  We are not subject to any U.S. federal, state or local regulation that poses, in our opinion, any special or unusual burden or obstacle to conducting our business and financial affairs.  Our main concern in terms of government regulation is the changing regulatory environment in China and its impact on our ability to access our consumer product manufacturing sources and obtain our consumer products.  While the general trend in China has to be conducive to trade and commerce, China is a still a single-party nation-state in which the central government has the power to dramatically and immediately change its trade and commercial policies and laws.  Political or military conflict between the United States and China, who are rivals for power and influence in Asia and to an increasing extent all along the Pacific Rim as well as being diametrically opposed to one another over the status of Taiwan, could provoke a change in Chinese trade or commercial law that makes it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain consumer products.  Such a development would have a serious impact on our ability to compete in the United States in the niche consumer product market.
