ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
We are a leading global chemical and ingredient distributor and provider of value-added services to customers across a wide range of diverse industries. We purchase chemicals and ingredients from thousands of chemical producers worldwide to warehouse, repackage, blend, dilute, transport and sell those chemicals to more than 100,000 customer locations across approximately 125 countries. We operate an extensive worldwide chemical and ingredient distribution network, comprised of more than 600 facilities and serviced by hundreds of tractors, railcars, tankers and trailers operating daily through our facilities.
Chemical and ingredient producers rely on us to warehouse, repackage, transport, and sell their products as a way to expand their market access, enhance their geographic reach, lower their cost to serve, and grow their business. Customers who purchase products and services from us benefit from a lower total cost of ownership, as they are able to simplify their chemical sourcing process by outsourcing functions to us such as “just-in-time delivery,” product availability and selection, packaging, mixing, blending and technical expertise. They also rely on us for safe and secure delivery and off-loading of chemicals compliant with increasing local and federal regulations.
Originally formed in 1924 as a brokerage business and through the continued expansion with various acquisitions, we were acquired in 2007 by investment funds advised by CVC Capital Partners Advisory (US), Inc. and in 2010 by investment funds controlled by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC. We closed our initial public offering on June 23, 2015. As of September 30, 2019, all of the foregoing investment funds had fully divested or reduced ownership in the Company and are no longer considered significant stockholders.
On February 28, 2019, we acquired Nexeo Solutions, Inc. (“Nexeo”), a leading global chemicals and plastics distributor. The acquisition expanded and strengthened our presence in North America and provides expanded opportunities to create the largest North American sales force in chemical and ingredients distribution coupled with a broad and deep product offering. See “Note 3: Business combinations” in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
The effects of market conditions on our operations are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Recent Developments
On September 1, 2020, we sold our industrial spill and emergency response businesses to EnviroServe Inc. and on November 30, 2020, we sold our Canadian Agriculture services business.
On December 18, 2020, we acquired a business of Zhuhai Techi Chem Silicone Industry Corporation (“Techi Chem”), a leading distributor of specialty silicone solutions used primarily for the coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomers (CASE) market within the China marketplace.
At the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company decided to wind down its Canadian Agriculture wholesale distribution business, which was operationally completed by December 31, 2020 when all of the inventory had been sold.
See “Note 3: Business combinations” and “Note 4: Discontinued operations and dispositions” in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
Our Segments
Our business is organized and managed in four geographical segments: Univar Solutions USA (“USA”), Univar Solutions Europe and the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), Univar Solutions Canada (“Canada”), and Univar Solutions Latin America (“LATAM”), which includes developing businesses in Latin America (including Brazil and Mexico) and the Asia-Pacific region. For additional information on our geographical segments, see “Note 23: Segments” in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following graph reflects the breakdown by segment of our 2020 consolidated net sales of $8.3 billion.
USA
We are the largest distributor of commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients with a centralized network in the US. With locations spanning the US, our personnel are strategically located where customers and suppliers need them and are ready to provide agile, reliable support for our customers' business needs. In addition to our broad chemical and ingredients offering, we offer specialized services to a wide range of end markets, touching a majority of the manufacturing and industrial production sectors in the US and all of the Company's end markets. Our Solution Centers provide value-added laboratory services and blending, mixing and packaging capabilities.
Our sales force is deployed through specialized account management across the US to serve our focused customer end markets and through a geographic sales district model to support the local and bulk chemical distribution and services end markets. We repackage and blend bulk chemicals for shipment by our transportation fleet as well as common carriers and utilize our network of terminal and supply locations to optimize bulk shipment deliveries. We believe our close proximity to customers, combined with our extensive product knowledge and end market expertise, serve as a competitive advantage.
EMEA
We maintain a strong presence in the United Kingdom and continental Europe with sales offices in 20 countries. We also have two sales offices in the Middle East and Africa and maintain Solution Centers throughout the EMEA region.
We execute primarily on a pan-European basis, leveraging centralized or shared information technology systems, raw materials procurement, logistics, route operations and the management of producer relationships where possible to benefit from economies of scale and improve cost efficiency. We have strong end market expertise and key account management capability across Europe to better support sales representatives in each country and for serving our key customer end markets, in industrial production, pharmaceutical ingredients, food ingredients, coating and adhesives and personal care.
Canada
Our Canadian operations are regionally focused through sales offices, Solution Centers and distribution sites with a sales force supplying a broad offering of commodity and specialty chemicals and services across a wide range of end markets. In Eastern Canada, we have deep product knowledge in end markets such as food ingredients, beauty and personal care, pharmaceutical ingredients, coatings and adhesives, and chemical manufacturing as well as homecare and industrial cleaning, energy and mining. In Western Canada, our deep end market expertise in forestry and energy (e.g., midstream gas pipeline, oil sands processing and oil refining) complements our offerings across other end markets. While we wound down our agriculture wholesale distribution business at the end of the 2020 season, we remain active in the agriculture end market developing biological crop nutrition solutions for Canadian growers via NexusBioAg.
LATAM 
We offer generic and specialty chemicals and ingredients, as well as technical and market expertise, specialized services and key account management to a wide range of end markets including industrial production, personal care, coatings and adhesives, energy and agriculture through sales offices, Solution Centers and distribution sites in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and to a lesser extent the Asia-Pacific region. With the acquisition of Tagma Brasil Ltda. in 2017, we started to provide formulation services for crop protection manufacturers in Brazil.
Product and End Markets
We source and inventory chemicals and ingredients in large quantities such as barge loads, railcars or full truck loads from chemical and ingredient producers and break down the bulk quantities to repackage, sell and distribute smaller quantities to our customers.
In addition to selling and distributing chemicals, we use our transportation and warehousing infrastructure, along with our broad knowledge of chemicals and hazardous materials handling to provide important distribution and specialized services for our producers and our customers.
We have state-of-the-art Solutions Centers at locations across the globe, consisting of formulation labs, development and research centers, and test kitchens, with specialized industry expertise and innovative technical capabilities to solve our customer's technical challenges and accelerate product development cycles.
In the first quarter of 2020, we organized our product portfolio offering into the following end markets: Industrial Solutions, Consumer Solutions, General Industrial, Refining & Chemical Processing and Services and Other Markets. A further description of these end markets is as follows:
Industrial Solutions
•Coatings and Adhesives. We sell resins, pigments, solvents, thickeners, dispersants and other additives used to make paints, inks, and coatings. Our product line includes epoxy resins, polyurethanes, titanium dioxide, fumed silica, esters, plasticizers, silicones and specialty amines.
•Homecare & Industrial Cleaning. We offer an extensive range of quality ingredients for cleaners, detergents, and disinfectant products. We distribute chemicals manufactured by many of the industry’s leading producers of enzymes, surfactants, solvents, dispersants, thickeners, bleaching aides, builders, sealants, acids, alkalis and other chemicals that are used as ingredients and processing aids in the manufacturing of cleaning and sanitation products. 
•Metalworking & Lubricants. Our broad and diverse range of products include base stocks, performance-enhancing additives for both lubricants and metalworking fluids.
Consumer Solutions
•Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Finished Products. Our portfolio includes products along the medicinal production chain, where we offer a broad portfolio of excipients, solvents, reactants, active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates to pharmaceutical ingredient producers.
•Beauty and Personal Care. We are a full-line distributor in the beauty and personal care industry, providing a wide variety of specialty and basic chemicals and ingredients used in skin and hair care products. 
•Food Ingredients and Products. We distribute a diverse portfolio of commodity and specialty products that are sold into the food industry. The major food and beverage markets we serve are meat processing, baked goods, dairy, grain mill products, processed foods, carbonated soft drinks, fruit drinks and alcoholic beverages. 
General Industrial
•Chemical Manufacturing. We distribute a full suite of chemical products in support of the chemical manufacturing industry (organic, inorganic and polymer chemistries).
•Agricultural. During 2020, in Canada we were a wholesale distributor of crop protection products to independent retailers and specialty applicators. In addition, we provided storage, packaging and logistics services for major crop protection companies. However, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we sold the Canadian Agriculture services business and shut down the Canadian Agriculture wholesale distribution business. This will allow us to focus our efforts in the Canadian agriculture end market on serving growers' crop nutrition needs with inoculants, micronutrients, nitrogen stabilizers and foliar products.
•Industrial and Municipal Water Treatment. We provide the chemistries and products used to sanitize, balance and supplement municipal and industrial water. 
•Forestry, Lumber, Paper. We serve the forest industry in the US and Canada, supplying a complete range of chemical products for use at all stages of production, from sap stain prevention to pulp and paper manufacturing.
•Mining. Within the mining industry in the US and Canada we provide the chemistries necessary to leach ore body as well as balance and manage tailing ponds and mining water sources.
Refining & Chemical Processing
•Energy (up, mid and downstream). We provide chemicals and service to offshore production, midstream pipeline and downstream refinery operators primarily in the US and Canada, including oil sands production. We also service the upstream US shale hydraulic-fracturing sector by providing bulk chemicals to drill sites.
Services & Other Markets
•Chemical Waste Removal. Our ChemCare waste management business collects both hazardous and non-hazardous waste products at customer locations in the US and Canada, and then works with select vendors in the waste disposal business to safely transport these materials to licensed third party treatment, storage and disposal facilities.
•Inventory Management. We manage our inventory in order to meet customer demands on short notice whenever possible. Our value as a channel partner of chemical producers also enables us to obtain access to chemicals in times of short supply, when smaller chemical distributors may not be able to obtain or maintain stock. Further, our global distribution network permits us to stock products locally to enhance “just-in-time” delivery, providing outsourced inventory management to our customers in a variety of end markets.
•Mixing, Blending and Repackaging. We provide a full suite of blending and repackaging services for our customers across diverse industries. Additionally, we can fulfill small orders through our repackaging services, enabling customers to maintain smaller inventories.
•Specialized Formulation and Blending. Leveraging our technical expertise, we are able to utilize our blending and mixing capabilities to create specialty chemical formulations to meet specific customer performance demands for products.
Commodity chemicals and ingredients represent the largest portion of our business by sales and volume. Our commodity portfolio includes acids and bases, surfactants, glycols, inorganic compounds, alcohols and general chemicals used extensively throughout most end markets. Our specialty chemicals and ingredient sales represent an important, high-value, higher-growth 
portion of the chemical distribution market. We typically sell specialty products in lower volumes, but at a higher profit than commodity products.
Suppliers
We source materials from thousands of producers around the globe and we typically maintain relationships with multiple producers in order to protect against disruption in supply and distribution logistics, as well as to ensure competitive pricing of our supply. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our 10 largest producers accounted for approximately 32% of our total chemical purchases.
Distribution Channels
We have multiple channels to market, including both warehouse delivery and direct-to-consumer delivery. The principal determinants of the way a customer is serviced include the size, scale and level of customization of a particular order, the nature of the product and the customer, and the location of the product inventories.
Warehouse distribution
Our warehouse distribution channel is the core of our operations and connects large producers with smaller volume customers whose consumption patterns tend to make them uneconomical to be served directly by producers. Thus, the core customer serviced via our warehouses is a small or medium-volume consumer of chemicals and ingredients. We purchase chemicals and ingredients in truck load or larger quantities from producers based on contracted demands of our customers and our estimates of anticipated customer purchases. Once received, products are stored in one or more of our distribution facilities for sale and distribution in smaller, less-than-truckload quantities to our customers. Our warehouses have various facilities for services such as repackaging, blending and mixing to create specialized solutions needed by our customers in ready-to-use formulations.
Direct distribution
In direct distribution, we sell and service large quantity purchases that are shipped directly from producers through our logistics infrastructure, which provides our customers with sourcing and logistics support services for inventory management and delivery.
Competition
The chemical and ingredient distribution and sales markets are highly competitive. Most of the products that we distribute are made to standard specifications and are either produced by or available from multiple sources. We compete on the basis of service, on-time delivery, product breadth and availability, product and market knowledge and insights, safety and environmental compliance, global reach, product price, as well as our ability to provide certain additional value-added services.
Chemical and ingredient distribution itself is a fragmented market in which only a small number of competitors have substantial international operations. Our principal international competitor is Brenntag, which has a particularly strong position in Europe due to its strong market position in Germany.
Many other chemical distributors operate on a regional, national or local basis and may have a strong relationship with local producers and customers that may give them a competitive advantage in their local market, while others are niche players which focus on a specific end market, either industry or product-based. In addition to Brenntag, some of our regional competitors in North America include Helm America, Hydrite Chemical, Azelis, IMCD and Barentz and some of our regional competitors in Europe include Azelis, Helm, Barentz and IMCD.
Chemical and ingredient producers may also sell their products through a direct sales force, digital marketplace or multiple chemical distributors, limit their use of third party distributors, particularly with respect to higher margin products, or partner with other chemical and ingredient producers for distribution. Each of which could impact our competitive position.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 9,457 employees on a full-time equivalent basis worldwide, with 5,360 represented in the USA, 2,252 in EMEA, 678 in Canada and 1,167 in LATAM. We had 302 senior leaders, nine of which represent executive officers of the Company, and 1,595 people managers. Based on self-identification data, 34.8% of employees are female and 64.3% are male. Of our people managers, 32% are female and 67.5% are male. At the director and above level, 24.2% are female and 75.8% are male. In the US, 17.8% of our people managers are racially and ethnically diverse. Of our 10 members of the Board of Directors, 20% are female, 80% are male, 10% Black/African American and 90% White. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 24% of our labor force is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, including approximately 12%, 46% and 23% of our labor force in the US, Europe and Canada, respectively.
In our efforts to drive continued growth and increased profitability, we are intently focused on building a place that attracts top talent and develops the skills necessary to drive differentiation for our business. We have developed key recruitment and retention strategies that guide our human capital management approach as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies are advanced through a number of programs and initiatives as outlined below:
Employee Hiring Practices. We recruit the best people for the job regardless of race, color, nationality, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation or any other status protected by law and it is our policy to comply fully with all domestic, foreign and local laws relating to discrimination in the workplace.
Employee Compensation. Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with the Company’s performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. We engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry. The Company's executive compensation programs blend base salary, short-term cash incentives and long-term equity awards in a structure that encourages alignment with shareholder interests. We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. Full-time US employees are eligible for health, dental and vision insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, 401(K) plan, life and disability/accident coverage. Employees outside of the US are eligible for a variety of supplemental benefits based on local markets practices and all employees worldwide are eligible for an Employee Assistance Program.
Training and Development. Employees have access to on-demand learning resources for their own professional development on a range of diverse topics such as digital transformation skills, professional effectiveness, diversity, equity and inclusion, business skills, productivity and collaboration tools to leadership development. Our internal programs range from multi-day, instructor-led trainings to short, on-demand eLearning programs. As appropriate, additional training hours are delivered and monitored locally, often focusing on material handling and safety for specific roles. We regularly conduct anonymous employee engagement surveys to gauge our progress and identify the areas where we excel and areas for improvement in the employee experience. The results of these engagement surveys are shared with individual managers, who are then tasked with taking action based on their employees' anonymous feedback.
Performance Management. Career development planning resources are available to all employees. Our performance management process is designed to help ensure priorities are clear, provide a framework for ongoing feedback and coaching, document accountability, provide a focus on living our values, communicate the expectation of how we work together and identify opportunities for development to improve in an individual's current role and prepare for future roles. 
Health and Safety. Our Company is serious about safety and this is embedded in our global operations. Specific initiatives include, among others, data driven and causality-based accident prevention work, improved process and facility controls, mandatory general education and role specific safety training, joint management-worker health and safety committees, safety audits, incident investigation and improvement measures. 2020 was our safest year on record with a Total Case Incident Rate, the rate of recordable injuries per 200,000 hours worked, of 0.36, significantly below our global target of 0.68.
Our efforts to ensure the safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic included implementing contingency and continuity plans to help position the Company to respond effectively and efficiently to identified risks, safe work practices in accordance with the guidance provided by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and flexible working policies. In addition, we leveraged technology to enable approximately 5,000 employees to transition to remote working in a short time frame and enhanced sanitation and hygiene practices at our office and branch locations.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI). The Company is committed to fostering a safe, collaborative, supporting and respectful environment that values diverse perspectives, mitigates unconscious bias and enables a culture where employees are able to bring their authentic self to work. In the past year we increased our score on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index from 85 in 2019 to 100 in 2020. 
In 2020, we launched an Office of Inclusion made up of employee volunteers with interest and aptitude in advancing DEI, a Global Inclusion Council made up of a cross section of business leaders and DEI stakeholders to direct global strategy and areas of focus, and regional Councils for the USA and Canada to help align focus and guide customized programming to meet local needs. In addition, we had a total of 7 Employee Resource Networks, including the Ability Network (focused on employees with visible and invisible disabilities), the Black African American Leadership Network, the Canada Indigenous Network, the Hispanic or Latinx Network, the LGBT+ Network, the Veterans Network and the Women’s Inclusion Network. The employee participation in these collective networks exceeded 1,300 employees globally.
Regulatory Matters
We operate in a number of jurisdictions and are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and 
regulations in multiple jurisdictions because we blend, manage, handle, store, sell, transport and arrange for the disposal of chemicals, hazardous materials and hazardous waste. These include, without limitation, laws regulating discharges of hazardous substances into the soil, air and water, blending, managing, handling, storing, selling, transporting and disposing of hazardous substances, investigation and remediation of contaminated properties and protecting the safety of our employees and others. Some of these laws and regulations include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), among others. Some of our operations are required to hold environmental permits and licenses to be compliant and certain of our services businesses are also impacted by these laws. 
In addition to environmental laws and regulations, we are subject to various laws and regulations around the world. For example, our business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the United States, as well as similar foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition, and such laws and regulations may impact potential business relationships or transactions with third parties in the future. The Company is also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer, customer, vendor or employee data. Further, an increasing number of laws and regulations focused on hazardous products and substances could also impact our ability to distribute and sell certain products or require significant capital expenditures to meet regulatory requirements. With respect to the laws and regulations noted above, as well as other applicable laws and regulations, the Company's compliance programs may under certain circumstances involve material investments in the form of additional processes, training, personnel, information technology and capital.
Information related to government regulation applicable to our business is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including: (i) Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors; (ii) Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and (iii) “Note 2: Significant accounting policies” and “Note 21: Commitments and contingencies” in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Sustainability
We expect that there will be a continued increase in demand for products, systems and services that meet growing customer sustainability standards, expectations and preferences. We recognize that our ability to continue to provide these products and services requires our business to further advance environmentally and socially responsible means of operating, reflecting the challenges and opportunities presented through increased legal requirements, climate parameters and market developments. We believe that use of the precautionary principle is a key directive of responsible environmental and social governance and is an important factor in the journey toward a more sustainable future.
We demonstrate our commitment through our global sustainability goals, which help us focus on reducing our contribution to global climate change while addressing remediation. In 2018, we became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, reaffirming our ongoing commitments to responsible business, and in 2019 adopted ‘Advancing a Circular Economy’ as a goal to 2021.
We continue to implement the principles set out in our Global Sustainability Policy, working together in the spirit of our guiding principles to minimize environmental impacts and promote resource conservation. To ensure that Univar Solutions maintains its course on the journey toward a more sustainable future, it is crucial that our efforts remain material and allow us to deliver value to all stakeholders. 
We continue to improve Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) initiatives and disclosures throughout our business. In conjunction with support from management, we incorporate ESG initiatives into our business values and priorities of safety, sustainability and value creation. We emphasize constant improvement by continually striving to improve our industry leading safety record, reducing our environmental impact, and increasing transparency. In 2020, we demonstrated our ongoing commitment to ESG practices with 7% of net sales related to food ingredients and products, 6% of net sales related to homecare and industrial cleaning and 4% of net sales related to industrial and municipal water treatment.
Intellectual Property
We consider intellectual property, particularly trade secrets and proprietary technology, as important to our success. We hold some patents and own numerous trademarks in multiple jurisdictions. Further, we have various patent and trademark applications pending in jurisdictions worldwide. Although we consider our patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets to constitute valuable assets, we do not regard any of our businesses as being materially dependent upon an individual patent, trademark, copyright or trade secret.
Significant Customers
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in any of the years presented.
Other
No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any government.
