ITEM 1. Business
General
Bovie Medical Corporation (“Company”, “Bovie Medical”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) was incorporated in 1982, under the laws of the State of Delaware and has its principal executive office at 4 Manhattanville Road, Suite 106, Purchase, NY 10577.
We are an energy-based medical device company specializing in developing, manufacturing and marketing a range of electrosurgical products and technologies, as well as related medical products used in doctor’s offices, surgery centers and hospitals worldwide. Our medical devices are marketed through Bovie’s own well-respected brands (Bovie®, IDS™, ICON™ and DERMTM) and on a private label basis to distributors throughout the world. The Company also leverages its expertise in the design, development and manufacturing of electrosurgical equipment by producing equipment for large, well-known medical device manufacturers through original equipment manufacturing (OEM) agreements, as well as start-up companies with the need for our energy based designs.
We are also the developer of J-Plasma; a patented helium-based plasma surgical product which we believe has the potential to be a transformational product for surgeons. J-Plasma has FDA clearance for the cutting, coagulation and ablation of soft tissue. The J-Plasma system consists of an electrosurgical generator unit (ESU), a handpiece and a supply of helium gas. Radiofrequency (RF) energy is delivered to the handpiece by the ESU and used to energize an electrode. When helium gas is passed over the energized electrode, a helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the patient in the form of a precise helium plasma beam. The energy delivered to the patient via the helium plasma beam is very precise and cooler in temperature in comparison to other surgical energy modalities such as standard RF monopolar energy. J-Plasma has been the subject of ten white papers and has been cited therein for its clinical utility in gynecological and plastic surgery procedures.
Significant Subsidiaries
Aaron Medical Industries, Inc. is a wholly-owned Florida corporation based in Clearwater, Florida. It is principally engaged in the business of marketing our medical products.
Bovie Bulgaria, EOOD is a wholly-owned limited liability company incorporated under Bulgarian law, located in Sofia, Bulgaria. It is engaged in the business of engineering and manufacturing our electrosurgical and OEM products.
Industry
Healthcare reform has caused consolidation among providers, with hospitals merging, physician practices joining hospitals and institutions combining to form Accountable Care Organizations, to manage patients on an interdisciplinary basis. Although the medical device industry can be challenging and very competitive, we believe it will continue to have a positive, long-term growth trajectory with the number of surgical procedures performed increasing annually as a result of the aging “baby boomer” population and other healthcare trends. Additionally, we also anticipate a continued increase in minimally invasive surgical procedures due to ongoing advancements in technology coupled with continued overall pressure to reduce healthcare costs via a reduction in patient trauma and recovery time. Markets will also continue to provide growth opportunities for the medical device industry.
We believe that Bovie Medical has sustainable, competitive advantages in the medical device market for several reasons. We have a long history in electrosurgery. Our inspiration dates back to the first use of an electrosurgical generator in an operating room in the U.S. in 1926 where Dr. William T. Bovie was present. Thus, the Bovie name is recognized by surgeons the world over for having pioneered the electrosurgery field and is recognized for its outstanding product quality supported by strong engineering and research and development capabilities. This history equates to very strong recognition of the Bovie brand. We believe that our equipment and devices have and will continue to provide better experiences for patients at a lower cost to the healthcare system.
Business Strategy
Our objective is to achieve profitable, sustainable growth by increasing our market share in the advanced energy category, including the commercialization of products that have the potential to be transformational with respect to the results they produce for surgeons and patients. In order to achieve this objective, we plan to leverage our long history in the industry, along with the reputation for quality and reliability that the Bovie brand enjoys within the medical community. At the same time, we will expand our product offerings beyond radio frequency devices, move forward with research and developments projects aimed at creating value within our existing product portfolio and build our pipeline of new complementary products and utilize multiple channels to bring new and existing products to market.

BOVIE MEDICAL CORPORATION

We are working to build our position in advanced electrosurgical generators and disposables, which can be used in diversified niche markets with minimally invasive surgical instruments, while furthering our status as a pioneer in plasma technology and its various medical applications.
Our J-Plasma product initially received FDA clearance in 2012 and a CE mark in December, 2014, which enables us to sell the product in Europe. In 2014, we brought together a new management team and created and trained a direct sales force dedicated to J-Plasma. In 2015, we continued the commercialization process for J-Plasma with a multi-faceted strategy designed to accelerate adoption of the product. This strategy primarily involved deployment of a dedicated sales force, extending and customizing the J-Plasma product line and expanding the surgical specialties in which J-Plasma can become the “standard of care“ for certain procedures.
By the end of 2016, we had 17 field-based selling professionals and a network of 18 independent manufacturing representatives, resulting in a total sales force of 35. This is a hospital based selling organization with its focus on the use of J-Plasma for operating room procedures.
Additionally, in 2015, we launched six new J-Plasma hand piece configurations and the Bovie Ultimate generator, which combines J-Plasma functionality with standard electrosurgery modes in one generator. In 2016, we launched our Precise 360 hand piece, which has an angled and rotating tip that enables surgeons to access structures that are difficult to reach using a straight laparoscopic device. The Precise 360 Handpiece was named “Innovation of the Year” by the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons (SLS) at their annual meeting in September 2016. The Bovie Ultimate Generator received a similar recognition in both 2015 and 2014. As a result of our sales, marketing and product development initiatives in 2016, we have significantly increased the number of surgeons using the product, gained approvals for the sale of J-Plasma from Hospital Value Analysis Committees and signed agreements for the use of J-Plasma by the members of Group Purchasing Organizations that serve the medical community.
In order to assist us in leveraging J-Plasma’s precision and effectiveness in multiple surgical specialties, we launched a Medical Advisory Board in 2015 which is currently comprised of surgeons who are recognized leaders in urology, cardiovascular and cardiothoracic surgery. In 2016, we added an additional surgeon to this board from the GYN surgical specialty.
We are continuing to make substantial investments in the development and marketing of our J-Plasma technology for the long term benefit of the Company and its stakeholders and this may adversely affect our short term profitability and cash flow, particularly over the next 12 to 24 months. While we believe that these investments have the potential to generate additional revenues and profits in the future, there can be no assurance that J-Plasma will be successful or that such future revenues and profitability will be realized. From June of 2010 through December 31, 2015, we invested approximately $11.0 million in the development and marketing of our J-Plasma technology and an additional approximately $8.1 million in 2016, bringing the total investment to approximately $19.1 million since inception.
Company Products
We group our products into three main categories: electrosurgery, battery-operated cauteries and other products. Information regarding sales by product categories and related percentages can be found in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. We manufacture and market various medical products, both under private label and the Bovie brands (Bovie, IDS, ICON and DERM), to distributors worldwide. Additionally, Bovie has original equipment manufacturing (OEM) agreements with other medical device manufacturers. These OEM and private label arrangements and our use of the Bovie brands enable us to gain greater market share for the distribution of our products.
Electrosurgery Products
Electrosurgery is our largest product line and includes desiccators, generators, electrodes, electrosurgical pencils and various ancillary disposable products. These electrosurgical products are used during surgical procedures in gynecology, urology, plastic surgery, dermatology, veterinary and other surgical markets for the cutting and coagulation of tissue. It is estimated that electrosurgery is used in 80% of all surgical procedures. Our electrosurgery products fall under two categories, monopolar and bipolar. Monopolar products require the use of a grounding pad attached to the patient for the return of the electrical current, while bipolar products consist of two electrodes; one for the inbound current and one for the return current and therefore do not require the use of a grounding pad.

DERM101 and DERM 102
These effective and economical 10 watt high frequency desiccators provide a low wattage platform for minor in-office skin procedures. We designed these products specifically for family practice physicians, pediatricians and other general practitioners, enabling them to perform simple skin procedures in their offices instead of referring the patient to a specialist saving the patient time and providing additional revenue generating procedures for the physician.
DERM A942™, Bantam|Pro A952™ and Specialist|Pro A1250S
Bovie’s line of electrosurgical generators has been recently updated to provide a more modern look for today’s physician office with added features.
The new Bovie DERM A942 is a low powered 40-watt high frequency desiccator designed primarily for the dermatology and family practice physicians. These units are used mainly for removing skin lesions and growths as well as for coagulation in office-based procedures. The A942 is an upgrade from the previous version A940.
The Bovie Bantam|Pro A952 is a 50-watt high frequency desiccator with the added feature of a cut capacity for outpatient surgical procedures. In effect, the Bovie Bantam|Pro is two independent surgical devices in one small package. The Bantam|Pro replaces the Aaron A950 but with the added feature of Bovie NEM (neutral electrode monitoring), a safety feature that reduces the potential for alternate site burns. This unit is designed mainly for use in doctors’ offices and is used in a broad range of specialties including dermatology, gynecology, family practice, urology, plastic surgery and ophthalmology.
The Bovie Specialist|Pro A1250S is a 120-watt multipurpose electrosurgery generator. The unit features monopolar and bipolar functions with pad sensing. This product is considered to be ideally suited for office-based procedures in the specialties of gynecology, plastic surgery and urology.
Bovie Surgicenter|Pro A2350 - IDS210, Bovie OR|Pro A3350 - IDS310 and IDS400
To address market demand for more powerful electrosurgical generators, Bovie developed 200, 300 and 400-watt multipurpose digital electrosurgery generators designed for the rapidly expanding surgi-center market and the hospital outpatient and inpatient markets. This equipment includes digital hardware that enables very high parallel data processing throughout the operation or procedure. All data is sampled and processed digitally. For the first time in electrosurgery, generators are able to measure tissue impedance in real time (5,000 times a second) thanks to the utilization of digital technology. The design of these units is based on a digital feedback system. By using dedicated digital hardware in place of a general purpose controller for processing data, our equipment enables the power to be adjusted as the impedance varies, to deliver a consistent clinical effect. 
Bovie Surgicenter|Pro A2350 and IDS210 are 200-watt generators that have the capability to be used in the majority of procedures performed today in surgi-center or outpatient settings. Although 200 watts is adequate to do most procedures in the operating room, 300 watts is considered the standard and believed to be what most hospitals and surgi-centers will require. To meet this requirement, we developed Bovie OR|Pro A3350 - IDS310. The Bovie OR|Pro and IDS310 incorporate the best features of the IDS 300 and upgrade its capabilities by providing additional bipolar options, including the 225-watt Bovie bipolar and an auto bipolar feature. The 300 watt units also offer the capability to utilize two pencils with simultaneous activation in fulguration mode. In addition, these newer models meet new standards required to sell these products in many of the global markets. The Bovie IDS 400 is a 400-watt generator designed primarily for sale in markets outside of the United States. These units feature both monopolar and bipolar functions, have pad and tissue sensing and include nine blended cutting setting.
Electrosurgical Disposables
Resistick™ II
Resistick II is a trademarked and proprietary coating that is applied to stainless steel that resist eschar (scab or scar tissue caused by burning) during surgery. We have experienced strong demand for this product since its introduction in 2011 and it represents our continued expansion of the Bovie line of electrosurgical disposables.

BOVIE MEDICAL CORPORATION

Disposable Laparoscopic Electrodes
We have introduced a line of disposable laparoscopic electrodes in Resistick coated and stainless steel for use by physicians from a broad group of specialties including gynecology, general surgery and urology. These electrodes are offered in J-hook, L-hook, needle, ball and spatula design and have an adapter included which makes these laparoscopic electrodes usable with a 3/32“ or 4mm plug.
Cauteries
Battery Operated Cauteries
Battery operated cauteries were originally designed for precise hemostasis (to stop bleeding) in ophthalmology. The current use of cauteries has been substantially expanded to include a broad range of applications. Battery operated cauteries are primarily sterile one-time use products. We have continued to improve our offering and recently had a patent issued covering our snap design cautery. It features a switch mechanism that dramatically reduces the potential for accidental activation. We manufacture one of the broadest lines of cauteries in the world, including but not limited to, a line of replaceable battery and replaceable tip cauteries, which are popular in veterinary and overseas markets.
Other Products
Battery Operated Medical Lights
We manufacture and market a variety of specialty lighting instruments for use in ophthalmology as well as distribute specialty lighting instruments for general surgery, hip replacement surgery and for the placement of endotracheal tubes in emergency and surgical procedures. We also manufacture and market physicians’ office use penlights used in physician offices.
Nerve Locator Stimulator
We manufacture a nerve locator stimulator primarily used for identifying motor nerves in hand and facial reconstructive surgery. This instrument is a sterile, self-contained, battery-operated unit, for one time use.
Growth Products
During 2016, Growth Products consisted of the J-Plasma line of products. Bovie’s J-Plasma technology utilizes a helium ionization process producing a stable thin focused beam of ionized gas that can be controlled in a wide range of temperatures and intensities, providing the surgeon greater control and predictability with minimal thermal damage to surrounding tissue. The development of this helium plasma generator also includes the design of a new proprietary handpiece.
In March 2015, we launched The Bovie Ultimate™ generator. The Bovie Ultimate is a high frequency electrosurgical generator that can be used for delivery of RF energy and/or helium gas plasma to cut, coagulate and ablate soft tissue during open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. The generator offers users monopolar, bipolar and J-Plasma features in a single generator. It has both FDA clearance and CE Mark.
J-Plasma Disposable Portfolio
We offer different hand pieces for open and laparoscopic procedures. The helium-based plasma generated from these devices have been shown to cause less thermal damage to tissue than CO2 laser, argon plasma and RF energy products currently available on the market. The technology has a general indication and can be used for cutting, coagulating and ablating soft tissue. The two primary specialties that are targeted in phase one of the product launch are gynecology and plastic surgery. However, given the wide range of tissue applications for J-Plasma, we are now engaged in ongoing development to create products for urology, cardiovascular and cardiothoracic procedures. The advantages of helium plasma continue to be studied throughout the medical and scientific communities. We believe that surgical applications are just one area of opportunity for this technology.
In March 2016, we expanded our offering of laparoscopic hand pieces by introducing the J-Plasma Precise™ 360 configurations to the market. The four new J-Plasma Precise 360 configurations include two new lengths with either a blade or needle electrode with an angled tip that can be rotated 360 degrees by the user. These new configurations expand the procedure base for J-Plasma by providing surgeons with the tools they need to access additional anatomic locations.

Research and Development and New Products
Our research and development activities are an essential component of our efforts to develop innovative products for introduction in the marketplace to drive sales growth. We continue to emphasize the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines. In 2016, we spent approximately $2.6 million in R&D versus approximately $2.2 million during 2015, an increase of approximately 21.2%. Bovie products introduced to the market in 2016 as a result of our internal research and development opportunities include: J-Plasma Precise 360 hand pieces, the PlazXact™ arthroscopic ablator, the A952 and DERM 942 office based electrosurgical generators, the RF-1254 4MHz electrosurgical generator, and multiple new electrosurgical generators for OEM customers.
Sales & Marketing
The majority of our core products are marketed through medical distributors, which distribute to more than 6,000 hospitals and to doctors and other healthcare facilities. New distributors are contacted through responses to our advertising in international and domestic medical journals and our presence at domestic and international trade shows. International sales represented approximately 12.5% of total revenues in 2016, compared to approximately 16.9% in 2015. The decrease in international sales as a percentage of revenue is due to the discontinuation of certain international relationships and product offerings versus an increase in domestic sales and channel partnerships in Growth Products. Management estimates our products have been sold in more than 150 countries through local dealers coordinated by sales and marketing personnel at our Clearwater, Florida facility.
Competition
We compete with numerous manufacturers and distributors of medical supplies and devices, many of which are large and well-established. With the exception of J-Plasma and endoscopic instrumentation, which are sold directly to the end-user under our own brand, many of our products are private labeled. The majority of the products in our core business are sold through distributors under the Bovie label. The balance is private labeled for major distributors who sell it under their own name. By having private labeled and branded distribution, we are able to increase our position in the marketplace and compete with much larger organizations. While our private label customers distribute products through their internal sales force, the majority of our products are sold through distributors which increase our sales potential and help level the playing field relative to our large competitors that sell direct. Domestically, we continue to believe that we have a substantial market share in the field of electrosurgical generator manufacturing through our Bovie branded and OEM units.
Our main competitors in electrosurgical and accessory markets are Valleylab (a division of Medtronic), Conmed and Erbe Electromedizine. In the battery-operated cautery market, our main competitor is Beaver Visitec and in the endoscopic instrumentation market, it is Ethicon (a division of Johnson and Johnson) and Covidien Surgical Solutions. Currently, we are the only company with helium-based plasma and retractable blade products. However, there are argon plasma competitors and CO2 laser competitors for our target market. We believe our competitive position did not change in 2016.
Intellectual Property
We rely on our intellectual property that we have developed or acquired over the years including patents, trade secrets, technical innovations and various licensing agreements to provide our future growth and build our competitive position. We have been issued 33 patents in the United States and 19 foreign patents. We have 17 pending patent applications in the United States and 9 pending foreign applications. Our intellectual property portfolio for the technology and products related to Growth products is included in these totals and continues to grow. Specific to Growth products, we have been issued 15 U.S. and five foreign patents and we have 14 U.S. and six foreign applications pending. As we continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio we believe it is critical for us to continue to invest in filing patent applications to protect our technology, inventions and improvements. However, we can give no assurance that competitors will not infringe on our patent rights or otherwise create similar or non-infringing competing products that are technically patentable in their own right.

We sell the majority of our current products through major distributors which include Cardinal Health, Independent Medical Co-Op Inc. (IMCO), McKesson Medical Surgical, Inc., Medline, National Distribution and Contracting Inc. (NDC) and Owens & Minor and have manufacturing agreements for private label of certain products with these and others.
During 2016, J-Plasma was named as an Innovative Technology by Vizient, the largest group purchasing organization (GPO) in the United States. In 2015, we signed long-term agreements with three GPO's and believe that partnering with GPO’s is critical to our sales efforts and J-Plasma commercialization efforts.
Backlog
The value of unshipped factory orders is not material.
Employees
At December 31, 2016, we had 217 full-time employees world-wide, of whom 6 were executive officers, 35 supervisory personnel, 17 sales personnel and 159 technical support, administrative and production employees. None of our current employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We consider our employee relations to be good.
