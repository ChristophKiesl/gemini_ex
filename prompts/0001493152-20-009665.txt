Overview
 
We are a renewable fuel and power generation company. Our primary business objective is the production of sustainable, socially responsible alternatives to existing fossil fuel and industrial gas products. Our first commercially viable product is a metal cutting fuel called “MagneGas”. MagneGas is a proprietary synthetic gas comprised primarily of hydrogen that is produced by the Company from its patented Venturi® Flow Submerged Plasma Arc Gasification Units (“Gasification Units”). The Gasification Units are patent protected, and the technology has been licensed to the Company through an exclusive worldwide license. MagneGas is comprised primarily of hydrogen and created through a patented protected process, which we license under an exclusive worldwide license.
Recent Developments
 
On December 5, 2019, Taronis Fuels became an independent, public company when it was spun-off from Taronis Technologies, Inc., its former parent. Taronis Fuels’ common stock trades on the OTCQB under the ticker “TRNF”.
 
During December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant disruptions to its economy, it has now spread significantly and infections have been reported globally on a large scale. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. In particular, the continued spread of the coronavirus globally could adversely impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial results.
 
About “MagneGas”
 
“MagneGas” is the Company’s clean, renewable, environmentally sustainable metal cutting fuel. MagneGas is a synthetic gas comprised primarily of ionized hydrogen gas that is sold as an alternative product substitute for existing fossil fuel-based metal cutting fuels, such as acetylene and propane. MagneGas is made by running a feedstock input through the Gasification Unit. We primarily use medical grade waste ethanol as our chosen input to create MagneGas. Below is a graphic depiction of the process:
 

Venturi® Flow Submerged Plasma Arc Gasification Unit Overview 
-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | ● | Our patented system enables fluid to efficiently pass through a submerged plasma arc. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | To produce a synthetic gas, the feedstock fluid must contain hydrogen and oxygen – carbon supply can be facilitated by the electrodes. 
● | As the fluid passes through the arc, hydrogen, carbon and oxygen molecules are liberated and gasified. 
● | A wide range of feedstocks can produce different gases, with differing flame and heating properties. 
● | Typically, our fuels are 40-60% ionized hydrogen and 30-40% other synthetic hydrocarbon and carbon compounds.

Strategy; Product Distribution
 
The Company utilizes three operational business strategies globally.
 
In the United States, we operate a retail and wholesale model for our industrial gas and welding supply distribution locations branded as “MagneGas Welding Supply”. Our 23 industrial gas retail locations are spread across the southern United States, but are localized in the largest markets for the consumption of industrial gases and welding supplies, including California and Texas. Our MagneGas Welding Supply stores sell and distribute a full line of industrial gases and welding equipment and services to a wide range of end users including metalworking, manufacturing, utility power plants, medical, agriculture, transportation, repair, demolition, salvage and a number of other industries.
 
In addition to the suite of industrial gases and welding supplies we sell through MagneGas Welding Supply, we also market and sell our core proprietary synthetic fuel, MagneGas as a clean, renewable, superior alternative to acetylene - a fossil fuel-based product. We currently have operational Gasification Units in Florida and Texas. Since 2017, we have significantly expanded the range we are able to distribute MagneGas and are now able to more efficiently address markets within a 1,000-mile radius of our production hubs in Florida and Texas. Within the next year, we plan to add one or more Gasification Units in Arizona to serve the western United States.
 
Internationally we operate two additional business models. Our international strategy focuses on the key technological and environmental advantages of MagneGas to disrupt a $7 billion industry outside the United States. We have focused our development initiatives in economies that prioritize water conservation, sustainability and safety. MagneGas has a zero-water consumption footprint, is the only known renewable metal cutting fuel on the planet and has been proven in numerous independent studies to be safer than acetylene. For these reasons, we have initially prioritized expansion into markets that legislate with a view toward environmental conservation and sustainability, specifically water constrained economies in the middle east and the sustainability focused economies of greater Europe.
 
The first model is a sales and joint venture structure for the sale of Gasification Units and the production of MagneGas through joint ventures or direct sales relationships to industrial consumers of metal cutting fuels looking to replace acetylene with MagneGas. Our first major joint venture was entered into in December 2019 with a counterparty in the Republic of Turkey for the initial sale of 30 Gasification Units valued at approximately $165 million. In December 2019, the joint venture ordered 5 Gasification Units which were incremental to the initial 30 Gasification Unit order. No sales revenue was recognized in 2019. The joint venture’s operational objective is a complete ban of acetylene in Turkey, which would justify the purchase of up to 100 Gasification Units from the Company. Under the joint venture model, we will sell Gasification Units that include maintenance contracts and royalty payments back to the Company and will play a key role in advancing safety protocols for end users of our product within the Republic of Turkey.
 
Our second international business model is an owner-operated model where we operate our Gasification Units in strategic locations for the production and sale of MagneGas directly to end-users. In September of 2019, we entered into a lease agreement for our first European location in the Port of Amsterdam with the first lease payment being made in December 2019. We identified the Port of Amsterdam as a key strategic location for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to (a) the European Union has legislated a series of clean technology and renewable energy initiatives to prioritize sustainability, (b) the Company can adopt a high-margin, lean staffing model for marketing MagneGas, (c) the Port of Amsterdam and the surrounding port region is the most industrialized in Europe and (d) the ports within range of our Port of Amsterdam location have in excess of 500 heavy industry prospective consumers for MagneGas. We anticipate launching commercial operations at our location during the third quarter of 2020 and plan to expand our operational footprint in 2021 and beyond.
 
We plan to continue to grow our U.S. retail and wholesale model by expanding the use and adoption of MagneGas and through measured acquisitions of independent industrial gas and welding supply distributors in key markets throughout the U.S. Additionally, we anticipate scaling international expansion of Gasification Unit sales through the establishment of additional joint venture relationships and direct sales to end users. We seek to deliver a renewable and sustainable alternative to propane by 2022 and a sustainable alternative to existing bio-fuel micro grid power generation by 2025.
 
In the year to come we plan to continue to promote MagneGas as a cleaner, safer, smarter alternative to the incumbent fossil fuel-based products globally.

Competitive Business Conditions
 
The competitive landscape in which our business operates is comprised of several major players, such as Linde, Airgas, Matheson, and Air Products, to name a few, and a number of smaller regional and independent distributors which compete for market share in certain geographical areas.
Governmental Approval
 
The transportation of our gas products, including MagneGas, in the United States is regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). The operation of our retail locations is regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). That said, most of our welding supply products and the applications for which they are used are not subject to governmental approval, although we are subject to state and local licensing requirements. Internationally, local and national governments and agencies govern the sale and transportation of our products.
Governmental Regulations
 
In the United States, we are regulated by the DOT and state transportation agencies in the method of storage and transportation of the gases we make and sell. Internationally, various similar national and local regulatory bodies govern the production, transportation and sale of our Gasification Units and MagneGas in each country where we intend to operate or sell our products or technology. We believe that our current operations are fully compliant with applicable the local, state and federal regulations where we operate.
Key Factors Affecting Performance
 
Sales of Gasification Units, Gases and Welding Supplies
 
We generate substantially all of our revenue through the sale of Gasification Units, industrial gases and welding equipment for a wide range of end market users. In some cases, we generate revenue from the sale of services.
Utilization of Our Products
 
We believe there is significant opportunity to increase awareness for and the use of MagneGas as an alternative to acetylene and propane. Our product is environmentally friendly, renewable and burns clean. It has been independently demonstrated to be a safer alternative to acetylene. Our product is also priced significantly less than acetylene. We believe that as more of our present and future customers realize the potential benefits of MagneGas, our market share will expand, our sales will continue to grow and diversify.
 
Investment in Infrastructure and Growth
 
Our ability to increase our sales of industrial gases and welding equipment and the ancillary services we offer and to further penetrate our target markets is dependent in large part on our ability to invest in our infrastructure and in our sales and marketing efforts. We continue to invest in value-added infrastructure, such as gasification units, gas fill plants and gas cylinders to serve our end clients. In order to drive future growth, we plan to hire additional sales and customer support personnel and to invest in marketing our products to our target customers both in the United States and internationally. We believe this will lead to corresponding increases in our operating expenses, and thus may negatively impact our operating results in the short term, although we believe that these investments will grow and improve our business and financial condition over the long term.
 
Increased System Efficiency for Greater Fuel Output
 
We continue to conduct ongoing research and development to discover new methods to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of the production of our fuels. Since 2012, we have reduced our proprietary production costs by 88% and are working diligently to reduce costs by another 25% in the next year, which we believe will further enable our pricing competitiveness relative to acetylene. During the last two fiscal years, we typically have periodically expanded our research and development team in order to support these technology driven enhancements to our propriety manufacturing processes. We will receive the benefit of continued research and development results and initiatives pursuant to our exclusive intellectual property license with Taronis Technologies, Inc.
