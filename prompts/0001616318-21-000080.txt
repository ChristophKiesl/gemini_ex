Market Opportunity 
We participate in the global market for consumer goods geared toward outdoor recreation and shooting sports. Spending on outdoor recreation products in the U.S., including the purchase of gear for bicycling, camping, fishing, hunting, motorcycling, off-roading, snow sports, trail sports, and wildlife viewing, contributed to the economies of all 50 states and accounted for $460 billion of current-dollar gross domestic product and $788 billion in gross output (consumer spending) in 2019, a $10 billion consumer spending increase from 2017, according to The Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics report released in November, 2020.

The firearms and ammunition industry has grown and created over 176,000 new, well-paying jobs since the economic downturn of 2008. And more recently, in 2020, the firearm and ammunition industry was responsible for as much as $63 billion in total economic activity.
Other markets have grown during the outdoor resurgence of 2020. Sales of bicycles were up 65% in 2020 from 2019 and electric bike sales rose 145% for the same period, despite shortages across many bike shops. Golf equipment sales were up 10%, as rounds played were up 14% from 2019 to 2020. These increases are in line with increased participation in camping, where more families and first time campers were getting outdoors. In 2020, 82% of first-time campers brought their families along for the journey.

Leading Innovation and Product Development Competencies 
We believe our product development capabilities and intellectual property portfolio provide us with a strong competitive advantage. By applying our engineering and manufacturing expertise, we have been able to bring to market new and innovative products that maintain product differentiation while targeting affordability for our end consumers. 
We have continuously invested in research and development and made disciplined investments in new technology to deliver sustainable growth and satisfy the evolving needs of our customers. Our current intellectual property portfolio includes approximately 1,240 U.S. and foreign patents, as well as valuable proprietary trade secrets and technological know-how that we share across our platform. We employ approximately 115 dedicated design and product development professionals across the organization. Recent examples of our innovative, market-leading products include:
•Bushnell, an industry leader in performance optics, introduced a new reflex sight – the RXS-100. Designed with user-adjustable brightness settings and multi-platform versatility, the new RXS-100 offers outstanding value at an unheard-of price point. At the core of the RXS-100 is a crisp 4-MOA dot with eight brightness settings and battery life that provides over 5,000 hours of runtime on the mid setting.
•For motocross enthusiasts, Bell recently introduced the Moto-10 Spherical, the evolution of the Bell Moto series. As a direct result of our athletes' influence and feedback, the Moto-10 achieves a winning combination of increased protection, weight reduction, and extreme airflow.

Proven Manufacturing, Global Sourcing, and Distribution Platform 
We believe that our state-of-the-art manufacturing expertise, sourcing and distribution capabilities, and high-quality retail, wholesale and distributor networks allow us to produce, deliver and replenish products in a more efficient and faster manner than our competitors. We believe this speed allows us to better serve the needs of our customers and end consumers and capture market share. We also believe the scale and scope of our manufacturing and distribution operations also allows us to be one of the lowest-cost producers in many of our product categories. 
Integrated supply chain management is a core focus of our company. We procure large quantities of raw materials for our manufacturing operations and we leverage negotiating disciplines and production methods, with the objective of obtaining the best price and delivery available as well as low-cost conversion of raw materials into finished product. We also source finished product both domestically and internationally for global distribution. We continuously seek to improve our vendor base as well as our in-country support and oversight, and, through our integrated supply chain management process, we seek to provide year-over-year reductions in product costs. We believe the scope and scale of our sourcing network would be difficult to replicate. 
Our supply chain and logistics infrastructure gives us the ability to serve a broad array of wholesale and retail customers, many of whom rely on us for services such as category management, marketing campaigns, merchandising and inventory replenishment. We believe our strong wholesale and retail relationships and diverse product offering provide us with a unique competitive advantage.
We maintain positive relationships with our retail partners based on trust and professionalism. Our long-standing commitment to our customers, diverse product offering and focus on profitability for both our company and our retail partners have enabled us to gain shelf space and secure premium placement of our products at many major retailers. Our top retail and distributor partners include Academy, Amazon, Bass Pro Shops/Cabela's, Big Rock Sports, Sports South, Sportsman's Warehouse, Target, and Walmart. Our management team interfaces directly with the executives of many of our top retail partners to ensure we are delivering the products our retailers need to meet the demands of the end consumer in the most efficient and profitable manner possible. Furthermore, we believe our scale allows us to leverage our platform to efficiently and profitably service our largest retail customers. For example, we work with our key retail customers to develop marketing and advertising campaigns, provide inventory replenishment support, and organize product category merchandising plans. 
Our Strategy
The first phase of our strategic transformation plan focused on stabilizing our business and building a strong foundation for the future by improving profitability, enhancing operational efficiency, and reducing financial leverage though enhanced cash-flow generation and the divestiture of non-core businesses. We have made significant progress toward these goals by making key leadership changes, investing in digital and e-commerce platforms, addressing our cost structure and strengthening the balance sheet. Learnings from the last few years have been incorporated into our forward-looking plans to continue to improve both financial and operational performance and accelerate value creation. 
In fiscal year 2021, we built upon the capabilities developed during the first two years of our transformation, with an additional emphasis on driving long-term, profitable organic sales growth. Vista Outdoor has plans in place under each of its five strategic pillars to deliver long-term, sustainable, profitable growth and continued cash generation, solidifying our position as the outdoor sports and recreation market leader.
We remain relentlessly focused on the following five strategic pillars, which define our key priorities and investment focus areas:
•Talent and Culture: Invest in talent and foster our culture of agility, efficiency, and innovation.
•Organic Growth: Identify and capture opportunities for organic growth and market share expansion by:
Table of Contents

◦allocating capital to our brands to aid in their development of new and innovative products that serve the needs and preferences of their core consumers; and 
◦leveraging and expanding our distribution channels to expand the commercial presence of all of our brands and efficiently deliver product to meet consumer demand and shopping behavior.
•Centers of Excellence: Leverage our shared resources, expertise and scale to achieve a level of excellence that would be out of reach for our individual brands, with a focus on:
◦operational excellence to improve margins, supply chain resiliency, and agility; 
◦e-commerce, direct-to-consumer and digital marketing capabilities;
◦acquisition target selection, deal execution and integration.
•Acquisitions: Acquire complementary businesses that we can take to the next level in terms of sales and profitability.
•Capital Allocation: Maintain a conservative balance sheet, healthy margins and strong cash flow generation to provide financial flexibility and enable us to thrive and grow at all points in the market demand cycle.
Customers and Marketing 
Our primary customers are retailers and distributors who serve outdoor enthusiasts, hunters, recreational shooters, and athletes, as well as law enforcement and military professionals. Sales to our top ten customers consumer sales accounted for approximately 40% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal year 2021. In fiscal year 2021, U.S. customers represented approximately 86% of our sales and customers outside of the U.S. represented approximately 14% of our sales. Of our fiscal year 2021 sales, approximately 11% was to law enforcement and military professionals. See Note 18, Operating Segment Information, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information regarding our customers and geographic information regarding our sales. 
We believe the outdoor recreation and shooting sports industries are led by enthusiasts with a passion for reliable, high-performance products, who rely on a wide variety of media for opinions and recommendations about available products. We use paid, earned, shared, and owned media to enhance the perception of our brands and products and to reinforce our leadership positions in the market. We supplement this exposure with data-driven print and digital advertising that is designed to maximize reach and return on investment. We have an industry-leading digital media presence that includes YouTube and other social media influencers. Our goal is to strengthen our existing consumers' brand loyalty while at the same time reaching new users of our products. 
E-commerce distribution channels, including our brands’ direct-to-consumer websites, represent an increasing portion of our sales across all of our brands. Through our shared E-commerce Center of Excellence, we deploy resources and expertise to all of our brands to help them accelerate the growth of their presence in these channels and respond to changes in consumer shopping behavior.
Quality Assurance 
We maintain a disciplined quality assurance process. We set stringent metrics to drive year-over-year quality improvements. We also have customer call centers, which allow us to collect important customer data and feedback on our customer service to ensure that our customers and end consumers are satisfied with our products and customer service. 
Human Capital
People are at the center of our success. We employ over 5,900 people spread across multiple states, Puerto Rico, and numerous countries. Our employees lead in the fields of manufacturing, distribution, supply chain management, finance and marketing, among many other talents and specialties. In total, 70% of our employees are in production roles, directly building or distributing world-class outdoor recreation gear and products for our consumers. We have no union-represented employees. We believe that our employee relations generally are good. 
Support for our people drives us at every level. We prioritize employee success and well-being through a strong corporate infrastructure that supports employee engagement, recruiting, professional development, safety, diversity, compensation, and benefits. Our overall commitment and value proposition for our employees begins with our culture, which is rooted in the belief that the success of our business enables us to do good for our communities, employees, and charitable partners. 
Our Purpose and Vision 
Our purpose is to be known as a passionate outdoor company with the brands, products and culture that unite people around a shared love and responsibility for the outdoors. 
Table of Contents

Our vision is to build powerhouse brands that empower people to achieve their goals and live their best outdoor lives. We are committed to investing in our people, creating safe environments, leading through innovation and promoting stewardship and participation in all that we do.
Employee Engagement 
We are committed to two-way conversations with employees. The Chief Executive Officer and business unit general managers hold regular employee town hall meetings where they provide updates and take employee questions. We regularly update employees with company news, important notices, our philanthropic efforts, and employee stories through many channels, including our internal digital hub (InSite), social media, and our public-facing website. These employee engagement initiatives were especially important during the lockdowns of COVID-19 when personal interactions were limited and so much uncertainty existed. To that end, we were pleased to be recognized for the first time by Forbes as one of America’s Best Midsize Employers in February 2021, which demonstrated that our efforts to engage and support employees during the pandemic were well received. 
Recruiting
We place a large emphasis on recruiting talented people to join our company. We prioritize the hiring of smart, energetic and passionate people who not only have the skills we need to thrive in the marketplace, but who also have diverse experiences and perspectives. We have partnered with a variety of organizations to expand our recruiting base so that we can better attract talented veterans, people of color, women and others with backgrounds who would strengthen our business and underlying culture. 
Professional Development 
We take career development seriously. We go to great lengths to make learning and knowledge available to our employees. We deploy a variety of worker training programs on our factory and production floors, including the use of internal leaders and outside safety trainers. Programs such as tuition reimbursement, internships and employee scholarship programs are some of the ways we are investing in our people and their knowledge. We know that these investments are not only good for people, but they are also good for our business. We have seen an increase in internal promotions from all levels of the organization. 
Safety 
We operate in a highly-regulated environment in the U.S. and international markets. U.S. federal, state, and local governmental entities, and foreign governments regulate many aspects of our business through product safety standards, laws and regulations, including California’s Safe Water and Toxic Enforcement Act, Europe’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), Europe’s Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) and the US Toxics in Packaging Clearinghouse (TPCH).
While employees across our locations work to ensure compliance with the product safety laws and regulations that apply to their products, we have a team of dedicated professionals within the corporate Compliance Department who oversee all aspects of product safety and compliance across the company. Our product safety and compliance personnel have broad and diverse academic and experience credentials and are often sought out by regulators, law enforcement, other industry participants and internal stakeholders to serve as expert consultants and witnesses. This organizational structure, together with robust internal policies and procedures, help ensure that we meet our continuing obligations to regulators and consumers throughout the product life cycles and to keep our employees safe.
On the consumer side, as an outdoor sports and recreation company, we believe that our consumers should be safe when engaging in the outdoor activity of their choice. We partner with a variety of organizations who share these same goals, support policies that advance safety initiatives and use our brand platforms to educate and share best practices for the safe use of our products. 
Finally, the global pandemic presented many challenges to employees and we went to great lengths to promote safety and wellness. For many in the organization, working-from-home was applied long before policymakers made it a requirement. For employees whose essential functions were performed on-site and in-person, we implemented a variety of protocols to ensure their safety, from social distancing and leave flexibility to altered entry/exit pathways and adoption of other regulations or best practices. 
The pandemic also brought out the best in our people. Our teams donated surplus personal protection equipment, repurposed thousands of ski goggles, and donated water bottles to medical professionals. We further supported our partners in the nonprofit sector, whose missions of getting kids, veterans, and the disadvantaged outside played a major role in keeping people healthy during the pandemic.

Diversity and Inclusion 
We published our first annual Environmental, Social and Governance Impact Report in June 2020. As part of this vision, we committed to becoming a more diverse and inclusive company. Strong and diverse communities are crucial to our success, both in business and in fulfilling our mission to bring more people outside. 
We continuously look for ways to be a more diverse and inclusive company, from improving our recruiting and marketing efforts to expanding career growth opportunities and external partnerships. In 2020, we began disclosing diversity and inclusion metrics to provide both benchmarks for where we currently stand, and goals for us to strive to meet in the future. 
Currently, 19% of our domestic employee base is comprised of persons of color, up from 13% last year. At the senior management level, the figure is approximately 17% for both years.
Currently, 29% of our domestic employees are women, compared to 26% last year. At the senior management level, the figure is approximately 8% for both years. At the Board of Directors level, the figure is 22% for both years. We have also seen growth in our levels just below the senior management level during the year.
Currently, approximately 8% our workforce are veterans, which is on par with the national average and the same as last year. 
Compensation
We believe in equal pay for equal work. We believe pay and compensation should match the talent, experience and skill set of a person, and nothing else. We regularly review our compensation practices and benchmark our performance to others in the industry to ensure we are fulfilling our obligations of fair pay. 
Benefits
Our benefit programs offer comprehensive coverage to help protect our employees’ health, family, and future, and are an important part of the total compensation we provide. We offer both company-provided and optional benefits, including Basic Life Insurance, Medical, Prescription and Telemedicine, and an Employee Product Purchase Program. We offer a 401(k) savings plan, with a higher-than-average match for participating employees. 
We expanded our offerings as COVID-19 changed the landscape in 2020. We partnered with Care.com to give our employees access and discounts to childcare and other support as they balanced their households during lockdowns and closures. We’ve also expanded our Employee Assistance Program to include additional mental health offerings and access to services to support our employees during the trials and changes brought about through COVID-19. 
Competition 
Competition in the markets in which we operate is based on a number of factors, including price, quality, product innovation, performance, reliability, styling, product features, and warranties, as well as sales and marketing programs. Given the diversity of our product portfolio, we have various significant competitors in each of our markets, including: Nikon and Vortex in the optics market; Hydro Flask, Contigo, Yeti, Osprey, and Nalgene in the hydration systems market; Traeger, Pit Boss, Blackstone, and Lodge in the outdoor cooking market; Schwinn, Bontrager, Smith, Specialized, and Shoei in the bike and snow helmet and accessories markets; Garmin and Nikon in the golf electronics market; Winchester Ammunition of Olin Corporation, and various smaller manufacturers and importers, including Black Hills Ammunition, CBC Group, Fiocchi Ammunition, Hornady, PMC, Rio Ammunition, and Wolf in the ammunition market.
Seasonality
Our business experiences a certain level of seasonality. Sales of our spring and summer products, such as golf accessories, can be adversely impacted by unseasonably cold or wet weather in those periods. Our winter sport accessories sales can be negatively impacted by unseasonably warm or dry weather. Sales of our premium hunting accessories are generally highest during the months of August through December due to shipments around the fall hunting season and holidays.
Intellectual Property 
In the highly competitive business in which we operate, our tradenames, service marks, and trademarks are important to distinguish our products and services from our competitors. We rely on trade secrets, continuing technological innovations, and licensing arrangements to maintain and improve our competitive position. We also have a portfolio of approximately 1,240 U.S. and foreign patents, and we believe these patents, as well as unpatented research, development, and engineering skills make important contributions to our business. We are not aware of any facts which would negatively impact our continuing use of any of our tradenames, service marks, trademarks, or patents.

Regulatory Matters 
Like many other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products, we are required to comply with numerous laws, rules, and regulations, including those involving labor and employment law, environmental law, consumer product safety, data privacy and security, workplace safety, and the export and import of our products. These laws, rules, and regulations currently impose significant compliance requirements on our business, and more restrictive laws, rules, and regulations may be adopted in the future. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable domestic and international laws and regulations. 
Our operations are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing the discharge, treatment, storage, transportation, remediation, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and restoration of damages to the environment, as well as health and safety matters. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and that forward-looking, proper and cost-effective management of air, land, and water resources is vital to the long-term success of our business. Our environmental policy identifies key objectives for implementing this commitment throughout our operations. We incur operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental requirements and could incur significant additional costs as a result of more stringent requirements that may be promulgated in the future. 
Some environmental laws, such as the U.S. federal Superfund law and similar state laws, can impose liability, without regard to fault, for the entire cost of the cleanup of contaminated sites on current or former site owners and operators or parties who sent wastes to such sites. We are conducting investigation and/or remediation activities at certain of our current or former sites where impacts from our historical operations have been identified. Certain of our former subsidiaries have been identified as potentially responsible parties (“PRP”), along with other parties, in regulatory agency actions associated with hazardous waste sites. While uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of the ultimate environmental liabilities at these sites, based on currently available information, we do not currently expect that these potential liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. We could, however, incur substantial additional costs as a result of any additional obligations imposed or conditions identified at these or other sites in the future. 
As a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products, we are subject to various domestic and international consumer product safety laws, such as the Consumer Products Safety Act, which empowers the Consumer Products Safety Commission to investigate and deem certain of our products as unsafe or hazardous. Under certain circumstances, the Consumer Products Safety Commission or similar international agencies could ask a court to require us to repurchase or recall one or more of our products. In addition, laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some cities and states, as well as in other countries in which we sell our products. 
We are also subject to the rules and regulations of the ATF and various state and international agencies that control the manufacture, export, import, distribution, and sale of firearms, explosives, and ammunition. If we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, these agencies may limit our growth or business activities, or, in extreme cases, revoke our licenses to do business. Our business, as well as the business of all producers and marketers of ammunition, is also subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations and protocols. Applicable laws:
•require the licensing of all persons manufacturing, exporting, importing, or selling ammunition as a business; 
•require labeling and tracking the acquisition and disposition of certain types of ammunition, and certain related products; 
•regulate the use and storage of gun powder or other energetic materials; 
•regulate the interstate sale of certain ammunition; 
•limit the mail-order sale of ammunition; 
•regulate our employment of personnel with certain criminal convictions; and 
•restrict access to ammunition manufacturing facilities for certain individuals from other countries or with criminal convictions.
In some cases, the handling of our technical data and the international sale of our products is also regulated by the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce. These agencies oversee the export of certain of our products including ammunition and night vision devices and related technical data, amongst other products. In many instances, we must obtain export authorizations for international shipments. To date, most of our requests for export licenses have been approved. These agencies can impose civil and criminal penalties, including preventing us from exporting our products, for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
Table of Contents

We are also regulated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which regulates the out-bound and in-bound movement of certain of our products, as well as components, parts, and materials used in our manufacturing processes. The agency is authorized to detain and seize shipments, as well as penalize us for failure to comply with applicable regulations. The agency also works closely with the Department of State and the Department of Commerce to protect national security.
