Item 1. Business. 
Introduction 
 We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Initial Business Combination”). Our Sponsor is an affiliate of Victory Park Capital Advisors, LLC (“VPC”), a registered investment advisor with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) founded in 2007. VPC’s institutional investor base is diversified geographically and includes sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, financial institutions, foundations, endowments and family offices for which it has invested approximately $6.0 billion in over 120 transactions across North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Southeast Asia and Oceania. 
 On March 9, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 25,578,466 units (the “Units”), including the issuance of 3,078,466 Units as a result of the underwriter’s partial exercise of its over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Ordinary Shares” or “Public Shares”) and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (the “Public Warrants”). The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $255,784,660. 
 Simultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, we completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 5,127,129 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants” and together with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”) to VPC Impact Acquisition Holding Sponsor II, LLC (the “Sponsor”) at a purchase price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $7,690,693. 
 Prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, on January 14, 2021, we issued an aggregate of 7,187,500 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 (the “Founder Shares”), to the Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 in cash. On January 15, 2021, the Sponsor forfeited 718,750 Founder Shares back to the Company for no consideration, resulting in an aggregate of 6,468,750 Founder Shares outstanding. Subsequently, the Sponsor transferred 60,000 Founder Shares in the aggregate to each independent director, Kai Schmitz, Adrienne Harris and Senator Joseph Lieberman, resulting in the Sponsor holding 6,408,750 Founder Shares. Ms. Harris resigned from the board of directors effective as of September 7, 2021. Up to 843,750 Founder Shares were subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option was exercised. In connection with the underwriters’ partial exercise of their over-allotment option on March 9, 2021, the Sponsor forfeited 74,133 Founder Shares and the remaining 769,617 Founder Shares ceased to be subject to forfeiture, resulting in the Sponsor holding 6,394,617 Founder Shares. 
 A total of $255,784,784, comprised of $250,668,966.80 of the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering (which amount includes $8,952,463 of the underwriters’ deferred discount) and $5,115,693.20 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the “Trust Account”) at Bank of America, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. 
 The funds held in the Trust Account are invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a 
 
4 

  maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of an Initial Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account. 
 As of December 31, 2021, there was $255,806,358 in cash and securities held in the Trust Account, which includes interest income available to us of $21,698. $449,338 of cash is held outside the Trust Account, available for working capital needs. The Company is a Cayman Islands exempted company and is presently not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements in the Cayman Islands or the United States. 
 Termination of Proposed Business Combination 
 On August 2, 2021, we entered into a business combination agreement (together with the first amendment dated September 29, 2021, the “Business Combination Agreement”) with FinAccel Pte. Ltd. (“FinAccel”) and certain other affiliated entities, pursuant to which, among other things, FinAccel would merge with and into our holding company. The Business Combination Agreement was unanimously approved by our board of directors on July 29, 2021. 
 On March 11, 2022, we entered into a termination and fee agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) with FinAccel, Akshay Garg and certain other affiliated entities. Pursuant to the terms of the Termination Agreement, the parties agreed to mutually terminate the Business Combination Agreement, effective on March 11, 2022, subject to the conditions set forth in the Termination Agreement. In conjunction with the termination of the Business Combination Agreement, the Subscription Agreements, the Investor Rights Agreement, the Founder Holder Agreement and the other Ancillary Documents (as each is defined in the Business Combination Agreement) automatically terminated in accordance with their respective terms as of the same date. 
 The Termination Agreement provides that we will be entitled to receive (i) an aggregate sum not to exceed $4,000,000 in reimbursement for certain documented out-of-pocket third party expenses incurred by VIH (the “Termination Reimbursement Amount”), which is payable by FinAccel within six months of the date of the Termination Agreement and (ii) if we have not consummated an initial business combination and have determined to redeem our public shares and liquidate or dissolve thereafter (and we do not withdraw such determination, to the extent that such determination can be withdrawn), FinAccel will issue and deliver to VIH a penny warrant, on terms mutually agreeable to FinAccel and us, to purchase a number of FinAccel’s ordinary shares equal to three and one-half percent (3.5%) of the Fully Diluted Share Number (as defined in the Termination Agreement) of FinAccel as of the date of the Termination Agreement, subject to customary anti-dilution protections (the “Equity Termination Fee”). If FinAccel engages in any transaction that would be deemed a Sale of the Company (as defined in the Termination Agreement), then the party surviving the sale transaction will assume the foregoing obligation, to satisfy the Equity Termination Fee. If FinAccel fails to pay the Termination Reimbursement Amount, then a default interest of five percent (5%) per annum will accrue on a daily basis from the date the Termination Reimbursement Amount was due and payable until all such unpaid amounts have been paid. 
 The Termination Agreement contains mutual releases by all parties thereto, for all claims known and unknown, relating and arising out of, or relating to, among other things, the Business Combination Agreement, the ancillary documents to the Business Combination Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, subject to certain exceptions with respect to claims that cannot be waived by law, the parties obligations under the Termination Agreement and commercial transactions unrelated to the Business Combination Agreement. 
 Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 General 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our Initial Business Combination using cash held in the Trust Account, shares issued to the 
 
5 

  owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 If our Initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our Class A Ordinary Shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination 
 While we may pursue an Initial Business Combination target in any industry, we intend to focus our search on Initial Business Combination opportunities on global and regional Fintech businesses. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (as amended on March 4, 2021, our “Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association”) prohibits us from entering into an Initial Business Combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
 Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more Initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it likely that our board of directors will be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any Initial Business Combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. 
 We anticipate structuring our Initial Business Combination so that the post transaction company in which we own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our Initial Business Combination such that the post transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Initial Business Combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the Initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Initial Business Combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our Initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our Initial Business Combination.

  If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above. If the Initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, clinical, scientific, IP, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the Initial Business Combination transaction. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our Initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Initial Business Combination. Except as described herein, the Company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our Initial Business Combination. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an Initial Business Combination with a target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or from completing the Initial Business Combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an Initial Business Combination with a target that is affiliated (as defined in our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association) with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions stating that the consideration to be paid by us in such an Initial Business Combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide the holders of our Public Shares (our “Public Shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. The amount in the Trust Account at such time is anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per Public Share. The per share amount we will distribute to Public Shareholders who properly redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and any Public Shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination. 
 Submission of our Initial Business Combination to a Shareholder Vote 
 In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our Public Shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the Initial Business Combination.

  If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our Initial Business Combination only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. A quorum for such meeting will be present if the holders of one-third of issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting are represented in person or by proxy. Our Sponsor, officers and directors will count toward this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our Initial Business Combination. For purposes of seeking approval of an ordinary resolution, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our Initial Business Combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares, we would need 9,591,925, or 37.5%, of the 25,578,466 public shares sold in the Initial Public Offering to be voted in favor of an Initial Business Combination in order to have our Initial Business Combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted). These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreement of our sponsor, officers and directors, may make it more likely that we will consummate our Initial Business Combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a public shareholder on the record date for the general meeting held to approve the proposed transaction. 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our Initial Business Combination. There is no limit on the number of Public Shares our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). 
 We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. 
 The purpose of any such purchases of Public Shares could be to vote such Public Shares in favor of the Initial Business Combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the Initial Business Combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our Initial Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of Public Warrants could be to reduce the number of Public Warrants outstanding or to vote such Public Warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our Initial Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A Ordinary Shares or Public Warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.

  Conduct of Redemptions Pursuant to Tender Offer Rules 
 If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our Initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on Public Shareholders not tendering more than the number of Public Shares we are permitted to redeem. If Public Shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the Initial Business Combination. 
 Upon the public announcement of our Initial Business Combination, if we elect to conduct redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our Class A Ordinary Shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Shareholder Approval 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that a Public Shareholders, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent (the “Excess Shares”). We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed Initial Business Combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a Public Shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s Public Shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the Public Shares without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with an Initial Business Combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our Initial Business Combination. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination 
 Our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that we will have only until March 9, 2023 to complete our Initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Initial Business Combination within such period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses; (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination by March 9, 2023.

  Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our Initial Business Combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess similar or greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash to our Public Shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our Initial Business Combination and our issued and outstanding Warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an Initial Business Combination. 
Employees 
 We currently have three officers: Brendan Carroll, Gordon Watson and Carly Altieri. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the stage of the combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our Initial Business Combination.
