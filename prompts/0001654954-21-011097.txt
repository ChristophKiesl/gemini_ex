  Item 1. Business.
  
 General. Incorporated in 1954, Scientific Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (which along with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) is engaged in the design, manufacture, and marketing of standard benchtop laboratory equipment (“Benchtop Laboratory Equipment”), and through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Scientific Bioprocessing Holdings, Inc. (“SBHI”), the licensing, design, manufacture, and marketing of bioprocessing systems and products (“Bioprocessing Systems”). SBHI has two wholly-owned subsidiaries – Scientific Bioprocessing, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“SBI”) and aquila biolabs GmbH (“Aquila”), a German corporation. The Company’s products are used primarily for research purposes by universities, pharmaceutical companies, pharmacies, national laboratories, medical device manufacturers, and other industries performing laboratory-scale research. Until November 30, 2020, the Company was also engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of customized catalyst research instruments through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Altamira Instruments, Inc, a Delaware corporation (“Altamira”). On November 30, 2020, the Company sold significantly all of Altamira’s assets and Altamira’s operations were discontinued.
  
 Operating Segments. The Company views its operations as two segments: the manufacture and marketing of standard Benchtop Laboratory Equipment which includes various types of equipment used for research and sample preparation in university, pharmacy and industrial laboratories sold primarily through laboratory equipment distributors and online; and the development, manufacture, and sublicensing of bioprocessing products. For certain financial information regarding the Company’s operating segments, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8.
  
 Products.
  
 Benchtop Laboratory Equipment. The Company’s Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products consist of mixers and shakers, rotators/rockers, refrigerated and shaking incubators, and magnetic stirrers sold under the “Genie ™” brand, and pharmacy and laboratory balances and scales, force gauges, and moisture analyzers under the “Torbal®” brand. Sales of the Company’s principal product, the Vortex-Genie® 2 Mixer, excluding accessories, represented approximately 47% and 39% of the Company’s total net revenues for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 (“fiscal 2021”) and June 30, 2020 (“fiscal 2020”) respectively,and 51% and 45% of the segment’s sales for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively.
  
 The Company’s vortex mixer is used to mix the contents of test tubes, beakers, and other various containers by placing such containers on a rotating cup or other attachments which cause the contents to be mixed at varying speeds.

 Bioprocessing Systems. The Company, through SBHI, sublicenses certain patents and technology it holds relating to bioprocessing products exclusively under a license with the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (“UMBC”), for which it receives royalties for patents expiring in August 2021 and December 2023. SBHI through its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, SBI and Aquila, is also engaged in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of bioprocessing products, principally products incorporating smart sensors and state of the art software analytics. Products offered for sale include the Cell Growth Quantifier (“CGQ”) for Biomass monitoring in shake flasks, the Liquid Injection System (“LIS”) for automated feeding in shake flasks, and a line of coaster systems and flow-through cells for pH and DO monitoring.
  
 Product Development. The Company designs and develops substantially all of its products. Company personnel formulate plans and concepts for new products and improvements or modifications of existing products. The Company engages outside consultants to augment its internal engineering capabilities in areas such as industrial and electronics design.
  
 Major Customers. Sales to three customers, principally of the Vortex-Genie 2 Mixer, represented 21% and 11% of total net revenues for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively, and 23% and 13% of Benchtop Laboratory Equipment product sales, for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively.
  
 Marketing.
  
 Benchtop Laboratory Equipment. The Company’s Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products sold under the “Genie” brand are generally distributed and marketed through an established network of domestic and overseas laboratory equipment distributors who sell the Company’s products through websites, printed catalogs and sales force.
  
 The Company’s “Torbal” brand products are primarily marketed and sold online, and primarily on a direct basis, with only a few distributors. The Company’s VIVID automated pill counter is sold through two exclusive distributors in North America. The Company markets its products through trade publication advertising, brochures and catalogs, the Company’s website, one sales manager in the U.S., a consultant in Europe and, when practicable, attendance at industry trade shows.
  
 In general, due to the reliance on sales through distribution, it takes two to three years for a new Genie brand Benchtop Laboratory Equipment product to begin generating meaningful sales.
  
 Bioprocessing Systems. The Company’s Bioprocessing Systems products are marketed under a newly created marketing category “Digitally Simplified Bioprocessing” through a direct sales force consisting of ten sales professionals and application scientists plus one distributor.  Sales are supported via marketing through websites, content creation, application notes, mailings, trade shows, online marketing campaigns, and membership in various public/private research partnerships.
  
 Assembly and Production. The Company has facilities in Bohemia, New York and Orangeburg, New York where is conducts its Benchtop Laboratory Equipment operations. The Company also has an operating facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where it conducts sales, marketing, shipping, and administrative functions; and, beginning on April 29, 2021, as a result of the Company’s acquisition of Aquila, the Company operates a facility in Baesweiller, Germany where it conducts product development, manufacturing, sales, marketing and administration. The Company’s production operations principally involve assembly of components supplied by various domestic and international independent suppliers.
