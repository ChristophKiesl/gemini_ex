Florida Pneumatic
Florida Pneumatic directly, and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries ETI, UAT, and Jiffy, imports, manufactures, and markets pneumatic hand tools of its own design, primarily to the retail, industrial, automotive and aerospace markets. Its products include sanders, grinders, drills, saws, and impact wrenches. These tools are similar in appearance and function to electric hand tools, but are powered by compressed air, rather than by electricity or a battery. Air tools, as they are more commonly referred to, generally offer better performance, and weigh less than their electrical counterparts. Florida Pneumatic imports and/or manufactures approximately 75 types of pneumatic hand tools, most of which are sold at prices ranging from $50 to $1,000, under the names “Florida Pneumatic,” “Universal Tool”, “Jiffy Air Tool”, AIRCAT, NITROCAT, as well as under the trade names or trademarks of several private label customers. These products are sold to retailers, distributors, manufacturers and private label customers through in-house sales personnel and manufacturers’ representatives. The AIRCAT and NITROCAT brands of pneumatic tools are sold primarily to the automotive service and repair market (“automotive market”). Users of Florida Pneumatic’s hand tools include industrial maintenance and production staffs, do-it-yourself mechanics, professional automobile mechanics and auto body personnel. Jiffy manufactures and distributes pneumatic tools and components primarily to aerospace manufacturers.
There are redundant supply sources for nearly all products purchased.
The primary competitive factors in the industrial and automotive pneumatic tool market are quality, breadth and availability of products, customer service, technical support, price, and brand name awareness. The primary competitive factors in the retail pneumatic tool market are price, service, and brand-name awareness.

Florida Pneumatic’s products are sold directly to the retailers, direct to customers and through distributors. Currently, there is minimal seasonality to Florida Pneumatic’s revenue.
Jiffy manufactures the majority of its products in the United States. It sources its raw materials from various well-established suppliers throughout the United States. There are redundant sources for all materials. During 2022, Florida Pneumatic sourced approximately 14% of its pneumatic tools from China, 9% come from Vietnam, and 71% from Taiwan with the balance from Japan, Europe and domestically. Florida Pneumatic performs final assembly on certain of its products at its factory in Jupiter, Florida.
