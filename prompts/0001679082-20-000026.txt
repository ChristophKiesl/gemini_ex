Overview
We are a healthcare company focused on redefining care for women and for men. Our lead product candidate is relugolix, a once-daily, oral, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (“GnRH”) receptor antagonist for which we have successfully completed multiple Phase 3 clinical studies across three distinct indications. We are preparing for potential commercial launches in the U.S. of relugolix combination tablet (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) for women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids or pain associated with endometriosis and relugolix monotherapy tablet (120 mg) for men with advanced prostate cancer, in anticipation of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval to market in these indications. We submitted our New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the FDA for relugolix monotherapy tablet for the treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer in April 2020, and currently expect to submit our NDA to the FDA for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in May 2020. We announced positive results from the first of two replicate Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating relugolix combination therapy in women with pain associated with endometriosis, and expect to announce top-line results from the second study in the second quarter of calendar year 2020. In addition, we are developing MVT-602, an oligopeptide kisspeptin-1 receptor agonist, for the treatment of female infertility as part of assisted reproduction. Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG (“Takeda”), a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, the originator of relugolix, granted us a worldwide license to develop and commercialize relugolix (excluding Japan and certain other Asian countries) and an exclusive right to develop and commercialize MVT-602 in all countries worldwide. On March 30, 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Gedeon Richter Plc. (“Richter”) for Richter to commercialize relugolix combination tablet for uterine fibroids and endometriosis in certain territories outside of the U.S. Under this agreement, we have retained all of our rights to relugolix combination tablet in the U.S. and Canada, as well as rights to relugolix in other therapeutic areas outside of women’s health. In March 2020, we submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application (“MAA”) to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for relugolix combination tablet in uterine fibroids. The MAA submission has completed validation and is now under evaluation by the EMA.
Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to identifying and in-licensing our product candidates, organizing and staffing our company, raising capital, preparing for and advancing the clinical development of our product candidates and preparing for potential future regulatory approvals and commercialization of relugolix combination tablet and relugolix monotherapy tablet.
On December 27, 2019, Sumitovant BioPharma Ltd. (“Sumitovant”), a subsidiary of Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. (“Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma”), became our majority shareholder and a related party after acquiring approximately 50.2% of our common shares outstanding on December 27, 2019. These common shares were acquired from our former majority shareholder, Roivant Sciences Ltd. (“Roivant,” “RSL,” or “former majority shareholder”) at the closing of a transaction between Roivant and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma. As of March 31, 2020, Sumitovant directly, and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma indirectly, own approximately 52.1% of our outstanding common shares. As a result of the transfer of these common shares, Roivant no longer beneficially owns any of our common shares.

Our Product Candidates
The following table summarizes the status of our relugolix and MVT-602 clinical programs and is followed by detailed descriptions of each program:
Relugolix
We are currently developing relugolix in three indications: heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids; pain associated with endometriosis; and advanced prostate cancer. Relugolix is an oral, once-daily, small molecule that acts as a GnRH 
receptor antagonist that binds to and inhibits GnRH receptors in the anterior pituitary gland. Inhibition of GnRH receptors decreases the release of gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone (“LH”) and follicle-stimulating hormone (“FSH”)), thereby decreasing the downstream production of estrogen and progesterone by the ovaries in women and testosterone by the testes in men. 
As a GnRH receptor antagonist, relugolix has a clinically-validated mechanism of action in each of our three targeted indications. The direct and rapid action of relugolix on the pituitary-gonadal axis is distinct from approved luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (“LHRH”) agonists which are administered as depot injections and result in an initial surge in levels of gonadotropins, and estrogen and progesterone or testosterone, before resulting in pituitary desensitization and a fall in hormone levels over weeks. Approved LHRH agonist injections such as leuprolide acetate are used in women to treat the symptoms of uterine fibroids and endometriosis, but the adoption and duration of use is limited due to bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms.
We are developing relugolix combination tablet (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) administered orally once-daily, with the goal of optimizing estradiol levels to achieve the long-term benefit of relugolix on symptoms of uterine fibroids and endometriosis, while maintaining bone health and mitigating side effects from a low-estrogen state, such as vasomotor symptoms. We have successfully completed a bioequivalence study, which demonstrated the bioequivalence of our relugolix combination tablet with relugolix combination therapy, the co-administered regimen used in the LIBERTY and SPIRIT clinical programs (one relugolix 40 mg tablet plus one tablet containing estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg). We expect to launch in the women’s health indications with our single-tablet regimen.
Lowering estrogen and progesterone levels has been demonstrated, including in our two replicate Phase 3 studies, to effectively decrease heavy menstrual bleeding and pain in women with uterine fibroids. Similarly, relugolix combination therapy has been demonstrated in the first of our two replicate Phase 3 studies to reduce pelvic pain associated with endometriosis. Relugolix combination therapy achieved these results while maintaining a generally well-tolerated safety profile. We believe our combination approach has the potential to have a better safety and tolerability profile than the currently approved LHRH agonist therapies and has the potential to be used longer-term. We further believe our single tablet combination approach also has certain benefits over other oral GnRH antagonist therapies that are currently approved or in development. The goal of our relugolix combination tablet is to provide women with uterine fibroids and endometriosis a once-daily oral medical alternative to hysterectomy and other invasive procedures often recommended to treat these conditions that is suitable for long-term use.
Decreasing testosterone slows the growth and progression of advanced prostate cancer, such as when the disease recurs or the prostate-specific antigen (“PSA”) is rising following prostatectomy or radiation therapy, when the disease progresses locally in the prostate bed, or when it becomes metastatic. We demonstrated in our Phase 3 HERO program that relugolix can achieve sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (< 50 ng/dL) through 48 weeks in 96.7% of patients with a once-daily oral treatment. Relugolix was compared to the standard-of-care leuprolide injections in the HERO study and demonstrated superiority to leuprolide in the cumulative proportion of patients achieving sustained testosterone suppression (96.7% vs 88.0%). Data from this study are the basis for the NDA submission for relugolix in advanced prostate cancer. We are developing a distinct therapeutic candidate, relugolix monotherapy (120 mg), for men with advanced prostate cancer which, if approved, we expect to commercialize as a separately branded product from our relugolix combination tablet.
Uterine Fibroids 
Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that develop in or on the muscular walls of the uterus and are among the most common reproductive tract tumors in women. In addition to an individual’s genetic predisposition, estrogens are well known to play an important role in the regulation of fibroid growth. Although uterine fibroids are benign tumors, they can cause debilitating symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, heavy or painful periods, anemia, abdominal pain, backache, increased abdominal girth and bloating, urinary frequency or retention, constipation or painful defecation, pregnancy loss, painful intercourse and, in some cases, infertility. These symptoms can also lead to loss of productivity at work, limitations in normal activities of daily living, and social embarrassment. For most women, uterine fibroids and associated symptoms resolve at menopause when estrogen and progesterone levels fall.
We estimate that over 25% of women of reproductive age in the U.S., or approximately 19 million women, have uterine fibroids. Of those, approximately five million women are estimated to experience symptoms of uterine fibroids, approximately three million of whom are inadequately treated by current medical therapy and require further treatment.
The current approach to treating uterine fibroids includes both medical and surgical options. The recommended treatment for a given patient is dependent on factors such as the patient’s desire to become pregnant in the future, the importance of uterine preservation, symptom severity, and tumor characteristics. Medical options include oral contraceptives, tranexamic acid, and LHRH agonists. The current standard of care for the treatment of patients with mild symptoms includes the use of oral or other hormonal contraceptives or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (“NSAIDs”), which are generally prescribed at the time of initial diagnosis. These therapeutic options, however, often do not provide sufficient relief to the many patients with more moderate-to-severe symptoms. These women require additional treatment to relieve excessive bleeding and pain. Tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, is approved for use to treat heavy menstrual bleeding. LHRH agonists are used for short-term therapy and 
may involve low-dose estradiol and progestin hormonal combination therapy to mitigate the side effect of bone mineral density loss and reduce vasomotor symptoms generally associated with LHRH agonists. Other invasive procedures such as endometrial ablation and uterine artery embolization may also be tried. Surgical intervention, such as myomectomy or hysterectomy, are often used to treat the heavy bleeding and symptoms associated with uterine fibroids; however, these procedures may result in post-operative complications, complications with future pregnancy, or, as is the case in hysterectomies, preclude the potential for future pregnancies. Even if a future pregnancy is not desired, many women prefer to avoid surgical intervention. However, heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids is a leading cause of hysterectomy, resulting in approximately 250,000 hysterectomies per year in the U.S. alone.
Our Phase 3 Program for the Treatment of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Associated with Uterine Fibroids
We initiated a Phase 3 clinical program in January 2017, evaluating relugolix combination therapy in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. The program consisted of two multinational, replicate pivotal clinical studies, which we refer to as LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2. Women in the LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 studies underwent a screening period requiring up to two menstrual cycles to document heavy menstrual bleeding and were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three groups. Women received treatment either with relugolix combination therapy for 24 weeks, relugolix 40 mg once-daily monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by relugolix combination therapy once-daily for an additional 12 weeks, or placebo once-daily for 24 weeks.
We enrolled 388 women in LIBERTY 1 and 382 women in LIBERTY 2. To be enrolled, women must have had a monthly menstrual blood loss volume of at least 80 mL in two consecutive cycles or 160 mL in one cycle, measured by the alkaline hematin method, a quantitative measure of menstrual blood loss from an assessment of collected menstrual products.
Eligible women who completed the LIBERTY 1 or LIBERTY 2 studies were offered the opportunity to enroll in an active treatment extension study in which all women receive relugolix combination therapy for an additional 28-week period for a total treatment period of 52 weeks, designed to evaluate the safety and sustained efficacy of longer-term treatment. Upon completion of this 52-week total treatment period, eligible women could elect to participate in a second 52-week randomized withdrawal study designed to provide two-year safety and efficacy data on relugolix combination therapy, and to evaluate the need for maintenance therapy. We are also conducting a one-year observational study of bone mineral density in women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis to provide additional context for our phase 3 clinical programs.
The primary efficacy endpoint for LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 was the proportion of all women enrolled who achieved a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and at least a 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss volume from baseline during the last 35 days of the 24-week treatment period as measured by the alkaline hematin method. The secondary endpoints included the proportion of women who achieved amenorrhea (defined as no or negligible blood loss) during the last 35 days of treatment, reduction in pelvic pain, reduction in fibroid volume, reduction in uterine volume, percent change from baseline to week 24 in menstrual blood loss, increase in hemoglobin, and an assessment of the impact of therapy on quality-of-life. Safety, including bone mineral density changes as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (“DXA”), was also assessed.
On May 14, 2019 and July 23, 2019, we announced top-line results for the LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 studies, respectively. In addition, on July 23, 2019, we announced that a separate clinical study of relugolix combination tablet met all required and pre-specified FDA criteria for bioequivalence, providing data necessary to include the one tablet, once-daily dosing regimen of relugolix combination tablet in the NDA submission for approval of the treatment for uterine fibroids. In December 2019, we successfully completed one-year stability studies, which are required for FDA approval of relugolix combination tablet. On February 10, 2020, we announced positive safety and efficacy data from the Phase 3 LIBERTY long-term extension study with an 87.7% response rate and, on average, an 89.9% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline.
On March 9, 2020, we announced the submission of a MAA to the EMA for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of women with moderate to severe symptoms associated with uterine fibroids. The application has completed validation and is now under evaluation by the EMA. We currently expect to submit an NDA to the FDA for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in May 2020.
LIBERTY 1
On May 14, 2019, we announced that LIBERTY 1, the first of two Phase 3 studies evaluating once-daily relugolix combination therapy in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, met its primary efficacy endpoint and six key secondary endpoints. Relugolix combination therapy maintained bone mineral density at levels comparable to placebo over 24 weeks and was generally well tolerated.
In the primary endpoint analysis, 73.4% of women receiving once-daily oral relugolix combination therapy achieved the responder criteria compared with 18.9% of women receiving placebo (p < 0.0001). A response was defined as a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and a 50 percent or greater reduction from baseline in menstrual blood loss volume during the last 35 days of the 24-week treatment period measured using the alkaline hematin method. On average, women receiving relugolix combination therapy experienced an 84.3% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline, a clinically relevant secondary endpoint.
Bone mineral density was comparable between the relugolix combination therapy and placebo groups. The distribution of the change in bone mineral density, including outliers, was similar for the relugolix combination therapy and placebo groups at 24 weeks, as assessed by DXA.
The 24-week study achieved six key secondary endpoints with statistical significance compared to placebo, including mean change in menstrual blood loss from baseline to week 24, reduction in pain in women with pain at baseline, improvement in quality of life, amenorrhea (defined as no or negligible blood loss), improvement in anemia in those women with anemia at baseline, and reduction in uterine volume. The seventh key secondary endpoint, reduction in uterine fibroid volume, did not achieve statistical significance. 
The overall incidence of adverse events in the relugolix combination therapy and placebo groups was comparable (62% vs. 66%). In the relugolix combination therapy group, 5% of women discontinued treatment early due to adverse events compared with 4% in the placebo group. The only adverse event in the relugolix combination therapy arm occurring in at least 10% of women and more frequently than in the placebo arm was hot flash (11% versus 8%). There were no pregnancies in the relugolix combination therapy group and one in the placebo group. There were two serious adverse events related to the study drug: one fibroid expulsion and one for pelvic pain.
LIBERTY 2
On July 23, 2019, we announced that LIBERTY 2, the second of two Phase 3 studies evaluating once-daily relugolix combination therapy in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, met its primary efficacy endpoint and the same six key secondary endpoints as were achieved in LIBERTY 1. Also as observed in LIBERTY 1, relugolix combination therapy maintained bone mineral density at levels comparable to placebo over 24 weeks and was generally well tolerated.
In the primary endpoint analysis, 71.2% of women receiving once-daily oral relugolix combination therapy achieved the responder criteria compared with 14.7% of women receiving placebo (p < 0.0001). A response was defined as a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in menstrual blood loss volume during the last 35 days of treatment measured using the alkaline hematin method. On average, women receiving relugolix combination therapy experienced a highly significant 84.3% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline to week 24 (p < 0.0001). In addition, a significantly greater proportion of women suffering from moderate-to-severe pain from uterine fibroids at baseline experienced no pain or minimal pain during the last 35 days of treatment with relugolix combination therapy compared with women on placebo (p < 0.0001).
Changes in bone mineral density were comparable between the relugolix combination therapy and placebo groups at the end of treatment. The distribution of the change in bone mineral density, including outliers, was similar for the relugolix combination therapy and placebo groups at 24 weeks, as assessed by DXA.
The 24-week study achieved six key secondary endpoints with statistical significance compared to placebo including mean change in menstrual blood loss from baseline to week 24, reduction in pain in women with pain at baseline, improvement in quality of life, amenorrhea (defined as no or negligible blood loss), improvement in anemia in those women with anemia at baseline, and a reduction in uterine volume. The seventh key secondary endpoint, reduction in uterine fibroid volume, did not achieve statistical significance.
The overall incidence of adverse events in the relugolix combination therapy and placebo groups was comparable (60.3% vs. 58.9%). In the relugolix combination therapy group, 1.6% of women discontinued treatment early due to adverse events compared with 4.7% in the placebo group. There were no adverse events in the relugolix combination therapy group reported by at least 10% of women and more frequently than in the placebo group. The incidence of hot flashes in the relugolix combination therapy group was similar to placebo (5.6% versus 3.9%). There were no pregnancies in the relugolix combination therapy group and one in the placebo group.
LIBERTY Long-Term Extension Study
On February 10, 2020, we announced positive safety and efficacy data from the Phase 3 LIBERTY long-term extension study of once-daily, oral relugolix combination therapy in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids.
In the primary endpoint analysis, 87.7% of women achieved the responder criteria defined as a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in menstrual blood loss volume during the last 35 days of treatment measured using the alkaline hematin method. The primary endpoint result in the Phase 3 LIBERTY long-term extension study was consistent with LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2, demonstrating a durability of response through one year. In addition, women experienced, on average, an 89.9% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline at one year.
Changes in bone mineral density through one year, as assessed by DXA every three months, demonstrated maintenance of bone density and were consistent with those in LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2. The adverse events over one year were consistent with those observed in LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2, with no new safety signals. Adverse events reported in more than 10% of women treated with relugolix combination therapy for one-year and more frequently than those reported in the placebo group after 6 months included only hot flashes. There were no pregnancies reported in the relugolix combination therapy group. 
Endometriosis 
Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent, inflammatory disease in which tissue that normally lines the uterus is found outside the uterine cavity. Endometriosis lesions commonly appear in the lower abdomen or pelvis or on ovaries, the bladder, or the colon. During the menstrual cycle, the lesions grow, differentiate, and shed into the abdomen, thereby inducing a cascade of inflammatory events. The symptoms associated with endometriosis can include painful periods and chronic pelvic pain, painful ovulation, pain during or after sexual intercourse, heavy bleeding, fatigue, and infertility. Endometriosis can also impact general physical, mental, and social well-being.
Endometriosis affects an estimated 10% of women during their reproductive years and, in the U.S., can take approximately 7-10 years from the onset of symptoms to accurately diagnose, often leading to unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. We estimate that approximately 6 million women in the U.S. suffer from symptomatic endometriosis, 1.2 million of whom are inadequately treated by oral contraceptives and require additional treatment.
Similar to uterine fibroids, lowering estrogen levels has been shown to reduce pain associated with endometriosis, and there are a variety of medical and surgical treatments available. Initial treatment usually involves over-the-counter pain medications, including NSAIDs, because pain is the primary symptom. Hormonal contraceptives are also commonly used. In more severe cases, LHRH agonists such as leuprolide are used for short-term treatment and may involve hormonal add-back therapy with an estrogen and/or a progestin. The FDA has approved Lupaneta Pack (leuprolide administered with norethindrone acetate (5 mg)) to treat pain associated with endometriosis while lowering the side effect of bone mineral density loss and reducing vasomotor symptoms. For many patients, surgical intervention, typically laparoscopy with ablation of endometriotic lesions, is ultimately undertaken to relieve pain, and opioid medications are frequently needed to control pain both before and after surgery. After treatment with hormonal therapy or laparoscopic procedures, recurrence of endometriosis and related symptoms is common, resulting in repeated procedures for many women. In addition, approximately 100,000 endometriosis-related hysterectomies are performed each year in the U.S., although hysterectomy is not a cure for endometriosis and pain associated with endometriosis will not necessarily subside following hysterectomy.
Our Phase 3 Program for the Treatment of Pain Associated with Endometriosis
We initiated a Phase 3 clinical program in June 2017, evaluating relugolix combination therapy in women with pain associated with endometriosis. The program consists of two multinational, replicate pivotal clinical studies, which we refer to as SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2. Each study randomized women 1:1:1 to one of three treatment arms. Women received treatment either with relugolix combination therapy for 24 weeks, relugolix 40 mg once-daily monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by relugolix combination therapy once-daily for an additional 12 weeks, or placebo once-daily for 24 weeks.
We completed patient recruitment into SPIRIT 2 in August 2019 and SPIRIT 1 in October 2019 and the enrollment of 623 and 638 patients in the SPIRIT 2 and SPIRIT 1 studies, respectively. To be enrolled, women must have had a surgical diagnosis of endometriosis in the last 10 years and moderate-to-severe dysmenorrhea (menstrual pelvic pain) and nonmenstrual pelvic pain.
Eligible women who completed the SPIRIT 1 or SPIRIT 2 studies were offered the opportunity to enroll in an active treatment extension study in which all women receive relugolix combination therapy for an additional 80-week period, resulting in a total treatment period of up to 104 weeks, designed to evaluate the safety and sustained efficacy of longer-term treatment. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints for the SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 studies are the proportion of all women enrolled with reductions in both dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain, as assessed by an endometriosis-specific patient questionnaire based on the Numerical Rating Scale (“NRS”) completed daily on an electronic patient diary, with no increase in background pain medication. The NRS is an 11-point scale with 0 representing “no pain” and 10 representing “the worst pain you can imagine.” Secondary endpoints include additional questionnaires assessing functional changes associated with endometriosis-specific pain and quality of life, and the use of pain medications to treat endometriosis, including opioid medications. Safety, including bone mineral density changes as measured by DXA, is assessed. 
On April 22, 2020, we announced top-line results from the SPIRIT 2 study. We expect to report top-line results from the SPIRIT 1 study in the second quarter of calendar year 2020.
SPIRIT 2
On April 22, 2020, we announced that SPIRIT 2, the first of two Phase 3 studies evaluating once-daily relugolix combination therapy in women with pain associated with endometriosis, met its co-primary efficacy endpoints and six key secondary endpoints. 
In addition, relugolix combination therapy was generally well-tolerated including minimal bone mineral density loss over 24 weeks.
In the co-primary endpoint analysis of SPIRIT 2, 75.2% of women receiving once-daily oral relugolix combination therapy achieved a clinically meaningful reduction in dysmenorrhea versus 30.4% of women in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). For nonmenstrual pelvic pain, relugolix combination therapy achieved a clinically meaningful reduction in 66.0% of women versus 42.6% of women in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). On average, women receiving relugolix combination therapy had a 75.1% reduction on the 11-point (0 to 10) NRS for dysmenorrhea from 7.2 (severe pain) to 1.7 (mild pain).
Six key secondary endpoints measured at Week 24 and compared to placebo achieved statistical significance, including changes in mean dysmenorrhea and overall pelvic pain, impact of pain on daily activities as measured by the Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP-30) pain domain, a greater proportion of women not using opioids (all p-values < 0.0001), changes in nonmenstrual pelvic pain (p = 0.0012), and dyspareunia (painful intercourse) (p = 0.0489). An endpoint evaluating change in analgesic use did not achieve statistical significance.
Relugolix combination therapy was generally well-tolerated with minimal bone mineral density loss over 24 weeks. The overall incidence of adverse events in the relugolix combination therapy and placebo groups was similar (80.6% vs. 75.0%). In the relugolix combination therapy group, 5.3% of women discontinued treatment early due to adverse events versus 3.9% in the placebo group. The most frequently reported adverse events, reported in at least 10% of women in the relugolix combination therapy group, were headache, nasopharyngitis, and hot flashes. There were three pregnancies in the relugolix combination therapy group and five in the placebo group.
Bioequivalence Study of Relugolix Combination Therapy and Relugolix Combination Tablet
On July 23, 2019, we announced that a separate clinical study of our relugolix combination tablet met all required and pre-specified criteria for bioequivalence to the two tablets (relugolix 40 mg plus estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) used in our Phase 3 uterine fibroid and endometriosis clinical studies, providing data necessary to include the once-daily dosing regimen of relugolix combination tablet in our NDA and MAA submissions for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and endometriosis.
Ovulation Inhibition Study
On April 22, 2020, we announced results from an open-label, single-arm ovulation inhibition study consisting of a pre-treatment period to confirm ovulatory status, an 84-day treatment period (three cycles) to assess the effects of relugolix combination therapy on ovulation inhibition, and a post-treatment follow-up period to determine the time to the return of ovulation. Ovulation inhibition was based on the Hoogland-Skouby scale. In this study, relugolix combination therapy achieved 100% ovulation inhibition in 67 healthy women with no women ovulating during the 84-day treatment period, as evaluated by the Hoogland-Skouby assessment scale (score < 5). Furthermore, 100% of women resumed ovulation or menses upon discontinuation of treatment with an average time to ovulation of 23.5 days.
Advanced Prostate Cancer 
Prostate cancer is the second most prevalent form of cancer in men and the second leading cause of death due to cancer in men in the U.S. Approximately 3 million men diagnosed with prostate cancer are alive in the U.S., and approximately 190,000 men are newly diagnosed each year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Men with prostate cancer are often asymptomatic at the earliest stages of disease and prostate cancer is generally understood to be slow to progress, leading to a median age at diagnosis of 66 years and a five-year survival rate of 98%.
If prostate cancer is diagnosed at a stage where it is confined to the prostate gland and immediate surroundings, it is generally treated by surgical removal of the prostate gland (prostatectomy) or with radiation. Often, these procedures are successful in curing men of their disease. Men whose disease progresses after prostatectomy or radiation are said to have advanced prostate cancer. Advanced prostate cancer is defined as any of the following: PSA biochemical relapse following primary surgical or radiation therapy of curative intent; newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer; or advanced localized disease for which immediate radiation or surgical therapy is not indicated.
First-line treatment for advanced prostate cancer typically involves treatment with androgen deprivation therapies (“ADT”), which are therapies that substantially reduce testosterone. This is because androgens, such as testosterone, promote the growth of cancerous prostate cells by binding to and activating the androgen receptor which, once activated, stimulates prostate cancer cell growth. ADT consisting of either medical castration or surgical castration (removal of the testes which produce testosterone) can be successful in delaying prostate cancer progression. As prostate cancer progresses, men remain on ADT while other therapies are added, typically until death.
The most commonly prescribed ADTs are LHRH agonists, such as long-acting leuprolide depot injections. LHRH agonists initially stimulate a testosterone surge, but with chronic stimulation of the LHRH receptors, the pituitary gland desensitizes and luteinizing hormone decreases with a resultant reduction in testosterone three to four weeks after the initiation of therapy. The initial stimulation of testosterone can cause an initial worsening of symptoms, or clinical flare. LHRH agonists are often given as depot formulations, requiring injections every month, three months or six months, and testosterone may remain suppressed for weeks and months after cessation of therapy.
Our Phase 3 Program for the Treatment of Advanced Prostate Cancer
We initiated a Phase 3 clinical study in March 2017, evaluating the safety and efficacy of relugolix monotherapy in men with advanced prostate cancer, which we refer to as the HERO study. The HERO study randomized 934 men with advanced prostate cancer who required ADT, in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with either oral relugolix 120 mg once-daily (after a single oral loading dose of 360 mg) or a depot injection of leuprolide (per national or regional product label) for a period of at least 48 weeks. Based on FDA discussions, we believe that we will be required to conduct only one Phase 3 study with a single relugolix arm to gain approval for relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer in the U.S. Nonetheless, we designed the study to include a second arm with leuprolide to demonstrate that treatment with relugolix is noninferior to leuprolide in achieving sustained suppression of testosterone to castrate levels over 48 weeks, an outcome expected to be required for approval in other major markets such as Europe and Japan.
We enrolled 934 men in the HERO study for the primary endpoint analysis. To be enrolled, men must have had advanced prostate cancer that required ADT for at least 48 weeks and included prostate cancer defined as biochemical or clinical relapse, advanced localized disease or newly diagnosed metastatic disease. Screening PSA was > 2.0 ng/mL and serum testosterone levels within the normal range. We filed an amendment to the HERO study protocol to enroll 139 additional men with metastatic prostate cancer and to add the secondary objective of demonstrating that relugolix can delay the time to progression to the lethal state of the disease, castration-resistant prostate cancer, as compared to leuprolide, that completed enrollment in July 2019. We believe that relugolix, a direct GnRH receptor antagonist, has the potential to delay the time to castration-resistant disease as compared with leuprolide, a LHRH agonist, because relugolix more rapidly suppresses testosterone and PSA and more fully suppresses FSH than leuprolide. We currently expect to report additional data from the HERO study measuring castration resistance-free survival in the cohort of 434 men with metastatic prostate cancer, comprising 295 men from the original HERO study and the additional cohort of 139 men, in the third quarter of calendar year 2020. We may conduct additional clinical studies to further support the commercial potential of relugolix in prostate cancer in the U.S. and other major markets.
The primary efficacy endpoint for HERO accepted by the FDA was testosterone suppression (< 50 ng/dL) from week 5, day 1 through week 48, day 7. Relugolix monotherapy was required to demonstrate that the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the percent of patients achieving testosterone suppression through 48 weeks was at least 90%. Testosterone suppression is an approvable endpoint in the U.S. and several hormonal therapies have been approved based on this endpoint. The secondary endpoints included rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of PSA at Day 15, and suppression of FSH at Week 24. Testosterone recovery was also evaluated in a subset of men eligible to discontinue ADT at the completion for the 48-week study treatment.
On November 19, 2019, we announced that the Phase 3 HERO study evaluating the safety and efficacy of once-daily, oral relugolix monotherapy over 48 weeks in 934 men with advanced prostate cancer met its primary efficacy endpoint with 96.7% (95% CI: 94.9%, 97.9%) of men achieving sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. The study also met all tested key secondary endpoints, while demonstrating 54% fewer major adverse cardiovascular events as compared with leuprolide injections administered every 3 months. The five key secondary endpoints also demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of PSA at Day 15, and suppression of FSH at Week 24 (all p-values < 0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%, 11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. Superiority to leuprolide was also achieved as the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference was greater than 0 (p-value < 0.0001). In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation in a subset of 184 patients.
The overall incidence of adverse events in the relugolix and leuprolide acetate groups was comparable (92.9% vs. 93.5%, respectively). In the relugolix group, 3.5% of men discontinued the study early due to adverse events compared with 2.6% of men in the leuprolide acetate group. The most frequently reported adverse events, reported in at least 10% of men in the relugolix group, were hot flashes, fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, and arthralgia (defined as pain in a joint). Major adverse cardiovascular events were reported in 2.9% of men in the relugolix group versus 6.2% of men in the leuprolide acetate group in a prespecified safety analysis. These events included non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and all-cause mortality and were not adjudicated.
On April 21, 2020, we announced the submission of an NDA to the FDA for relugolix monotherapy tablet for the treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer. New efficacy and cardiovascular safety data from our HERO study will be presented in an oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Virtual Scientific Program on May 29, 2020.
MVT-602
As part of our license agreement with Takeda (the “Takeda License Agreement”), we acquired the worldwide rights to MVT-602, our second product candidate, which previously had been evaluated in over 150 men. MVT-602 is an oligopeptide kisspeptin-1 receptor agonist. Kisspeptin, the ligand, is a naturally occurring peptide that stimulates GnRH release and is required for puberty and maintenance of normal reproductive function, including production of sperm, follicular maturation and ovulation, and production of estrogen and progesterone in women and testosterone in men. MVT-602 is being developed as a potential treatment for female infertility in women as part of assisted reproduction, such as in vitro fertilization (“IVF”). Approximately 1.5 million assisted reproduction cycles are performed each year worldwide. Further, approximately 25% of women suffering from infertility have problems achieving ovulation, including the inability to produce fully matured eggs or the failure to ovulate, most commonly resulting from hormonal dysfunction in the GnRH-luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone axis. We believe MVT-602 has the potential to be a safer alternative to human chorionic gonadotropin as a part of assisted reproduction for the treatment of female infertility.
We believe that MVT-602, an analog of the naturally-occurring kisspeptin peptide in humans, may mimic natural physiology by inducing a luteinizing hormone surge during IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies, enhancing the likelihood of successful egg maturation and ovulation at the right time without the serious side effect of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (“OHSS”). While assisted reproductive technologies are effective, typically resulting in pregnancy in 20% to 35% of patients, the standard procedure has remained largely unchanged since inception and has potentially serious side effects. The most serious side effect of assisted reproduction is OHSS. Severe OHSS has been reported to occur in up to 2% of the general assisted reproduction population, and in up to 20% of patients at high-risk for developing OHSS, including women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. OHSS is thought to occur as a result of the nonphysiologic elevations in luteinizing hormone that occur as a result of egg maturation triggered with human chorionic gonadotropin and to a lesser extent the GnRH receptor agonists. Symptoms can range from abdominal pain and bloating in milder cases to rapid weight gain, severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, blood clots, decreased urination, kidney failure, and shortness of breath.
By acting upstream in the GnRH-axis to promote the release of physiologically normal levels of key hormones in the assisted reproduction cycle such as luteinizing hormone, kisspeptin agonists, such as MVT-602, may have the potential to trigger egg maturation without causing OHSS. A recently published investigator-sponsored study, where a native kisspeptin peptide (specifically, kisspeptin 54) was used in place of human chorionic gonadotropin as the egg-maturation trigger in the assisted reproduction cycle, showed that none of the 60 high-risk patients developed moderate-to-severe OHSS and resulted in a live birth rate of up to 65.1% at the maximally efficacious dose tested. These results validate the potential use of kisspeptin analogs as an alternative to the standard egg maturation trigger in assisted reproduction protocols. To our knowledge, MVT-602 is the only kisspeptin-1 receptor agonist in clinical development and thus has the potential to become a safe alternative egg-maturation trigger in this space.
In October 2018, we presented data from a Phase 1 study of MVT-602 at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (“ASRM”) Annual Congress. Results of the study showed that administration of MVT-602 in healthy premenopausal women in the follicular phase produced a dose-related increase in LH concentrations and expected effects on FSH and estradiol. A total of 24 women were randomized to one of three MVT-602 dose groups (0.3 µg, 1 µg or 3 µg) and then subsequently randomized within the assigned group to receive a single subcutaneous dose of MVT-602 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Results showed that administration of single subcutaneous doses of MVT-602 demonstrated dose-related increases in LH concentrations and expected post-dose increases in FSH and estradiol concentrations, with little effect observed on progesterone as expected. No serious adverse events were reported, and no subject discontinued from the study due to an adverse event. Adverse events were similar between the placebo and MVT-602 groups with no apparent dose-related effects.
Further assessment of the exposure-response profile of MVT-602 was conducted in a Phase 2a study during the pre-ovulatory phase in 75 fertile women following a minimal controlled ovarian stimulation protocol. After ovarian stimulation, women were randomized to one of four MVT-602 dose groups (0.1 µg, 0.3 µg, 1 µg or 3 µg), to triptorelin, 0.2 mg, or to placebo. Top-line results from this Phase 2a study were presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Vienna, Austria in June 2019. The study demonstrated that MVT-602 was generally well-tolerated and produced the desired LH surge associated with high and dose-dependent rates of ovulation in healthy women following a minimal controlled ovarian stimulation protocol. This study provides information for dose selection for a future study of MVT-602 in infertile women seeking pregnancy. 
Our Key Agreements
Takeda Agreements
Takeda License Agreement
On April 29, 2016, we entered into the Takeda License Agreement pursuant to which Takeda granted to us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by Takeda to develop and commercialize relugolix and MVT-602, and products containing these compounds for all human diseases and conditions. The territory for our exclusive license for relugolix covers all countries worldwide, except that Takeda retains exclusive rights to Japan, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam (including, in each case, the territories and possession of each of the foregoing), which we collectively refer to as the Takeda Territory.

The territory for our exclusive license for MVT-602 covers all countries worldwide. Our license includes a right of reference to regulatory materials related to relugolix and MVT-602 controlled by Takeda. On May 31, 2018, Takeda announced that they entered into a licensing agreement granting ASKA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. exclusive commercialization rights for uterine fibroids and exclusive development and commercialization rights for endometriosis in Japan.
Under the Takeda License Agreement, we granted to Takeda an exclusive, royalty-bearing license in the Takeda Territory under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by us to develop and commercialize relugolix and products containing relugolix for all human diseases and conditions, subject to our nonexclusive rights to conduct development and manufacturing as described above. We also granted to Takeda a nonexclusive license in our territory to manufacture relugolix and MVT-602; and to conduct development of relugolix for uterine fibroids and endometriosis solely for the purpose of developing, manufacturing and commercializing relugolix in the Takeda Territory. Takeda’s license includes a right of reference to regulatory materials controlled by us. If Takeda determines not to seek regulatory approval for or to commercialize relugolix in any country in the Takeda Territory, then we have a right of first negotiation to acquire the rights to seek regulatory approval and commercialize relugolix in such country.
We are solely responsible, at our expense, for all activities related to the development of relugolix and MVT-602 in our territory and all activities related to the development of relugolix through the receipt of regulatory approval for prostate cancer in certain countries in the Takeda Territory. Pursuant to the terms of the Takeda License Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval of relugolix for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids or endometriosis and MVT-602 in our territory, as well as to develop and obtain regulatory approval of relugolix for prostate cancer in Japan and the U.S. We are solely responsible, at our expense, for all activities related to the commercialization of relugolix and MVT-602 in our territory and must use commercially reasonable efforts to do so in each country in our territory in which we obtain regulatory approval. Takeda is solely responsible, at its expense, for all activities related to the commercialization of relugolix in the Takeda Territory, and must use diligent efforts to commercialize relugolix for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory following receipt of regulatory approval.
Under the Takeda License Agreement, we will pay Takeda a fixed, high single-digit royalty on net sales of relugolix and MVT-602 products in our territory, subject to certain agreed reductions. Takeda will pay us a royalty at the same rate as ours on net sales of relugolix products for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory, subject to certain agreed reductions. Royalties are required to be paid, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest to occur of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering such product in such country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country, or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. Under the Takeda License Agreement, there was no upfront payment and there are no payments upon the achievement of clinical development or marketing approval milestones. We have also licensed additional patents and patent applications from Takeda directed to other oligopeptides that target the same pathway as MVT-602.
The Takeda License Agreement will expire, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, on the expiration of the royalty payment term described above for such product in such country. Either party may terminate the Takeda License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach, challenge to the patents licensed under the Takeda License Agreement, or insolvency. Takeda may terminate the Takeda License Agreement with respect to a compound if we cease development or commercialization of such compound. We may terminate the agreement at will, in our sole discretion, in its entirety, or with respect to relugolix for prostate cancer or both endometriosis and uterine fibroids, or on a compound by compound basis for all fields, upon prior notice, with the notice period depending on the compound and field to be terminated and the regulatory status at the time that notice of termination is given. We may also terminate the agreement with respect to a compound for safety reasons or lack of commercial viability. If the agreement is terminated in its entirety or with respect to relugolix for prostate cancer, other than for safety reasons or by us for Takeda’s uncured material breach, prior to receipt of the first regulatory approval of relugolix for prostate cancer in Japan, then we must either reimburse Takeda for its out of pocket costs and expenses directly incurred in connection with Takeda’s completion of the relugolix development for prostate cancer, up to an agreed cap, or complete ourselves the conduct of any clinical 
studies of relugolix for prostate cancer that are ongoing as of the effective date of such termination, at our cost and expense. If we reimburse Takeda for such costs, then under certain circumstances we may be later reimbursed by Takeda through a royalty on sales of the terminated relugolix product.
Takeda Supply Agreements
In June 2016, we and one of Takeda’s affiliates, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda Limited”) entered into an agreement for the manufacture and supply of relugolix. Under this agreement, Takeda Limited supplied us with, and we have obtained from Takeda Limited, all of our requirements for relugolix drug substance and drug product that were used under our development plans for all indications.
On May 30, 2018, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Takeda (the “Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement”) pursuant to which Takeda has manufactured and supplied us with relugolix drug substance to support the commercial launch of relugolix, if marketing authorization is granted. Takeda has also assisted with the transfer of technology and manufacturing know-how to a second contract manufacturing organization of our subsidiary, Myovant Sciences GmbH. This second contract manufacturing organization for relugolix drug substance will be included in our regulatory submissions for all potential indications.
The initial term of the Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement began on May 30, 2018 and will continue for five years. At the end of the initial term, the Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms, unless either party gives notice of termination to the other at least 12 months prior to the end of the then-current term. The Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement may be terminated by either party upon 90 days’ notice of an uncured material breach of its terms by the other party, or immediately upon notice to the other party of a party’s bankruptcy. Each party will also have the right to terminate the Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement, in whole or in part, for any reason upon 180 days’ prior written notice to the other party, provided that any then-open purchase orders will remain in effect and be binding on both parties. The Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement, including any then-open purchase orders thereunder, will terminate immediately upon the termination of the Takeda License Agreement in accordance with its terms.
The Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement also includes customary provisions relating to, among others, delivery, inspection procedures, warranties, quality management, storage, handling and transport, intellectual property, confidentiality and indemnification.
Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Agreements
Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement
On December 27, 2019, we and our subsidiary, Myovant Sciences GmbH, entered into a Loan Agreement with Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma (the “Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement”). Pursuant to the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma agreed to make revolving loans to us in the aggregate principal amount of up to $400.0 million. Funds may be drawn down by us once per calendar quarter, subject to certain terms and conditions, including consent of our board of directors. In addition, if Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma fails to own at least a majority of our outstanding common shares, it may become unlawful under Japanese law for Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma to fund loans to us, in which case we would not be able to continue to borrow under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement. Interest is due and payable quarterly, and the outstanding principal amounts are due and payable in full on the five-year anniversary of the closing date of the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement. Loans under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement are prepayable at any time without premium or penalty upon 10 business days’ prior written notice.
Loans under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin of 3.0% payable on the last day of each calendar quarter. Our obligations under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries. The loans and other obligations are senior unsecured obligations of us, Myovant Sciences GmbH, and subsidiary guarantees. The Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement includes customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants.
The Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, cross acceleration to certain other debt, failure to pay certain final judgments, certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, failure of material provisions of the loan documents to remain in full force and effect or any contest thereto by us or any of our subsidiaries and certain breaches by us under the Investor Rights Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% will apply to the outstanding principal amount of the loans, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma may terminate its obligations to make loans to us and declare the principal amount of loans to become immediately due and payable, and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma may take such other actions as set forth in the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement. Upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, the obligations of Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma to make loans to us would automatically terminate and the principal amount of the loans would automatically become due and payable. In addition, if it becomes unlawful 
for Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma to maintain the loans under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement or within 30 days of a change of control with respect to us, we would be required to repay the outstanding principal amount of the loans.
Investor Rights Agreement
On December 27, 2019, we entered into an Investor Rights Agreement with Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma and Sumitovant (the “Investor Rights Agreement”). Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, among other things, we agreed, at the request of Sumitovant, to register for sale, under the Securities Act of 1933, common shares beneficially owned by Sumitovant, subject to specified conditions and limitations. In addition, we agreed to periodically provide Sumitovant (i) certain financial statements, projections, capitalization summaries and other information and (ii) access to our books, records, facilities and employees during our normal business hours as Sumitovant may reasonably request, subject to specified limitations. 
The Investor Rights Agreement also contains certain protections for our minority shareholders for so long as Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma or certain of its affiliates beneficially owns more than 50% of our common shares. These protections include: (i) a requirement that Sumitovant vote its shares for the election of independent directors in accordance with the recommendation of our board of directors (the “board”) or in the same proportion as the shareholders not affiliated with Sumitovant vote their shares; (ii) a requirement that the audit committee of our board be composed solely of three independent directors; (iii) a requirement that any transaction proposed by Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma or certain of its affiliates that would increase Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma’s beneficial ownership to over 60% of the outstanding voting power of us must be approved by our audit committee (if occurring prior to December 27, 2022) and be conditioned on the approval of shareholders not affiliated with Sumitovant approving the transaction by a majority of the common shares held by such shareholders; and (iv) a requirement that any related person transactions between Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma or certain of its affiliates and us must be approved by our audit committee.
Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, we also agreed that at all times that Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma beneficially owns more than 50% of our common shares, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, by purchasing common shares in the open market or from us in certain specified circumstances, will have the right to maintain its percentage ownership in our common shares in the event of a financing event or acquisition event conducted by us, or specified other events, subject to specific conditions.
Roivant Sciences Ltd.
As a result of the closing of the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma-Roivant Agreement, on December 27, 2019 all of our outstanding common shares held directly or indirectly by Roivant and not already held by Sumitovant were transferred to Sumitovant, and Roivant transferred all of the outstanding equity of Sumitovant to Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma. As a result of the transfer of these common shares, Roivant no longer beneficially owns any of our common shares. On December 27, 2019, in connection with the closing of the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma-Roivant Agreement, the then existing Information Sharing and Cooperation Agreement between us and Roivant, the then existing Services Agreements between us and certain of our subsidiaries and Roivant and certain of its subsidiaries, and the then existing Option Agreement between us and Roivant were terminated.
Under the Services Agreements, we paid or reimbursed Roivant or its subsidiaries for expenses it, or third parties acting on their behalf, incurred for us or our subsidiaries. For any general and administrative (“G&A”) and research and development (“R&D”) activities performed by Roivant or its subsidiaries’ employees for the benefit of us, we were charged based on the relative percentage of time utilized on our matters by the respective employee. All other third-party pass-through costs were billed to us at cost. In addition, Roivant previously allocated share-based compensation expense to us based upon the relative percentage of time spent by Roivant and its subsidiaries’ employees on our matters.
Development and Commercialization Agreement with Richter
On March 30, 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Richter for Richter to commercialize relugolix combination tablet for uterine fibroids and endometriosis in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States including Russia, Latin America, Australia, and New Zealand. Under the terms of the agreement, we will continue to lead global development of relugolix combination tablet. Richter will be responsible for local clinical development, manufacturing, and all commercialization activities for its territories. We have also agreed to assist Richter in transferring manufacturing technology from our contract manufacturing organizations to Richter to enable Richter to manufacture relugolix combination tablet. If requested by Richter, we have agreed to supply Richter with quantities of relugolix combination tablet for its territories pursuant to our agreements with our contract manufacturing organizations. We have also granted Richter an option to collaborate on relugolix combination tablet for future indications in women’s health other than fertility. We have retained all of our rights to relugolix combination tablet in the U.S. and Canada, as well as rights to relugolix in other therapeutic areas outside of women’s health.
Right of First Negotiation and Board Observer Agreement with Pfizer
In October 2016, we and an entity affiliated with Pfizer Inc. (the “Pfizer Affiliate”) entered into a right of first negotiation and board observer agreement (the “Pfizer Agreement”), pursuant to which we granted to the Pfizer Affiliate a right of first negotiation with respect to certain license or sale of rights to develop and commercialize relugolix or MVT-602 or a change of control of 
Myovant or a sale of substantially all of our assets. In addition, during the period that the Pfizer Affiliate held such right of first negotiation, one representative of the Pfizer Affiliate was entitled to attend any meetings of our board of directors in a non-voting observer capacity, subject to standard exceptions, such as conflict of interest. The right of first negotiation terminated on November 1, 2019 (the third anniversary of our initial public offering).
Sales and Marketing
We believe that we can maximize the value of our products by retaining substantial commercialization rights to our product candidates and, where appropriate, enter into collaborations for specific therapeutic indications or geographic territories. We intend to directly commercialize relugolix in the U.S. in women’s health and prostate cancer and we are currently building our sales and marketing infrastructure. In other markets for which commercialization may be less capital efficient for us, we may selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties as we have done with Richter for certain territories outside the U.S. In order to commercialize our product candidates and maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, we must further develop our sales and marketing infrastructure and/or collaborate with third-parties that have sales and marketing capabilities.
We are currently planning to establish separate, but efficient, sales teams for women’s health and prostate cancer. In women’s health, we intend to focus primarily on gynecology practices as this specialty accounts for the majority of treatments of both uterine fibroids and endometriosis. With a team of approximately 200 sales representatives, we estimate that we can effectively cover 70% of the market opportunity in these two disease areas. For our prostate cancer product launch, we intend to focus on both urologists and medical oncologists, as both specialties are heavy prescribers of ADT. As this market is even more concentrated, we anticipate utilizing a sales team of approximately 100 sales representatives.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, nor do we expect to own or operate, facilities for manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing of our product candidates.
If there are delays in initiating new relationships with one or more other third-party manufacturers for relugolix and/or MVT-602, or if there are delays in completing technology transfer to any of these manufacturers, or if any of our third-party manufacturers experience adverse developments, including with respect to adverse findings during inspections and/or the COVID-19 pandemic, we could experience delays in our development and commercialization efforts.
Manufacturing of any product candidate is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. We expect that all of our contract manufacturing organizations will manufacture relugolix and MVT-602 under current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) conditions, which set forth the regulatory standards for the production of pharmaceuticals to be used in humans.
Relugolix Development
In June 2016, we and Takeda Limited entered into an agreement for the manufacture and supply of relugolix. Under this agreement, Takeda Limited supplied us with, and we have obtained from Takeda Limited, all of our requirements for relugolix drug substance and drug product that were used under our development plans for all indications. We expect that the manufacturing support provided by Takeda to us under the Takeda License Agreement will be sufficient for us to complete our Phase 3 programs for relugolix. We also rely on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for packaging and distribution of finished drug products for our clinical studies, sourcing of comparator products, and development of new products.
Relugolix Commercialization
If relugolix is approved for marketing, we plan to rely on Takeda and other third-party manufacturers to supply us with sufficient commercial quantities of relugolix combination tablets and relugolix monotherapy tablets. On May 30, 2018, we entered into the Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement pursuant to which Takeda has manufactured and supplied us with some of the relugolix drug substance to support the commercial launch of relugolix, if marketing authorization is granted. Takeda has assisted us with the transfer of technology and manufacturing know-how to a second contract manufacturing organization of our subsidiary, Myovant Sciences GmbH. This second contract manufacturing organization for relugolix drug substance will be included in our regulatory submissions for all potential indications. In anticipation of receiving marketing approval by a regulatory agency for any of our product candidates, we have also entered into additional agreements with other third-party contract manufacturing organizations for the commercial production of those products. Under the Development and Commercialization Agreement with Richter, we have agreed to supply Richter with sufficient quantities of relugolix combination tablet, if requested by Richter, for commercialization in Richter’s territories.
MVT-602
We have contracted with third-party contract manufacturers to complete the additional development and manufacturing activities for our current MVT-602 programs and to fill, finish, supply, store, and distribute drug product for these programs.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and require an ongoing, extensive search for technological innovation. These industries are characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our product candidates, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon our ability to effectively complete necessary clinical studies and regulatory approval processes, and effectively commercialize, market, and promote approved products. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any product candidate for which we may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, acceptance by physicians, ease of patient compliance, dosing convenience, price, insurance and other reimbursement coverage, patent position, distribution, and marketing. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Many of our existing or potential future competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Our current and certain potential future competitors also have significantly more experience in manufacturing and commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaboration agreements with larger more established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales force, and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient enrollment and retention for clinical studies. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. 
Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for uterine fibroids, endometriosis or prostate cancer by a competitor could render our product candidates non-competitive or obsolete or reduce the demand for our product candidates before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses. 
We consider relugolix’s most direct competitor for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and for pain associated with endometriosis to be ORILISSA™ (elagolix), an oral GnRH receptor antagonist, which has been approved as monotherapy (150 mg once a day or 200 mg twice a day) by the FDA and launched by AbbVie in August 2018 for the management of moderate-to-severe pain associated with endometriosis. Abbvie has one ongoing Phase 3b study of elagolix in combination with hormonal therapy in women with pain associated with endometriosis. In 2018, AbbVie announced that each of its two pivotal Phase 3 studies evaluating elagolix 300 mg twice a day with and without hormonal add-back therapy in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, met their primary endpoint and subsequently in August 2019 submitted an NDA to the FDA. In addition, ObsEva SA, a Swiss-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, reported the commencement of two Phase 3 clinical studies of linzagolix (OBE2109), also an oral GnRH receptor antagonist, in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in the first half of 2017 and announced in December 2019 positive results from the first of these studies. In May 2019, ObsEva also initiated a Phase 3 program evaluating linzagolix in women with endometriosis-associated pain, however new patient screening and randomization in this study has been put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe the development of multiple GnRH receptor antagonists by other biopharmaceutical companies adds further validation to the therapeutic relevance of GnRH as a target for the treatment of women’s health and endocrine diseases and will help fuel growth in this market which has lacked innovative new medical therapies.
Relugolix is the only oral GnRH receptor antagonist in development for men with prostate cancer. LHRH agonists, such as leuprolide acetate, are the standard of care treatment used to lower testosterone in men with advanced prostate cancer. These have been approved for three decades and are administered by injection on a monthly, quarterly or every 6-month basis and are expected to be the direct competitor for relugolix. Degarelix, a depot GnRH antagonist requiring monthly injections, is approved for use to lower testosterone in men with advanced prostate cancer, but clinical use is limited likely by the requirement for monthly high-volume injections with a rate of injection site reactions of approximately 35%. A phase 3 prospective cardiovascular study is currently underway evaluating the benefit of degarelix versus LHRH agonist therapy on the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in men with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. The study is no longer recruiting patients and is expected to report data in April 2021 according to clinicaltrials.gov. Other oral medications used for androgen deprivation therapy include androgen receptor inhibitors such as enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide, androgen biosynthesis inhibitors such as 
abiraterone acetate, and antiandrogens such as bicalutamide and flutamide, each commonly used in combination with a GnRH receptor antagonist or LHRH agonist.
In addition to other GnRH receptor antagonists and selective progesterone receptor modulators in active development, we are aware of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies as well as academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions that are developing, and may in the future develop and commercialize, products for gender-specific hormone disorders.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for relugolix, MVT-602 and any of our future product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing and in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Generally, issued patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, patent terms can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) in examining the patent application (patent term adjustment (“PTA”)) or extended to account for term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period (patent term extension (“PTE”)), or both. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect our products or product candidates.
Under the Takeda License Agreement, we are the exclusive licensee of multiple granted U.S. patents, and pending patent applications, as well as patents and patent applications in numerous foreign jurisdictions relating to relugolix and MVT-602. 
For relugolix, we are the exclusive worldwide licensee, excluding the Takeda Territory. These patents and patent applications cover the relugolix molecule and certain analogs and the use of relugolix to treat sex-hormone dependent prostate cancer and hysteromyoma (uterine fibroids); methods of manufacturing; and certain formulations. The patent family directed to the relugolix molecule and its use will expire in 2024, subject to any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. We intend to apply for PTE for a patent covering relugolix. If granted, the term of this patent may be extended for up to five years, or 2029. The patents and patent applications, if issued, directed to methods of manufacturing relugolix will expire in 2033, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. The patents and patent applications, if issued, directed to formulations of relugolix will expire in 2036, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. We have filed patent applications directed to uses of relugolix combination therapy in treating, among other conditions, heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and for pain associated with endometriosis. These applications are co-owned with Takeda under the Takeda License Agreement. If issued, they will expire in 2037 not including any adjustments or extensions. We have also filed patent applications directed to the use of relugolix as a monotherapy to treat advanced prostate cancer. The granted U.S. patent, and patent applications in this patent family, if issued, will expire in 2037, not including any adjustments or extensions. These patents and patent applications are also co-owned with Takeda.
For MVT-602, we are the exclusive worldwide licensee of multiple patents and patent applications in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. These patents and patent applications cover the MVT-602 oligopeptide and its use in treating advanced prostate cancer, as well as certain sustained release formulations containing MVT-602. The patent family directed to the MVT-602 molecule and method of use expires in 2028 in the U.S. (because of PTA) and in 2026 ex-U.S., subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. The patents and patent applications directed to sustained-release formulations of MVT-602, if issued, would expire between 2030 and 2031, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. We intend to apply for PTE for a patent covering MVT-602. If granted, the patent term covering MVT-602 may be extended. We are also the owner of patent applications directed to uses of MVT-602 in treating infertility. These applications, if issued, would expire in 2037 subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. We have licensed additional patents and patent applications from Takeda directed to other oligopeptides that target the same pathway as MVT-602.
In addition to patents, we also rely upon trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We maintain both registered and common law trademarks. Common law trademark protection typically continues where and for as long as the mark is used. Registered trademarks continue in each country for as long as the trademark is registered. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Obtaining patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have or obtain rights to patents which could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.
Government Regulation
FDA Drug Approval Process 
In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
The process required before drugs may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;


• | submission of an NDA to the FDA for commercial marketing, or of a supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) for approval of a new indication if the product is already approved for another indication;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements and selected clinical investigators or contract research organizations for their compliance with GCP;


• | if the FDA convenes an advisory committee, satisfactory completion of the advisory committee review; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or sNDA.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, which may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. 
Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical study protocol. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical study. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical study can begin. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical study conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical study must review and approve the plan for any clinical study and provide its informed consent form before the study commences at that center. Regulatory authorities or an IRB or the study sponsor may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
Clinical studies to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. 

• | Phase 1- Studies, which involve the initial introduction of the new drug product candidate into humans, are initially conducted in a limited number of subjects to assess pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness.


• | Phase 2- Studies are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specified disease in order to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical studies may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical studies.


• | Phase 3- Phase 3 studies, also called pivotal or registration studies, are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical study sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical study with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter study demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and where confirmation of the result in a second study would be practically or ethically impossible.

The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical studies after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be deemed a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. Failure to satisfy such post-marketing commitments can result in FDA enforcement action, up to and including withdrawal of NDA approval.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing, and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program user fees.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months of the filing date or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication and is granted priority review, six months from the filing date. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug candidate is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA may refer applications to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or some of the facilities at which the drug is manufactured or tested.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.
As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include a medication guide, a communication plan for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, such as special training and certification requirements for individuals who prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry, and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in formulation, indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or sNDA before the change can be implemented. An sNDA for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing an sNDA as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Post-Approval Requirements 
Any products for which we may receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, REMS, or surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or restrictions on the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to GMP requirements after approval, including for supply chain traceability. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with GMP requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with GMP requirements. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacture of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical studies;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

Foreign Regulation 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical studies and the manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products outside the U.S. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union (“EU”). Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the U.S. apply similarly in the context of foreign countries and the EU, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be shorter or longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Although we currently do not have any products approved for marketing, our current and future business operations may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting, and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to some of these laws. 
Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate compliance policies, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee or third-party misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs designed to establish internal control and facilitate compliance can mitigate the risk of violating these laws, and the subsequent investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements, 
and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Anti-Kickback Laws
U.S. federal laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the Department of Justice, and the Office of the Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), and various state agencies. These anti-kickback laws, among other things, make it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item, or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including cash, gifts or gift certificates, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. 
Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
Federal and State Prohibitions on False Claims
The federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Many states have enacted similar laws modeled after the federal civil False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to all payors. 
Federal Prohibitions on Healthcare Fraud and False Statements Related to Healthcare Matters
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created new federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA broadened the reach of certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA by amending the intent requirement such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
Healthcare Privacy and Security Laws
Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and their implementing regulations, impose specific requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individual identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. At present, it is unclear if we would be considered a business associate subject to HIPAA based on our business activities and service offerings upon the commercialization of a product. In addition, certain state and foreign laws, regulations, standards and regulatory guidance govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
We have conducted, and may continue to conduct, clinical studies or continue to enroll subjects in our ongoing or future clinical studies in certain jurisdictions in which we may be subject to additional privacy restrictions. For example, the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating 
to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. Data protection authorities from the different EU member states have issued limited guidance, may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and may impose additional requirements, which complicates the effort to comply with these laws. Further, the United Kingdom’s vote in favor of exiting the EU, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom (“UK”). In particular, it is unclear how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated.
Additionally, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of California consumers and households. The CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, gives California residents expanded rights to access and requires deletion of their personal information, opting out of certain personal information sharing, and receiving detailed information about how their personal information is collected, used and shared. The California Attorney General will commence enforcement actions against violators beginning July 1, 2020. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Although the CCPA includes exemptions for certain clinical studies data, as well as HIPAA protected health information, the law may increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal information we collect about California residents. The CCPA has prompted a wave of proposals for new federal and state privacy legislation that, if passed, could increase our potential liability, increase our compliance costs, and adversely affect our business.
Physician Payments Sunshine Act
There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The ACA through the enactment of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, imposes, among other things, annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
Many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures, or drug pricing, as well as state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Additionally, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, (“FCPA”), which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity to obtain a business advantage. The FCPA also requires public companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of suppliers, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses or permits, and legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or governmental investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. 
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our future results of operations and our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, even if approved for sale. Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality, and/or expanding access. 
There has been increasing legislation and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to drug pricing practices. At the federal level, the U.S. Presidential administration’s budget proposal for the fiscal year 2021 includes a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. In addition, there have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries, hearings and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things: reduce or limit the prices of drugs; reform the structure of Medicare Part D pharmaceutical benefits; bring more transparency to drug pricing rationale and methodologies; and facilitate the importation of certain lower-cost drugs from other countries, expedite the development and approval of generic drugs and biosimilars. Although a number of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the U.S. Presidential administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including restrictions on pricing or reimbursement at the state government level, limitations on discounts to patients, marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, policies to encourage importation from other countries (subject to federal approval) and bulk purchasing. 
The U.S. pharmaceutical industry has been significantly impacted by major legislative initiatives and related political contests, including, for example, efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. Notably, in December 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the penalty for enforcing the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Then in December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld this District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case, and has allotted one hour for oral arguments, which are expected to occur in the fall. It is unclear how this litigation and other efforts will impact the ACA.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 (“BCA”), which began in 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BCA, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which was designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the Medicare sequester reductions from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of our products, if and when approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, private health insurers, and managed care organizations. Third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will cover and establish certain reimbursement levels for such drugs. In particular, in the U.S., private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products, if and when approved, unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will be paid by third-party payors. Additionally, the market for our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ formularies without prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will likely be a time-consuming process.
Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs (including drug prices) has become a priority of federal and state governments. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution by generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive 
policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products once approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products once approved or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
In June 2016, the electorate in the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” Following protracted negotiations, the UK left the EU on January 31, 2020. The UK and the EU entered into a transition period of 11 months which may be extended once by agreement of the UK and the EU before July 2020 for up to one or two years. However, the transition agreement between the two parties means that the UK will abide by current regulatory and trading frameworks at least until December 31, 2020 pending the agreement of their future relationship. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the UK covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical studies, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime that applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the UK. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, may force us to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the UK and/or EU for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.
The UK’s vote to exit the EU could also result in similar referendums or votes in other European countries in which we conduct business. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the UK from the EU will have and how such withdrawal may affect us.
