General
 
Charles & Colvard, Ltd., a North Carolina corporation founded in 1995 (which may be referred to as Charles & Colvard, we, us, or our), manufactures, markets, and distributes Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® (which we refer to as moissanite or moissanite jewels) and finished jewelry featuring moissanite for sale in the worldwide jewelry market. Moissanite, also known by its chemical name silicon carbide (SiC), is a rare mineral first discovered in a meteorite crater. Because naturally occurring SiC crystals are too small for commercial use, larger crystals must be grown in a laboratory. Leveraging our advantage of being the original and leading worldwide source of created moissanite, our strategy is to establish Charles & Colvard with reputable, high-quality, and sophisticated brands across multiple channels, and to position moissanite as an ethically-sourced, affordable, and luxurious alternative to other gemstones such as diamond. We believe this is possible due to moissanite’s exceptional brilliance, fire, durability, and rarity like no other jewel available on the market. We sell loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry at wholesale to distributors, manufacturers, retailers, TV shopping networks, and designers, and at retail to end consumers through our wholly owned operating subsidiaries, charlesandcolvard.com, LLC (formerly Moissanite.com, LLC) and Charles & Colvard Direct, LLC (until March 2016), and through third-party marketplaces. As of September 30, 2016, we changed the name of our wholly owned subsidiary Moissanite.com, LLC to charlesandcolvard.com, LLC.

In February 2016, we made the strategic decision to explore a potential divestiture of our direct-to-consumer home party business previously operated through our Charles & Colvard Direct, LLC (dba Lulu Avenue®) subsidiary. After careful analysis of our core competencies, go-to-market strategies, and intent to advance toward profitability, the management team and Board of Directors determined a divestiture of this distribution channel to be in our best interest and our shareholders’ best interest. On March 4, 2016, we and Charles & Colvard Direct, LLC entered into an asset purchase agreement with Yanbal USA, Inc., or Yanbal, under which Yanbal purchased certain assets related to our direct-to-consumer home party business for $500,000 and assumed certain liabilities related to such assets. A more detailed description of this transaction is included in Note 12, “Discontinued Operations”, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
As a result of the divestiture of our direct-to-consumer home party business operated through our Charles & Colvard Direct, LLC (dba Lulu Avenue®) subsidiary, during the three months ended March 31, 2016, we began managing our business primarily through our two continuing distribution channels. Accordingly, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our reportable segments are our wholesale distribution channel transacted through our parent entity, and our direct-to-consumer distribution channel transacted through the wholly owned operating subsidiary, charlesandcolvard.com, LLC. We are now presenting the operating results of Charles and Colvard Direct, LLC as a discontinued operation.
 
We sell our loose moissanite jewels at wholesale to some of the largest distributors and jewelry manufacturers in the world, which mount them into fine jewelry to be sold at retail outlets and via the Internet. We also sell loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite at wholesale to retailers, TV shopping networks, and designers to be sold to end consumers and directly to consumers through our e-commerce sales channel charlesandcolvard.com and third-party marketplaces. We believe our continued and expanding use of multiple sales channels to the jewelry trade and the end consumer with branded finished jewelry featuring moissanite positions Charles & Colvard goods at the many touchpoints where consumers are when they are making their buying decisions – thereby creating greater exposure for our brand and increasing consumer demand.
 
United States, or U.S., sales represented 90% and 86% of total consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our largest customer during the year ended December 31, 2016 accounted for 23% of our total consolidated sales compared to 25% during the year ended December 31, 2015. A second customer accounted for 17% of our total consolidated sales during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 11% during the year ended December 31, 2015. No additional customers accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated sales in 2016 or 2015.
 
2016 was a pivotal year for Charles & Colvard. Acting on our vision which is driven by an ethical promise: “create the world’s most brilliant gem, while leading the way for environmentally and socially responsible choices in the jewelry industry at a revolutionary value,” we embarked on a corporate re-branding initiative designed to position our brand as a premier, consumer-facing purveyor of jewels and fine jewelry. We believe this new brand presence positions us with a platform that can support our multi-channel, global expansion strategy. Over the course of the year, we delivered key elements of our strategic plan in support of this new brand roll-out including expansion of Forever OneTM, a move up-market, expansion of our jewelry line, growth within our traditional channels, expansion of our direct-to-consumer e-commerce business and a laser focus on millennials. A more detailed description of our achievements in 2016 is included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Our go-forward strategy is one of optimization and growth. Our future success will be measured on our ability to expand existing channels while discovering new channel partners and new markets through calculated sales and marketing efforts. Our key strategies for 2017 are as follows:
 
 
· | Innovate the Forever OneTM product line. We plan to invest research and development funds and efforts into the continued expansion of the Forever OneTM offering including new jewel shapes and sizes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moissanite
 
Moissanite is a rare, naturally occurring mineral that is generally very small in size, dark green or black in color, and not a commercially viable source of gemstone material. Therefore, we expect only lab-grown SiC crystals to provide a sustainable source of moissanite for jewels.
 
In addition to carat size, important characteristics of a gemstone are beauty, durability, and rarity. The beauty of a near-colorless and colorless gemstone is characterized by its color, brilliance, and fire. The brilliance of a gemstone is measured by its refractive index, or the extent to which, when coupled with the facet design, the gemstone reflects light. The fire of a gemstone, or the breaking of light rays into spectral colors, is measured by its dispersion. Durability is determined by a gemstone’s hardness, or resistance to scratching and toughness, or resistance to chipping or cleaving. Rarity is the availability or perceived availability of a gemstone.
 
Moissanite jewels have a unique combination of brilliance, fire, durability, and rarity. Moissanite’s beauty is objectively derived from its refractive index, which is higher than other gemstones, including diamond, and its hardness is greater than all known gemstone materials except diamond. As a result, moissanite jewels, like diamond, can be cut with sharp, well-defined, and highly polished facets that accentuate their brilliance and fire. The cutting specifications (facet arrangement and proportions) for moissanite jewels are designed to maximize the brilliance and fire of the material. Additionally, we evaluate the finished jewels to exacting standards with automated video-imaging equipment and specially trained quality control personnel. Due to the rare natural occurrence of moissanite and both the proprietary and technical limitations in producing mass quantities of gem-grade moissanite, we believe that moissanite is among the rarest of jewels.
 
The following table compares the physical properties of moissanite jewels with other fine gemstone materials:
 

Description | Refractive Index | | Dispersion | | Hardness (Mohs Scale)(2) | Toughness
--------------------------------------+------------------+-----------+------------+-------+--------------------------+----------
Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® | | 2.65-2.69 | | 0.104 | | | 9.25 | Excellent 
Diamond | | 2.42 | | 0.044 | | | 10 | Excellent* 
Ruby | | 1.77 | | 0.018 | | | 9 | Excellent** 
Sapphire | | 1.77 | | 0.018 | | | 9 | Excellent** 
Emerald | | 1.58 | | 0.014 | | | 7.50 | Good to Poor

  *In cleavage direction, toughness is “good”
 **Except twinned stones

Products and Product Development
 
Moissanite jewels
 
Historically, Charles & Colvard primarily sold near-colorless moissanite jewels including Forever ClassicTM and Forever Brilliant®. We continue to offer these products in a variety of shapes including round, square brilliant, princess, cushion, radiant, pear, marquise, heart, oval, and recently Asscher, among others, in sizes ranging from approximately 1.3 to 12 millimeters (approximately 0.008 to 5.3 carats). In 2015, we announced our latest product, the first colorless moissanite jewel, Forever OneTM, which graded as D-E-F using the Gemological Institute of America’s color grading scale. Our limited launch was met with great enthusiasm from channel partners and consumers. In response to this demand, we expanded our Forever OneTM product line by offering, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the jewel in an additional color grade of G-H-I, and in more shapes and sizes.
 
Finished jewelry
 
We began selling finished jewelry featuring moissanite in 2010. Our basic designs include stud earrings, solitaire and three-stone rings, pendants, and bracelets. We are now selling an expanded selection of fashion-oriented, designer-inspired moissanite jewelry that we offer as an expansion to the basic line of jewelry. The primary ingredients of our moissanite finished jewelry are loose moissanite jewels that we have on hand as part of our finished goods inventory, white, yellow, and rose gold settings, sterling silver settings, and labor to mount the jewels into the settings.
 
In addition, we historically purchased fashion finished jewelry comprising base metals and non-precious gemstones for sale through Lulu Avenue®. This finished jewelry was fashion oriented and subject to styling trends that may change with each catalog season. The majority of this finished jewelry was custom designed for us. We made limited purchases of fashion finished jewelry after the divestiture of our direct-to-consumer home party business on March 4, 2016.
 
Source of Raw Material
 
Our moissanite jewels are made from gem-grade SiC crystals. Our sole supplier of SiC crystals is Cree, Inc., or Cree, with which we have certain exclusive supply rights for SiC crystals to be used for gemstone applications. We source the metals used for our finished jewelry, including white, yellow, and rose gold and sterling silver, from a number of manufacturers located primarily in the U.S. or internationally in China, India, Mexico, Hong Kong, or Thailand. In line with our goal of providing socially and ethically-sourced products, we require suppliers of our gold to certify that the gold is coming from conflict free sources and that all metals supplied to us are responsibly sourced.
Exclusive Supply Agreement with Cree
 
On December 12, 2014, we entered into a new exclusive supply agreement with Cree, or the Supply Agreement, which superseded and replaced our prior agreement with Cree. Under the Supply Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions, we agreed to exclusively purchase from Cree, and Cree agreed to exclusively supply, 100% of our required SiC materials in quarterly installments that must equal or exceed a set minimum order quantity. The initial term of the Supply Agreement will expire on June 24, 2018, unless extended by the parties. We also have one option to unilaterally extend the term of the agreement for an additional two-year period, subject to certain conditions. Our total purchase commitment under the Supply Agreement until June 2018 is dependent upon the size of the SiC material and ranges between approximately $29.60 million and approximately $31.50 million. As of December 31, 2016, our remaining purchase commitment through June 2018 under the Supply Agreement ranges from approximately $14.54 million to approximately $16.44 million.

On July 14, 2016, Cree announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement with Infineon Technologies AG, or Infineon, pursuant to which Infineon would purchase certain portions of Cree’s SiC materials and gemstones business. The transaction, which Cree initially indicated was expected to close by the end of calendar year 2016, contemplated that the Supply Agreement, including all rights and obligations under the Supply Agreement, would be assigned by Cree to Infineon. On February 16, 2017, Cree announced that it was terminating the asset purchase agreement because Cree and Infineon were unable to identify alternatives that would address the national security concerns raised by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Accordingly, we expect that the terminated transaction will not have any material effect on our supply of SiC materials.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We had U.S. product and method patents for moissanite jewels that expired during 2015, under which we had broad, exclusive rights to manufacture, use, and sell moissanite jewels in the U.S. We had these same patents in 25 foreign jurisdictions primarily across Asia and Europe that expired in the third quarter of 2016, and will expire in Mexico, in 2021. In addition, we have certain trademarks and pending trademark applications that support our moissanite branding strategy. We anticipate new providers of moissanite will enter the market as most of our patents have expired. We know how challenging it is to create high-quality moissanite and anticipate it will take emerging providers significant time and investment to bring meaningful and competitive products to market. As we experienced ourselves, we anticipate it will take these new providers significant time to evolve from producing low-end moissanite to delivering high-quality gemstones in the colorless or near-colorless range. Achieving the capacity to consistently produce a high-quality moissanite product at mass scale requires a careful balance of silicon carbide-specific faceting skills and a well-tuned global supply chain. Therefore, we do not anticipate direct moissanite competition in the colorless grade D-E-F or near-colorless G-H-I grade ranges for some time to come.
 
Our success and our ability to compete successfully depend in part upon our proprietary technology. In addition to our remaining international patents, we rely on trade secret laws and employee, consultant, and customer confidentiality agreements to protect certain aspects of our technology. We currently are not subject to any claims that our products or processes infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. At the present time, we are also dependent on Cree’s technology for the production of SiC crystals.
 
Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
 
Moissanite jewels
 
The production of Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® jewels is an elaborate process developed over a number of years of collaborative research and development, acquired and learned knowledge from scientists, and considerable investment expense.
 
Following are the key manufacturing processes of our moissanite jewels:
 
 
· | growing gem-grade raw SiC crystals;
--+------------------------------------


· | manufacturing rough preforms;
--+------------------------------


· | faceting jewels;
--+-----------------


· | polishing jewels; and
--+----------------------


· | inspecting, sorting, and grading.
--+----------------------------------



Growing gem-grade raw SiC crystals - SiC crystal growth suitable for gem-grade usage at commercial quantities is proprietary both in design and in operational methodology. Cree has grown the majority of our SiC crystals in accordance with the terms of the Supply Agreement. We routinely evaluate the yield and quality of saleable moissanite jewels from SiC crystals. The yield of saleable jewels from each crystal is one of the most significant factors affecting the volume and cost of moissanite jewels available for sale. Yield is dependent on the quality of the crystals, and variations in crystal quality can adversely affect our gross margin percentage.
 
Manufacturing rough preforms - We have made considerable investment in the design, development, and customization of a proprietary manufacturing process that includes equipment, software, and procedures to maximize raw material yield. The result is production of intermediary shapes, called “preforms,” that vary depending upon the size and shape of the finished jewel. We continue to invest research and development resources to improve raw material yield, including studying alternate preform shapes and cutting technologies, due to the dramatic effect such an improvement could have on our gross margin percentage.
 
 5
 

Faceting and Polishing jewels - Each preform is hand-faceted and polished by our independent third-party gem-cutters based on master designs with multiple quality control measures built into the process. Gem-cutter training is a regimented program involving several months of progressive hands-on bench training. As we continue to expand the assortment of Forever One™, we will continue the process of certifying additional cutters to ensure sufficient scalability of our production capabilities to meet anticipated demand for this new finished jewel.
 
Inspecting, sorting, and grading - Similar to other gemstones, each faceted moissanite jewel greater than 2.5 millimeters in size is individually graded against established master standards using our specially trained personnel. Additionally, as part of our overall quality assurance program, a representative sample from each batch of jewels is submitted to an image analyzer to ensure critical angles and other attributes designed to maximize moissanite’s optical properties are consistently maintained. This phase of manufacturing is relatively labor-intensive and requires skills not readily available in the general work force. In the future, we may elect to outsource certain portions of this stage of the manufacturing process to independent third parties that we will require to adhere to our rigorous quality control and monitoring standards.
 
Finished jewelry
 
Our line of finished jewelry featuring moissanite is developed by a team of industry experts integrating our moissanite jewels into many forms of jewelry, generally made of 14 karat gold and sterling silver, either designed or purchased by us utilizing a core group of suppliers, manufacturers, and finishers. In addition to our Limited Lifetime Warranty offered on our moissanite jewels, we provide a twelve-month Limited Warranty on all finished jewelry featuring moissanite.
 
Our prior line of fashion finished jewelry, comprised of base metals and non-precious gemstones for sale through Lulu Avenue®, was either designed exclusively for us and manufactured to our specifications or purchased from a core group of suppliers and manufacturers. We made limited purchases of fashion finished jewelry after the divestiture of our direct-to-consumer home party business on March 4, 2016.
 
All procured finished jewelry components are sourced from our approved suppliers, and each finished jewelry item is jobbed and/or tracked by stock keeping unit, or SKU, utilizing our enterprise resource planning system. The components of moissanite finished jewelry comprised in each job are then manufactured into finished jewelry by assemblers either in the U.S. or internationally in China, India, Mexico, Hong Kong, or Thailand. We are continuously working with our existing manufacturing partners, as well as identifying new manufacturing partners, to expand our assortments and efficiencies.
 
All finished jewelry produced by us undergoes a multi-point inspection process. A representative sampling of manufactured finished jewelry items undergoes stone and metals testing to ensure that the items for sale are of the quality that we strive to maintain. Also, in line with our goal of providing socially and ethically-sourced products, we require suppliers of our gold to certify that the gold is coming from conflict free sources and that all metals supplied to us are responsibly sourced. If required by government ordinance or requested by a customer, we facilitate the inspection of our finished jewelry by internationally recognized testing facilities to comply with legal requirements and to ensure consumer confidence.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
Marketing
 
Millennials and Social Media
 
 
· | Millennials – This important age group is socially and ethically wired. They proactively seek out goods and services that align with their core principles and become devoted and vocal advocates of brands that embody ‘green’ practices. Our socially responsible and ethically-sourced product aligns directly with the principles and purchasing requirements of the millennial and our quality and price point offer unprecedented value to the cost-conscious millennial. Throughout 2017, Charles & Colvard plans to continue proactively engaging this target market through a multi-channel traditional and digital marketing strategy.

· | Social Media – To reinforce and support our position as the premier source of moissanite, our marketing team is working on several social media initiatives that target current and future moissanite consumers and support the promotion and sale of Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite®. Our campaigns are focused on driving a consistent message emphasizing the ethical origins of our jewels, their everlasting beauty, and overall value. We are using various forms of digital and social media outreach to accomplish greater awareness of the value proposition we offer.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wholesale Distribution Segment
 
 
· | Marketing to the trade – In 2016, we continued to target the trade with print advertisements featuring our Forever Brilliant® moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring the Forever Brilliant® jewel in leading trade publications, tagging key distributors to support sales growth. Our September 2015 launch of Forever OneTM was a controlled event, and little advertising or promotion accompanied the release. We anticipate continuing to deliver meaningful promotion of Forever OneTM in 2017 as we further expand this product line and expect that we will continue to see, as we did in 2016, the wholesale distribution segment transition to Forever OneTM.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Industry associations – We maintain relationships with major jewelry industry organizations and jewelry trade publications as an opportunity to communicate with our peers on a consistent basis through media coverage, trade shows, and charitable events, among others.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Trade shows – Our attendance at leading jewelry trade shows as a sponsor, an exhibitor, or a participant has helped us extend our outreach to customers. In 2016, we attended major domestic and international jewelry industry trade shows, including JCK in Las Vegas and the Hong Kong Gem and Jewellery Fair, and we intend to continue investing in these important industry events in 2017.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cooperative advertising – Some of our loose moissanite jewels wholesale customers participate in our cooperative advertising program, which reimburses, via a credit towards future purchases, a portion of their marketing costs based on the amount of their purchases from us, subject to the customer adhering to our branding guidelines and other conditions. We plan to de-emphasize broad-based cooperative advertising, but we will consider strategic opportunities to utilize this form of advertising.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Direct-to-Consumer E-commerce Segment
 
 
· | Consumer education – Because education of the consumer is so important to sell-through of moissanite products, we continue to enhance our website www.charlesandcolvard.com to include extensive educational information about moissanite, in addition to general background information about our company. We expect to launch additional improvements and enhancements to our web presence in 2017.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Consumer advertising – We are supporting our initiative to increase consumer awareness of moissanite and our finished jewelry primarily with various forms of digital communication, including targeted email and via social media outlets.

Distribution
 
Wholesale Distribution Segment
 
We generally have contracts and agreements with our domestic and international distributor, manufacturer, and retailer wholesale customers with some variations in terms and duration.
 
 
· | Domestic - Finished jewelry featuring moissanite is sold through our wholesale distribution segment to consumers through a broad range of channels, including single- and multiple-location independent jewelry stores, jewelry store chains, online retailers, television shopping networks, department stores, and catalogs. We sell our loose moissanite jewels to wholesale distributors and finished jewelry manufacturers, which in turn set them in mountings and sell them to retailers, sell them through their own e-commerce sites, or resell the loose jewels at a markup. We also mount our loose jewels into our own jewelry, which we currently sell at wholesale to home shopping networks, various e-commerce websites, and select retailers. In addition, we have allowed loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry inventory to be placed in stores on a consignment basis. We continue to evaluate our channel strategy for domestic wholesale distribution, which may result in a change to our historical distribution methods and partners.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | International - Our international wholesale distribution currently comprises primarily loose moissanite jewels that are sold to international distributors for resale to jewelry manufacturers and retailers in their local markets. We currently have over 20 international wholesale distributors for loose moissanite jewels covering portions of Western Europe, Australia, India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. We have continued to invest in certain international markets that we believe have the most potential with respect to acceptance and sales of the moissanite jewels, including Australia, China, India, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Export sales aggregated approximately $3.00 million, or 10% of total consolidated net sales, and $3.47 million, or 14% of total consolidated net sales, in 2016 and 2015, respectively. It should be noted that a portion of our international sales consists of finished jewels sold internationally that may be re-imported to U.S. retailers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Direct-to-Consumer E-commerce Distribution Segment
 
We sell our loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite at retail through our direct-to-consumer charlesandcolvard.com, LLC e-commerce website at www.charlesandcolvard.com. We maintain on-hand stock for such basic designs as stud earrings, solitaire and three-stone rings, pendants, and bracelets and fulfill orders from our main facility. Other finished jewelry styles offered for sale on the website are made-to-order by several of our key distributors. We anticipate a continued focus and investment on site enhancement and responsiveness in order to provide our customers with a seamless shopping experience, whether the customer is shopping online from a desktop or mobile device. We believe these enhancements will drive improved customer traffic and conversion.
 
Currently, all of our direct-to-consumer e-commerce segment distribution is domestic. Sales made to international shipping addresses through our charlesandcolvard.com e-commerce website are shipped to a domestic third-party intermediary that assumes all risks and liabilities for the international transaction.
 
Direct-to-Consumer Home Parties Distribution Segment
 
Prior to the divestiture of the assets of this distribution channel, our finished fashion and moissanite jewelry offered by Lulu Avenue® was sold to consumers online at www.luluavenue.com; and in convenient, comfortable venues by our Style Advisors, using sample pieces contained in a sales kit purchased by the Style Advisor as part of the enrollment process. The Style Advisors supplemented the sample pieces with additional styles displayed in seasonal catalogs and online at www.luluavenue.com. Orders were entered by the Style Advisor into a back office system, and the products were fulfilled by a third-party logistics company that shipped the products to the Style Advisor or end consumer. All of our direct-to-consumer home party segment distribution was domestic.

Seasonality
 
Sales in the retail jewelry industry are typically seasonal due to increased consumer purchases during the holiday season. Because historically we have primarily sold our loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite at wholesale to distributors, manufacturers, and retailers, our sales to support the holiday season largely have taken place during the third and beginning of the fourth calendar quarters, depending on the sales channel and the level of advanced planning and production our customers undertook; however, the effect of seasonality on our business is also impacted by the timing of orders we receive to support new or expanded distribution and the level of current inventory position held by our customers. In recent years, excluding one-time sales events from time to time throughout the year, we have experienced a higher degree of seasonality in the fourth quarter than we have experienced in prior years primarily as a result of the holiday season sales to end consumers through our direct-to-consumer e-commerce website, charlesandcolvard.com and as a result of increased sales through televised home shopping networks within our wholesale distribution segment. In future periods, as sales of our finished jewelry increase to retailers and directly to consumers, both in dollars and as a percentage of total sales, we anticipate a seasonality trend more typical with the retail jewelry industry, and these factors may significantly affect our results of operations in a given quarter.
Working Capital Practices
 
Our primary source of working capital is cash on hand and cash generated by operations. Because we have a quarterly minimum purchase commitment under the Supply Agreement, we may be required to purchase SiC materials in excess of our immediate needs from time to time, which may result in inventories that are higher than we might otherwise maintain.
 
Our standard wholesale customer payment terms on trade receivables are generally between 30 and 90 days, though we may offer extended terms with specific customers and on significant orders from time to time. We extend credit to our customers based upon a number of factors, including an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition and credit history that is verified through trade association reference services, the customer’s payment history with us, the customer’s reputation in the trade, and/or an evaluation of the customer’s opportunity to introduce our moissanite jewels or finished jewelry featuring moissanite to new or expanded markets.
 
For our wholesale customers, our return policy allows for the return of jewels and finished jewelry for credit generally within 30 days of shipment and must be returned for a valid reason, such as quality problems or an error in shipment. For our direct-to-consumer sales channels, a customer can return purchases for any reason in accordance with our warranty policy as noted on the charlesandcolvard.com website. We have established an allowance for returns based on our historical return rate, which takes into account any contractual return privileges granted to our customers. Periodically, we ship loose jewel and finished jewelry goods to wholesale customers on consignment terms. Under these consignment terms, the customer assumes the risk of loss and has an absolute right of return for a specified period.

Moissanite jewels
 
Gemstone materials can be grouped into three types:
 
 
· | natural gemstone, which is found in nature;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | synthetic gemstone, which has the same chemical composition and essentially the same physical and optical characteristics of natural gemstone but is created in a lab; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | simulated or substitute material, which is similar in appearance to natural gemstone but does not have the same chemical composition, physical properties, or optical characteristics.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Our moissanite jewels compete with fine gemstones such as ruby, sapphire, emerald, and tanzanite as well as with natural, synthetic, and treated diamonds as a synthetic gemstone. We may also face competition from synthetic diamonds, synthetic diamond films, and other sources of synthetic moissanite not presently available in qualities, sizes, and volumes suitable for use as gemstones. Some suppliers of diamonds and other fine gemstones, as well as the suppliers of synthetic and simulated gemstones, have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, and marketing resources and greater access to distribution channels than we do.
 
We market our unique jewel as a socially-conscious and ethically-sourced, affordable, luxurious alternative to diamond at price points that make our jewel more attainable by many consumers. The diamond industry enjoys higher consumer desirability and acceptance, which has been iconicized by the “Diamonds are Forever” marketing campaign. Historical efforts to differentiate moissanite from diamond as a unique jewel by virtue of its distinctive composition and its superior optical characteristics were a challenge, as moissanite resembles diamond in the eyes of consumers. Therefore, our 2016 marketing effort was to educate our target market on the social and ethical distinctions of our unique gemstones.
 
The worldwide market for large, uncut, high-quality natural diamonds is significantly consolidated and controlled by DeBeers (headquartered in South Africa), Alrosa (Russia), Rio Tinto (Australia), and BHP (Canada). These companies have a major impact on the worldwide supply and pricing of natural diamonds at both the wholesale and retail levels. Diamond producers may undertake additional marketing or other activities designed to protect the diamond jewelry market against sales erosion from consumer acceptance of moissanite jewels.
 
We may also face competition from treated and synthetic diamonds. Treated diamonds, which are natural diamonds with imperfections or flaws that have been altered in some manner to enhance their appearance, have been available in the jewelry industry for the past several decades and are generally less expensive than diamonds of similar size, cut, and color that have not been altered. Synthetic diamonds are also available in the marketplace and are produced for jewelry applications available to consumers. We have seen a recent emergence of new manufacturers of lab-grown diamonds that offer a product directly competitive with natural diamond; however, they are priced just below that of natural diamond, and therefore compete with Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® at a much higher price point. Although we believe that colorless gemstone-quality synthetic and treated diamonds presently cannot be produced at prices competitive with those currently offered for our moissanite jewels, there can be no assurance that such competitive prices cannot be achieved in the future by the producers of either or both synthetic and treated diamonds. The primary producers of synthetic diamonds used for industrial applications are DeBeers and Sumitomo. There are also a number of Russian producers of synthetic diamonds for industrial uses. In addition, companies such as Chatham, Diamond Foundry, and Scio Diamond Technology Corporation are synthesizing diamonds in limited quantities, limited carat sizes, and in limited ranges of color. Synthetic diamond films can be grown at commercially viable prices in thicknesses that can be applied to various surfaces such as other synthetic materials.
 
The global diamond market is in excess of $80 billion in annual sales. Assuming 10% of the global diamond jewelry market is interested in lab-grown and alternative diamond stones, then the addressable market is $8 billion, with US and China making up over half of the market opportunity. As lab-grown diamonds continue to garner attention and raise awareness for alternatives to mined diamonds, but are relatively expensive, we believe our unique moissanite jewels have a great opportunity in this market.

Although we believe that our moissanite jewels have a proprietary position, we could face competition from other companies that develop competing SiC technologies. Some of these technologies could be developed by producers of SiC used for other industrial applications. Manufacturers of industrial SiC products include The Carborundum Corporation (currently for abrasive uses); and Cree, Siemens AG, Norstel, Bridgestone, ABB, Dow Chemical, SiC Crystal AG, and Northrop Grumman Corporation (currently for semiconductor uses). We believe that Cree is currently the only supplier of SiC crystals in colors, sizes, and volumes that are suitable for gemstone applications. It is possible, however, that these or other producers of SiC could develop SiC crystals suitable for gemstone applications and produce moissanite jewels unless we could obtain judicial enforcement of our remaining patent rights. It is also possible that such competition could emerge in geographic territories where we do not currently have patent protection. However, we know how challenging it is to create high-quality moissanite and anticipate it will take emerging providers significant time and investment to bring meaningful and competitive products to market. As we experienced ourselves, we anticipate it will take these new providers significant time to evolve from producing low-end moissanite to delivering high-quality gemstones in the colorless or near-colorless range. Achieving the capacity to consistently produce a high-quality moissanite product at mass scale requires a careful balance of silicon carbide-specific faceting skills and a well-tuned global supply chain. Therefore, we do not anticipate direct moissanite competition in the colorless grade D-E-F or near-colorless G-H-I grade ranges for some time to come.
 
We may also, to a lesser degree, face competition from existing diamond simulants and other synthetic gemstones, including cubic zirconia. Producers and sellers of these products may see the markets for these products being eroded by the market penetration of our moissanite jewels. We believe that the substantially lower price of these products is the primary basis upon which they will compete with our moissanite jewels; however, they are not considered fine jewelry products.
 
Finished jewelry
 
The global fine jewelry market competition is fierce. Such well-known jewelry designers and manufacturers as David Yurman, Tacori, Harry Winston, Tiffany & Co., and Pandora, among others, have a variety of jewelry collections featuring diamond and other precious and semi-precious gemstones, and enjoy strong brand recognition and a loyal consumer following. These companies also have greater financial resources than we do to develop and market their products.
 
We intend to expand our market share and compete with these well-known brands primarily on the basis of the combination of quality, design, and value, as moissanite is the highest quality, affordable alternative available to more expensive gemstones such as diamond. We believe that focusing on the clear advantages in its retail price points, especially in the one-carat and larger sizes, will provide a key point of differentiation and value proposition to the end consumer who may not have had the opportunity to previously purchase fine jewelry due to limitations in discretionary spending income.
 
In addition, we believe that the Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® brand, in addition to other brands for both the moissanite jewels, including Forever OneTM, and moissanite finished jewelry that we are developing pursuant to our marketing programs, may create a long-term competitive advantage for our products as we build brand recognition. We endeavor to partner with recognized designers and jewelry companies, in addition to developing our own proprietary brands of finished jewelry. While our finished jewelry business is still developing, our goal is to build multiple strong brands sought after by the end consumer. We propose to focus our marketing efforts on emphasizing our attractive designs, coupled with moissanite’s exceptional brilliance, fire, durability, and rarity, to establish moissanite as a primary consumer choice in fine jewelry.
 
Our design, manufacture and marketing of finished jewelry featuring moissanite under exclusive brands for sale at wholesale to distributors and retailers and at retail to end consumers through our charlesandcolvard.com e-commerce sales channel may result in some of our current wholesale customers perceiving us as a competitor, despite our efforts to use primarily non-conflicting sales channels. As we continue to develop our finished jewelry business, we intend to increase distribution through new and existing channels similarly to how many other companies have executed cross-channel marketing and distribution strategies. Due to the size of the finished jewelry market, we believe that such sales channels can co-exist, with the overall end result being increased consumer and brand awareness of moissanite products and a corresponding increased demand for not only our products, but those of our distributor and manufacturer customers as well.

Government Regulation
 
We are subject to governmental regulations in the manufacture and sale of moissanite jewels and finished jewelry. In particular, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has issued regulations and guidelines governing the marketing of synthetic gemstones and other gemstones similar to diamond that require such gemstones to be clearly identified in any promotional or marketing materials. In addition, the precious metal in our finished jewelry may be subject to requirements, which vary by country and by state, such as hallmarking and alloy content. While we have a policy to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, if our actions are found to be in violation of FTC or other governmental regulations, we may be required to suspend marketing of our products and could incur significant expenses in developing new marketing strategies and materials that would not violate FTC regulations.
Research and Development
 
We invested approximately $2,900 in research and development during 2016 compared to $18,000 in 2015 primarily for the study of product enhancement and manufacturing process efficiencies.
 
Employees
 
As of March 6, 2017, we had a total of 69 employees, 65 of which were full-time and four of which were part-time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that our employee relations are good.
