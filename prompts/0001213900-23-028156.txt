Item 1. Business
Company History and Certain Recent Developments



We were incorporated, in Delaware, as Pensare Acquisition Corp, a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) on April 7, 2016 for the purpose of entering into one or more mergers, share exchanges, asset acquisitions, stock purchases, recapitalizations, reorganizations or other similar business combinations with one or more target businesses.



On April 7, 2020 (the “Computex Closing Date”), we consummated a business combination transaction (the “Computex Business Combination”) in which we acquired Stratos Management Systems, Inc. (“Computex”), a private operating company that does business as Computex Technology Solutions. In connection with the closing of the Computex Business Combination, the Company changed its name to American Virtual Cloud Technologies, Inc.



On December 1, 2020 (the “Kandy Closing Date”), we acquired the Kandy Communications business (hereafter referred to as “Kandy” or “Kandy Communications”) from Ribbon Communications, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (“Ribbon”), by acquiring certain assets, assuming certain liabilities and acquiring all of the outstanding membership interests of Kandy Communications LLC.



On September 16, 2021, the Company announced that as a result of a decision by the Company’s Board of Directors to explore strategic alternatives previously announced on April 7, 2021, the Board had authorized the Company to focus its strategy on acquisitions and organic growth in its cloud technologies business as well as to explore strategic opportunities for its IT solutions business, including the divestiture of Computex. The Company believed that such changes would have allowed it to optimize resource allocation, focus on core competencies, and improve its ability to invest in areas of maximal growth potential.



On January 27, 2022, the Company announced that it had executed a definitive agreement to sell Computex, and on March 15, 2022, the sale of Computex was consummated, which completed the Company’s transition to a cloud communications company, centered on its Kandy platform. In connection with the then pending sale of Computex, Computex was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2021 and its operations were separated and classified as discontinued operations. The discussions in this Form 10-K primarily focuses on the Company’s corporate activities and its Kandy segment. Net proceeds from the sale of Computex, after payment of closing and certain other obligations were used for working capital and general business purposes.



On August 25, 2022, the Company announced that it had retained Northland Capital Markets to advise the Company in connection with a comprehensive strategic review process that could lead to the sale of the Company or of selected assets.



During 2022, the Company continued to explore strategic opportunities, including the rationalization of resource allocation and core competencies. Further, the Company took actions that it believed resulted in significant cost savings. Such savings were generated from selective reductions in workforce and negotiated conversions of certain material vendor support costs from fixed to variable, thereby eliminating certain cost burdens related to unused capacity. In addition, the Company obtained strategic and operating restructuring support services of certain capital advisors.



Additionally, during 2022, the Company projected and announced that it would need additional capital to fund its operations including research & development and capital investment requirements until the Company scaled to a revenue level that would permit cash self-sufficiency. Such factors raised substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The projection was based on the Company’s forecasts regarding product sales and service, cost structure, cash burn rate and other operating assumptions.



On January 11, 2023, the Debtors filed the Cases as voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 in the Court. The respective Case numbers for each of the Debtors are 23-10020, 23-10021 and 23-10022. However, the Cases are being jointly administered under Case number 23-10020. The Debtors are continuing to operate their businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the US Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Court. To ensure their ability to continue operating in the ordinary course of business, the Debtors filed various “first day” motions with the Court requesting customary relief, including the authority to pay employee wages and benefits, that have enabled the Debtors to continue to operate their business during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings without material disruption to their ordinary course operations.

On February 14, 2023, the Sellers entered into the Stalking Horse APA with the Purchaser, and in connection with the Cases, and pursuant to bid procedures approved by the Court, on March 7, 2023, the Debtors held the Auction under Section 363 of the US Bankruptcy Code relating to the disposition of substantially all of the Debtors’ assets. The winning bid at the Auction was submitted by the Purchaser, who agreed to pay cash consideration of approximately $6.8 million.



On March 10, 2023, the Sellers and the Purchaser executed the Purchase Agreement, which is substantially the same as the Stalking Horse APA, except that it reflects the cash purchase price of approximately $6.8 million resulting from the Auction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser agreed to purchase the Purchased Assets, consisting of substantially all of the assets of the Sellers. The Purchased Assets include, among other things, all rights of the Sellers under the Assumed Contracts and Assumed Leases that are defined in the Purchase Agreement, tangible personal property, intellectual property rights, books and records and any goodwill, but excludes cash, accounts receivable and certain other assets. Under the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser is expected to acquire the Purchased Assets for a purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) consisting of (i) cash of approximately $6.8 million, subject to certain adjustments (including a reduction by the amount, if any, by which the deferred revenues of the Sellers as of the date of the closing of the Purchase Agreement exceeds the deferred revenues of the Sellers as of the date of the Purchase Agreement), and (ii) the Purchaser’s assumption of certain liabilities of the Sellers.



On March 15, 2023, the Court entered an order authorizing the Asset Sale pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. On March 24, 2023, the Asset Sale closed, thereby completing the disposition of substantially all of the Company’s assets. As identified in the Debtors’ Combined Disclosure Statement and Chapter 11 Plan of Liquidation (the “Plan”), filed with the Court on March 21, 2023, and subject to Court approval, the Company anticipates that there will be no proceeds available for distribution to the Company’s stockholders and that the Company’s outstanding securities shall be cancelled upon confirmation of the Plan.  Nothing herein is intended to act as a solicitation of the Plan.



Reverse Stock Split and Stock Exchange



On September 30, 2022, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Certificate of Amendment”), which effected, upon filing on September 30, 2022 (the “Effective Stock Split Date”), a one-for-fifteen reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, the CUSIP number (Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures number) for the Company’s common stock changed.



As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each share of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Stock Split Date was automatically reclassified as and converted into one-fifteenth (1/15) of a share of the Company’s common stock. The Reverse Stock Split affected all stockholders uniformly and did not alter any stockholder’s percentage interest in the Company’s equity, except to the extent that the Reverse Stock Split resulted in some stockholders owning a fractional share. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, stockholders who would otherwise have been entitled to fractional shares of the Company’s common stock became entitled to receive cash payments in lieu of such fractional shares.



On January 25, 2023, the Company’s securities ceased trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) as the Company did not meet the requirements for continued trading thereon. Currently, the Company’s securities trade on the Pink sheets, an over-the-counter (OTC) market.



The Business



The description of the Company’s business contained herein reflects the Company’s operation of its business prior to the completion of the Asset Sale on March 24, 2023. As a result of the Asset Sale, the Company no longer has any operations, other than those relating to the wind down of its business and completion of the Chapter 11 process.



The Kandy cloud communications platform is a cloud-based, real-time communications platform, offering proprietary unified communications as a service (“UCaaS”), communications platform as a service (“CPaaS”), Microsoft Teams Direct Routing as a Service (“DRaaS”), and SIP Trunking as a Service capabilities (“STaaS”).



As a provider of cloud-based enterprise services, Kandy deploys a global carrier grade cloud communications platform that supports the digital and cloud transformation of mid-market and enterprise customers across virtually any device, on virtually any network, in virtually any location. The Kandy platform is based on a powerful, proprietary multi-tenant, highly scalable, and secure cloud platform. Further, Kandy supports rapid service creation and multiple go to market models including white labelling, multi-tier channel distribution, enterprise direct, and self-service via its SaaS (software as a service) web portals.

Kandy’s cloud-based, real-time communications platform enables service providers, enterprises, software vendors, systems integrators, partners and developers to enrich their applications and their services with real-time contextual communications empowering the API (Application Programming Interface) economy. With Kandy’s platform, companies of various sizes and types can quickly embed real-time communications capabilities into their existing applications and business processes, thereby providing a more engaging user experience.



While the cloud communications business is focused on highly complex, medium and large enterprise deployments, the customer experience is augmented by our managed services capabilities. In addition, our strategic partnerships with companies such as AT&T, IBM/Kyndryl, and Etisalat, give us access to a marquee customer base and the ability to sell end-to-end solutions.



Computex, sold in March 2022 and classified within discontinued operations, is a leading multi-brand technology solutions provider to large global customers, providing a comprehensive and integrated set of technology solutions, through its extensive hardware, software and value-added service offerings.



Major customers



Kandy only



The five top customers during Fiscal 2022 accounted for 79% of total Kandy revenues. Four customers accounted for more than 10% of total revenue, accounting for $11.8 million of total Kandy revenue.



Competition



Kandy primarily competes with technology and cloud providers such as 8X8, RingCentral, Vonage, Twilio, Nice and Five 9, among others. However, Kandy differentiates itself from its competitors largely by the nature of its route to market - its platform is a proprietary white label, global cloud platform that supports a single or a multi-tier distribution via a CSP (communications service provider), VAR (value-added reseller) or ISV (independent software vendor) brand.  Further, in addition to being a true multi-tenant platform, Kandy supports a BYOD (bring your own data) and BYOC (bring your own carrier) model while providing both a light weight and heavy weight OSS/BSS (Ordering/Billing) system and automation integration with its channel partners.  Lastly, the Kandy platform brings a ubiquitous experience across UCaaS, CCaaS, and CPaaS versus most of the competition who play in one or two of these communications market verticals.
International Operations and Segments



During 2021, the Company operated two segments, Computex and Kandy. With the sale of Computex during the first quarter of 2022, the Company began operating as one reportable segment beginning in the second quarter of 2022. At December 31, 2022, approximately 70 associates were employed in our international operations.
Research and Development



Through Kandy, we have incurred software development costs to enhance, improve, expand and/or upgrade our proprietary software in an agile software environment with releases broken down into several iterations called sprints. These development activities have been performed by internal staff as well as by certain contractors.



Through our Kandy R&D team, our research and development efforts have been focused, in part, on building a carrier-grade communications platform with a focus on next generation software technologies and frictionless communications with multiple go-to-market strategies, including channel and direct sales models.



As of December 31, 2022, our research and development team consisted of approximately 31 associates (excluding contractors).

Sales and Marketing



We have been targeting customers of varying sizes in both the private and public sector and have developed relationships with them through direct marketing efforts as well as through strategic relationships with our technology partners.



We acquire new account relationships through face-to-face field sales, through relationships with our partners and through targeted direct marketing efforts that aim to increase awareness of our solutions.



Our sales representatives are generally compensated through a combination of fixed and variable compensation. Variable compensation or commission becomes the primary basis of compensation as sales representatives gain more experience.



Proprietary Rights 



We have relied on a combination of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and contractual provisions to protect the proprietary rights of our products, processes and technology. In addition, we have, at times, entered into confidentiality and assignment-of-rights agreements with our employees, consultants and customers and have limited access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. We licensed our proprietary products to our customers under license agreements that we believe contain appropriate use and other restrictions. However, despite our efforts to safeguard our proprietary rights, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully deter misappropriation or unauthorized third-party use of such rights. As is the case with any software company, safeguarding unauthorized use of our software is difficult, and piracy could become a problem. In addition, if we are engaged in transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or are not well enforced, our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be effective. Enforcing our proprietary rights in the U.S. and abroad and any litigation to enforce such rights, can result in significant costs and can divert resources, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.



As the number of solutions available in the marketplace increases and solution functionality continues to overlap, software companies may increasingly become subject to claims of infringement or other misappropriation of intellectual property. Third parties may assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us relating to our software, processes or technology. Following up such claims, whether or not they have merit, can be time-consuming and can result in costly litigation, cause delays in our business or have other negative consequences. Defending such claims, entering into royalty or licensing agreements, or adverse determinations in proprietary rights litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.



COVID-19



COVID-19 continues to impact local, regional, and global economies, businesses, supply chains, production and sales across a range of industries.



To protect the health and safety of our employees, our daily execution evolved into a largely virtual model. However, we found ways to continue to engage with and assist our customers and partners as they worked to navigate the changed environment.

Our core values – Integrity, innovation, delighting our clients, diversity and teamwork are communicated to our employees upon joining our company.

On December 31, 2022, our employee base stood at approximately 127 employees worldwide, of which more than 55% were employed in our international operations. We have offices in Canada, Mexico, and the United States, as well as representatives in the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. None of our employees are represented by unions and we consider the relationships with our employees to be good. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 26.7% of our workforce. Due in large part to a scaling back in the Company’s operations during Fiscal 2022, the attrition rate in Fiscal 2022 was 44.6%.



As of December 31, 2022, the composition of our employee base was as follows:




 | Corporate | | Kandy | | Total
--------------------------+-----------+---+-------+-----+------
Sales and marketing | | - | | 17 | | 17 
Product support and R&D | | - | | 94 | | 94 
Admin | | 6 | | 10 | | 16 
Total number of employees | | 6 | | 121 | | 127
