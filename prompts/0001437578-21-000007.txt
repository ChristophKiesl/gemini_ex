Item 1. Business
Our Company
For over 30 years, Bright Horizons has been a champion for working families — designing and delivering innovative education and care solutions. We are a leading provider of high-quality child care and early education, dependent care, and workforce education services that are designed to help client employees better integrate work and family life, as well as grow their careers. We provide services primarily under multi-year contracts with employers who offer child care and early education, back-up care and educational advisory and other services as part of their employee benefits packages in an effort to support employees across life and career stages and to improve recruitment, employee engagement, productivity, retention, and career advancement.
We are organized into three reportable segments, which are aligned with our service offerings as follows:
•full-service center-based child care (approximately 68% and 82% of our revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively);
•back-up care (approximately 26% and 14% of our revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively); and
•educational advisory and other services (approximately 6% and 4% of our revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively).
As of December 31, 2020, we had more than 1,300 client relationships with employers across a diverse array of industries, including more than 190 Fortune 500 companies and more than 80 of Working Mother magazine’s 2020 “100 Best Companies.” As of December 31, 2020, we operated a total of 1,014 child care and early education centers with the capacity to serve approximately 114,000 children and their families in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and India.
Our History
Guided by our HEART principles — Honesty, Excellence, Accountability, Respect, Teamwork — we have operated child care and early education centers for employers and working parents since 1986. In 1998, we transformed our organization through the merger of Bright Horizons, Inc. and Corporate Family Solutions, Inc., both then Nasdaq-listed companies that were founded in 1986 and 1987, respectively. We were listed on Nasdaq from 1998 to May 2008 when we were acquired by investment funds affiliated with Bain Capital Partners LLC (referred to as our “going private transaction”). On January 30, 2013, we completed our initial public offering and our common stock became listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “BFAM.”
Throughout our history, we have continued to grow while investing in our future. We have extended our international footprint to become a leading provider in the center-based child care market in the United Kingdom and have expanded into the Netherlands, and India as a platform for further international expansion. In the United States, we have grown our partnerships with employer clients by expanding and enhancing our back-up care services and by developing and growing our educational advisory services. We continue to invest in new technologies to better support our full suite of services as well as enhance our customers’ user experience, and we have increased our digital marketing efforts with additional focus on driving use of our services and maximizing enrollment in centers.
COVID-19 Pandemic
Since March 2020, the world has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and our global operations have been substantially disrupted. Our full-service center-based child care segment has experienced the most disruption due to business and school closures, stay-at-home and lockdown orders, and reduced capacities and lower enrollment for much of the year. In mid-March 2020, in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, we temporarily closed a significant portion of our child care centers, while we continued to operate critical health care client and “hub” centers to provide care and support services to the children whose parents worked on the front lines of the response. As countries and local jurisdictions lifted certain restrictions, we re-opened our temporarily closed centers and, as of December 31, 2020, 910 of our 1,014 child care centers were open. Our centers are operating with stringent COVID-19 protocols in order to protect the health and safety of children, families and staff, including social distancing procedures for pick-up and drop-off, daily health screenings, the use of face masks by our staff, limited group sizes, and enhanced hygiene and cleaning practices. We are focused on the re-enrollment and ramping of these centers, while also continuing the phased re-opening of the limited number of centers that remain temporarily closed. As this is a continuously changing environment, we cannot anticipate how long it will take for re-opened centers to reach typical enrollment levels and there is no assurance that centers currently open will continue to operate.

Our back-up care and educational advisory and other services have remained fully operational to clients and their employees. During the COVID-19 pandemic we have experienced increased demand for certain back-up care service offerings, such as in-home care and self-sourced reimbursed care, and more limited disruption to our educational advisory and other services, but these conditions and trends may not continue in subsequent periods. As businesses and families have adapted to changing conditions, we have seen our back-up care services shift towards the more traditional in-center and in-home delivery of back-up care solutions.
The broad effects of COVID-19, its duration, scope of the ongoing disruption, and impact on our financial and operating results cannot be predicted and is affected by many interdependent variables and decisions by government authorities and our client partners, as well as economic trends, the adoption and effectiveness of a vaccine, and developments in the persistence and treatment of COVID-19. Given these factors, we expect the effects of COVID-19 on our business to continue to adversely impact our results of operations in 2021.
Industry Overview and Trends
We compete in the global market for child care and early education services as well as the market for workforce education services offered by clients as benefits to their employees.
The child care industry generally can be divided into center-based and home-based child care. Our full-service segment operates in the center-based market, which is highly fragmented. The center-based child care market includes both retail and employer-sponsored centers. The employer-sponsored model has always been central to our business and is characterized by a single employer or consortium of employers entering into a long-term contract for the provision of child care at a center located at or near the employer sponsor’s worksite.
Additionally, we operate in the growing markets for back-up care, which consist of center-based back-up care, in-home care, and self-sourced reimbursed care, and educational advisory services, which consist of workforce education, tuition assistance, student loan repayment and related educational advising, as well as college admissions and college financial advisory services. We believe we are one of the largest and highest quality providers of back-up care and educational advisory services.
We believe that the following key factors contribute to growth in the markets for employer-sponsored child care, back-up care, and educational advisory services.
Increasing Participation of Working Parents in the Workforce
A significant percentage of parents currently participate in the workforce, making child care services and family supports critical to the overall health of the economy. While the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the U.S. workforce by temporarily reducing the number of working parents, particularly working women, and shifting from traditional office environments to working in “virtual” or “home” offices, we believe employment rates and participation levels will return to pre-COVID levels in the future and the demand for child care supports for working parents will likewise increase. In 2019, prior to the pandemic, women working full time comprised approximately 50% of the workforce in the U.S., and over 60% of two-parent households were dual career earners. Additionally, 64% of mothers with children under the age of 6 participated in the workforce in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Despite the temporary workforce demographic shifts because of COVID-19, we believe that the number of working mothers, single and dual working parent families will continue to increase over time, resulting in an increase in the need for child and dependent care, as well as other workplace solutions that support employees at each life and career stage.
Greater Demand for High-Quality Center-Based Child Care and Early Education
We believe that recognition of the importance of early education and consistent quality child care has led to increased demand for higher-quality center-based education and care. With the expansion of center-based care, there is continued focus on the establishment of objective, standards-based methods of defining and measuring the quality of child care, such as accreditation. Additionally, we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has increased parent focus and awareness of the health and safety practices of center-based and in-home care providers, as well as the need for social and other development opportunities for children in child care or school settings. We believe robust health and safety protocols and the social, educational and other developmental opportunities presented by center-based care are important factors for families when determining whether to send their children to center-based care. Additionally, recent increases in the number of employees working remotely or from home have further highlighted the need for care and family supports irrespective of work location. In a highly fragmented market comprised largely of center operators lacking scale, we believe clients and families will favor larger industry participants with the size and capital resources to achieve high quality standards on a consistent basis.

Recognized Return on Investment to Employers
Studies conducted through our workforce consulting practice indicate that employer sponsors of center-based child care and back-up care services realize strong returns on their investments in terms of reduced turnover and increased productivity. We estimate that users of our back-up care services have been able to work, on average, an additional six days annually that they otherwise would have missed due to breakdowns in child care arrangements. Additionally, according to a 2019 survey of our clients, 98% of respondents reported that access to back-up care helps their employees be more productive and a significant majority of surveyed parents with children in a child care center or school setting feel their arrangement allows them to focus on their work. In particular, our ability to continue to deliver a variety of child care support services and solutions to meet the needs of children and families during the pandemic vividly demonstrated the value and importance of our services to our client partners, including the role our services played in ensuring those partners could continue to deliver on their own business priorities. We believe that this return on investment for employers, demonstrated across our suite of solutions, will result in additional growth in employer-sponsored center-based child care, back-up care and educational advisory services.
Growing Global Demand for Child Care and Early Education Services
We expect that the shift to service-based economies and an increasing emphasis on the importance of early education and child care by government and families will contribute to further growth in the global child care and early education market as well as the developing markets for back-up care and educational advisory services. In addition, continued governmental efforts to make child care more affordable for working families, and thereby encouraging parents to return and remain in the workforce, have led and may lead to additional or increased child care subsidies in certain geographies increasing demand for child care and early education.
Evolving Workforce
We believe there is a focus on recruitment and retention by employers, as well as the continued education and training of the existing workforce, due to the evolution and introduction of new technologies, as well as increased competition for talent. We believe that the modern worker values efforts by employers to support employees across life and career stages that help them thrive in the workplace. As automation, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other advances transform nearly every facet of the labor market, there is an increased need for continued education and up-skilling of the existing workforce. We believe these growing needs and changing trends, coupled with increased competition for talent, will encourage employers to invest in solutions and supports that enable workers to realize their full professional potential, including investments in center-based early education and child care, back-up care and educational advisory services as a means to elevate their brand and bolster employee engagement, recruitment, and retention.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Fiscal 2020 saw an increased emphasis by employers on diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, we are in the unique position of educating the next generation, and with that responsibility comes the opportunity to make a difference by modeling for children and families an environment that is open, curious, and genuinely interested in what is different. We are also exploring with clients how our services support their diversity, equity and inclusion objectives, particularly in workforce education. We believe that our workforce education offerings, along with back-up care and early education, can be a vital element of an employer’s diversity, equity and inclusion strategy. Our services not only help employers attract and retain employees from different backgrounds, but more importantly, can also help to propel the career growth and development of these employees.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we are a provider, partner and employer of choice because of our dedication to providing high quality solutions to those we serve.
Market Leading Service Provider
We believe we are a leader in employer-sponsored center-based child care, back-up care, and educational advisory services, and that the breadth, depth and quality of our service offerings — developed over a successful 30-year history — represent significant competitive advantages. We estimate that we have approximately six times more employer-sponsored centers in the United States than our closest competitor, according to data obtained from the Child Care Information Exchange’s 2019 Employer Child Care Trend Report on center-based providers. We believe the broad geographic reach of our child care centers and workplace solutions, with targeted clusters of centers in areas where we believe demand is generally higher and where income demographics are attractive, provides us with a competitive platform to market our suite of services to new and existing clients.

Collaborative, Long-Term Relationships with Diverse Customer Base
We have more than 1,300 client relationships with employers across a diverse array of industries, including more than 190 of the Fortune 500 companies, with our largest client contributing 2% of our revenue in fiscal 2020 and our largest 10 clients representing approximately 10% of our revenue in the same year. Our business model emphasizes multi-year employer sponsorship contracts where our clients typically fund the development of new child care centers (which is typically owned or leased by the sponsor) at or near their worksites and frequently support the ongoing operations of these centers.
Our multiple service points with both employers and employees give us unique insight into the corporate culture of our clients and enables us to identify and provide innovative and tailored solutions to address our clients’ specific needs. In addition to full-service center-based child care, we provide access to a multi-national back-up care network and educational advisory support, allowing us to offer various combinations of services and solutions to best meet the needs of specific clients or specific locations for a single client across geographies and life and career stages. We believe our tailored, collaborative approach to employer-sponsored dependent care and educational advising has contributed to an annual client retention rate of approximately 95% for employer-sponsored centers over the past ten years and has allowed us to cross-sell and expand our service offerings to existing clients.
Our business is anchored in our commitment to consistently provide high-quality service offerings to employers and families. We have designed our child care centers to meet or exceed applicable accreditation and rating standards in all of our key markets, including standards set in the United States by the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs, a division of the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), and in the United Kingdom by the Office of Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (OFSTED). We believe our commitment to achieving accreditation standards offers a competitive advantage in securing employer sponsorship opportunities and in attracting and retaining families as an increasing number of potential and existing employer clients require or expect adherence to accreditation criteria.
Our proprietary curriculum and educational practices are informed by the science of early learning and research on childhood development. Our resources and training programs guide teachers as they transform this research into practice through high-quality learning experiences and evidence-based instructional practices. We also believe that low adult-to-child ratios and small group sizes are critical factors in delivering our curriculum effectively as well as helping to facilitate more personalized care. Our programs provide adult-to-child ratios and group sizes that meet or exceed licensing standards.
Dedicated to the highest quality services in every category in which we operate, our standards of quality also extend to our back-up care and educational advisory services, whether care is delivered in Bright Horizons child care centers, through the quality child care centers and in-home care providers participating in our proprietary back-up care network, or advising provided by our team of education experts. In addition to our annual client retention rate of approximately 95%, we have consistently achieved satisfaction ratings of approximately 98% among respondents in our employer and parent satisfaction surveys, which is a testament to our dedication to quality.
Market Leading People Practices
Our ability to deliver consistently high-quality care, education and other services is directly related to our ability to attract, retain, motivate and develop our skilled workforce. We have consistently been named as a top employer by third-party sources in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, including being named as one of the “100 Best Companies to Work For” by Fortune Magazine 19 times, as well as a great place to work in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands by the Great Place to Work Institute. We have also been named one of the “Top Places to Work” by the Boston Globe 12 times and the Denver Post seven times.
We believe the education and experience of our center leaders and teachers exceed the industry average. In addition to ongoing in-center training, we have an in-house online training university that allows our employees to earn nationally-recognized child development credentials. Additionally, our Horizons Teacher Degree Program provides our early educators the ability to earn an associate or bachelor’s degree in early childhood education completely paid for by Bright Horizons with no out-of-pocket expenses to the employee. We believe this program is unique in our industry, and will continue to distinguish us as an employer of choice while helping to retain and incentivize teachers to grow their careers at Bright Horizons.
Capital Efficient Operating Model Provides Platform for Growth with Attractive Economics
We have a long history of proven financial results despite broader macro-economic fluctuations. With employer sponsors funding the majority of the capital required for new centers developed on their behalf, we have been able to grow our business with limited capital investment, which has contributed to strong cash flows from operations.

Proven Acquisition Track Record
We have an established acquisition team to pursue potential targets using a proven framework to effectively evaluate potential transactions with the goal of maximizing our return on investment while minimizing risk. Over the last ten years, we have completed the acquisition of more than 400 child care centers in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as providers of back-up care services and educational advisory and other services in the United States and the United Kingdom, helping us expand our client base, enhance the scope and reach of our service offerings, broaden our technological capabilities, and offer new services. In 2020, we acquired two child care centers and the Sittercity business, an online marketplace for families and caregivers, in the United States.
Our Growth Strategy
We believe that there are significant opportunities to continue to grow our business globally by continuing to execute on the following strategies.
Grow Our Client Relationships
•Secure Relationships with New Employer Clients.  Our addressable market includes approximately 13,000 employers, each with at least 1,000 employees, within the industries that we currently serve in the United States and the United Kingdom. Our dedicated sales team focuses on establishing new client relationships and is supported by our workforce consulting practice, which helps potential clients identify the precise offerings that will best meet their strategic goals.
•Cross-Sell and Expand Services to Existing Employer Clients.  We believe there is a significant opportunity to increase the number of our clients that use more than one of our services, and to expand the services we provide to existing clients. Since 2013, we have more than doubled the number of our clients who utilize more than one of our services to more than 360 clients as of December 31, 2020.
•Continue to Expand Through the Assumption of Management of Existing Sponsored Child Care Centers.  At times we assume the management of existing centers from the incumbent management, which enables us to develop new client relationships, typically with no capital investment and no purchase price payment.
Enable Continued Investments in Quality
We look for opportunities to invest in quality as a way to enhance our reputation with our clients and their employees, and the families we serve, such as enhanced curriculum and enrichment activities.  By developing a strong reputation for high-quality services and facilities, we have been able to support price increases that have kept pace with our cost increases.
Increase Utilization at Existing Centers and Use of Back-up Care and Educational Advisory Services
We are continually looking to increase enrollment levels and utilization in our more recently opened profit and loss centers, as well as our mature profit and loss centers (centers that have been open for more than three years, as more fully described below) in order to achieve continued growth and improved center economics. We also look for opportunities to increase the use of our back-up care and educational advisory services, not only by growing client relationships, but also by driving use at existing clients. We continue to invest in new technologies to better support our full suite of services and to enhance our customers’ user experience to help drive utilization. We have expanded our marketing efforts with additional focus on driving awareness of and use of our services, with a focus on maximizing occupancy levels in centers where we can improve our economics with increased enrollment.
Selectively Add New Lease/Consortium Centers and Expand Through Acquisitions
We have typically added between 10 and 15 new lease/consortium centers (as more fully described below) annually for the past five years, focusing on urban or city surrounding markets where demand is generally higher and where income demographics are generally more supportive of our high quality centers. In addition, we have a long track record of successfully completing and integrating selective acquisitions across all business lines. The domestic and international markets for child care and other work and family support services remain highly fragmented and we will continue to seek attractive opportunities both for center acquisitions and the acquisition of complementary service offerings.

Our Operations
Our services are designed to help families, employers, and their employees solve the challenges of the modern workforce across all life and career stages. Our services are comprised of full-service center-based child care, back-up care, and educational advisory and other services, which are also our reportable segments. Full-service center-based child care includes traditional center-based child care and early education, preschool and elementary education. Back-up care includes center-based back-up child care, in-home care for children and adult/elder dependents, and self-sourced reimbursed care. Educational advisory and other services consist of tuition assistance and student loan repayment program administration, workforce education, related educational advising, college admissions advisory services, as well as an online marketplace for families and caregivers. The following table sets forth our segment results for the year ended December 31, 2020:

 | Full-servicecenter-based child care | | Back-up care | | Educationaladvisory and other services | | Total

Additional segment information is included in Note 17, Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Full-Service Center-Based Child Care Services
We provide full-service center-based child care at centers located at or near an employer sponsor’s worksite, as well as convenient locations within the community. We operate our centers under two principal business models: 
(1)a cost-plus model, where we are paid a fee by an employer client for managing and operating a child care center on a cost-plus basis; and
(2)a profit and loss (“P&L”) model, where we assume the financial risk of operating a child care center. The P&L model is further classified into two subcategories: 
•a sponsor model, where we provide child care and early education on either an exclusive or priority enrollment basis for the employees of an employer sponsor; and
•a lease model, where we provide child care and early education to employees of multiple employers located within a real estate development (for example, an office building or office park), as well as to families in the surrounding community.
In both the cost-plus and sponsor P&L models, the employer sponsor generally retains responsibility for the development of the child care center (which is owned or leased by the sponsor), as well as pre-opening capital equipment, and ongoing maintenance and repair. In addition, employer sponsors typically provide operating subsidies to support the ongoing provision of child care services to their employees if center operating costs exceed revenue from tuition paid by parents. Under all model types, we retain responsibility for all aspects of operating the child care center, including hiring and paying employees, ongoing training, curriculum, contracting with vendors, purchasing supplies, and collecting tuition. These arrangements with employer sponsors generally have a contractual term of three to ten years with varying terms, renewal and termination options.
Tuition paid by families generally represents approximately 90% of the revenue generated by this segment and is determined based on the age and developmental level of the child, the child’s attendance schedule (full-time or part-time), the geographic location, and the extent to which an employer sponsor subsidizes tuition. Based on a sample of approximately 360 of our child care and early education centers in the United States, the current average tuition at our centers is $2,075 per month for infants (typically ages 3 to 16 months), $1,925 per month for toddlers (typically ages 16 months to 3 years) and $1,645 per month for preschoolers (typically ages 3 to 5 years). Tuition at most of our child care and early education centers is payable in advance and is typically due monthly.
Table of Contents

Historically, annual revenue per center typically averages between $1.6 million and $2.1 million at our centers in North America, and averages between $1.2 million and $1.3 million at our centers in Europe, primarily due to the larger average size of our centers in North America. Our North American child care and early education centers have an average capacity of 128 children per location, while our centers in Europe have an average capacity of 83 children per location. Gross margin at our centers typically averages between 20% and 25%, with our cost-plus model centers typically at the lower end of that range and our lease centers at the higher end. In 2020, as a result of temporary center closures and disruptions to enrollment arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, annual revenue per center averaged approximately $1.0 million in both North America and Europe, which in turn contributed to a significant contraction in gross margins to approximately 1% for the year.
Cost of services consists of direct expenses associated with the operation of child care and early education centers and is primarily comprised of payroll and benefits for personnel, food costs, program supplies and materials, parent marketing and facilities costs, which include depreciation. Personnel costs are the largest component of a center’s operating costs and comprise approximately 70% of a center’s operating expenses. In a P&L model center, we are often responsible for additional costs that are typically paid or provided directly by an employer sponsor in centers operating under the cost-plus model, such as facilities costs. As a result, personnel costs in centers operating under P&L models will often represent a lower percentage of overall costs when compared to centers operating under cost-plus models.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SGA”) relating to full-service center-based child care consist primarily of salaries, payroll taxes and benefits (including stock-based compensation costs) for non-center personnel, which includes corporate, regional and business development personnel; accounting, legal and management/advisory fees; information technology; occupancy costs for corporate and regional personnel; and other general corporate expenses.
Back-up Care Services
Back-up care offers family support services for dependents of all ages and provides coverage when regular care falls through, as well as care coordination tools to assist families with their short and long-term care decisions. We provide back-up care services for children (primarily 0-12 years old) through our full-service centers and dedicated back-up child care centers, and in-home care providers, as well as through our proprietary back-up care network of quality child care centers and in-home care providers. In addition, we provide back-up care services for adults/elders through our proprietary network of quality in-home care providers. We also help to facilitate back-up care services through our self-sourced reimbursed care program.
Traditional back-up care offers access to a contracted network of more than 4,000 in-home care agencies and center-based providers in locations where we do not otherwise have centers with available capacity or available in-home caregivers. Our dedicated back-up centers are operated in a similar structure to full-service centers, and are either exclusive to a single employer, or have multiple employer sponsors and are part of our back-up care program. Self-sourced reimbursed care is a reimbursement program available to employer sponsors to utilize in emergency-type situations to provide payments to their employees to assist with self-sourced dependent care costs. Care is arranged online or via our mobile application as well as through a 24/7 contact center allowing employees to reserve care in advance or at the last minute. We operate our own contact center in Broomfield, Colorado and we contract with additional contact centers located in North Carolina and Missouri to complement our ability to handle demand fluctuations, provide business continuity, and deliver seamless service.
Back-up care revenue is comprised of fees paid by employer sponsors, and to a lesser extent, co-payments collected from users at the time of service. These arrangements generally have contractual terms of three years with varying terms, renewal and termination options. Fees for back-up care services are typically determined based on the number of back-up care uses purchased. Cost of services consist of direct expenses associated with the operation of dedicated back-up centers, fees paid to providers for care delivered as part of their contractual relationships with us, personnel and related direct service costs of the contact centers, and any other expenses related to the coordination or delivery of care and service. SGA related to back-up care is similar to SGA for full-service center-based child care, with additional expenses related to the information technology necessary to operate this service, the ongoing development and maintenance of the provider network, and additional personnel needed as a result of more significant client management and reporting requirements.
Educational Advisory and Other Services
Our educational advisory services primarily consist of Bright Horizons EdAssist Solutions and Bright Horizons College Coach. Educational advisory services revenue is comprised of fees paid by employer clients for policy consulting, program management, coaching, and subscription content, and to a limited extent, retail fees collected from users at the point of service. Contracts are typically one to three years in length, with varying terms, renewal and termination options, and fees are generally determined based on the services being provided and the number of program participants. Cost of services consist of personnel and direct service costs of the contact centers, and other expenses related to the coordination and delivery of tuition assistance and student loan repayment program administration, and educational advisory and counseling services. SGA related to educational advisory services is similar to SGA for back-up care.

Other Services.  Other services consists of Sittercity, an online marketplace for families and caregivers, which we acquired in 2020. Sittercity revenue is generated from subscriptions to a proprietary online search platform that helps families find child, senior, and pet care. 
Geography
We operate in two primary regions: (1) North America, which includes the United States and Puerto Rico, and (2) Europe, which includes the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and India. The following table sets forth information by geographic region for the year ended December 31, 2020:

 | North America | | Europe | | Total
 | (In thousands, except percentages)
Revenue | $ | 1,164,056 | | | $ | 351,037 | | | $ | 1,515,093
As a percentage of total revenue | 77 | % | | 23 | % | | 100 | %
Long-lived assets, net | $ | 370,275 | | | $ | 258,482 | | | $ | 628,757 
As a percentage of total fixed assets, net | 59 | % | | 41 | % | | 100 | %

Our international business primarily consists of child care centers throughout the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, with approximately 95% of the revenue generated in Europe related to the full-service center-based child care segment. As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 363 centers in Europe and 651 centers in North America. In 2020, we divested our child care center business in Canada and ceased to operate our two centers in that geography. Additional geographical information is included in Note 17, Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Seasonality
Historically, our full-service center-based child care and back-up care operations are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations. Demand for child care and early education services has historically decreased during the summer months when school is not in session, at which time families are often on vacation or have alternative child care arrangements. In addition, enrollment at our child care centers declines as older children transition to elementary schools. Demand for our services generally increases in September and October coinciding with the beginning of the new school year and remains relatively stable throughout the rest of the school year. Use of our back-up care services tends to be higher when schools are not in session and during holiday periods, which can increase the operating costs of the program and impact the results of operations. Our educational advisory and other services generally have limited seasonal fluctuations.

Results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of, among other things, the performance of existing centers, including enrollment and staffing fluctuations, the number and timing of new center openings, additions from acquisitions and center management transitions, the timing of new client launches in our back-up and educational advisory services, the length of time required for new centers to achieve profitability, center closings, the contract model mix (P&L versus cost-plus) of new and existing centers, the level of sponsorship payments, and general economic conditions.
Marketing
We market our services to current and prospective employer sponsors and their employees and directly to parents. Our salesforce is organized on both a centralized and regional basis and is responsible for identifying potential employer sponsors, and managing the overall sales process. Our marketing strategy includes digital outreach and advertising, direct mail campaigns, conference networking, webinars and social media. We communicate regularly with existing clients to increase awareness of the full suite of services that we provide across life and career stages and to explore opportunities to enhance current partnerships. In addition, we partner with employer sponsors to promote our child care and early education centers, and other workplace solutions as important employee benefits within their organizations. We work closely with clients to execute coordinated employee engagement plans and outreach that include targeted email, webinars, on-site events, and internal publications to drive awareness and utilization of the Bright Horizons benefits within their workforces.
As a result of our visibility among human resources professionals as a high-quality dependent care service provider, potential employer sponsors regularly contact us requesting proposals, and we often compete for employer-sponsorship opportunities through a request for proposal process. Our management team is involved at the national level with education, work/life and children’s advocacy, and we believe that their prominence and involvement also helps attract new business.
We also have a direct-to-consumer marketing effort that supports parent enrollment. The marketing team works closely with center directors and our contact centers to build enrollment. New enrollment is generated by targeted digital marketing, parent referral programs, direct mail campaigns, word of mouth and other outreach. We have expanded our marketing efforts with additional focus on maximizing occupancy levels in centers and we continue to invest in expanded digital marketing capabilities to personalize communication with our users, which over time is expected to drive increased utilization within the workforce of the employer clients and parents we serve.
Competition
We believe that we are a leading provider of employer-sponsored center-based child care, back-up care, and workforce education services. We estimate that we have approximately six times more market share in the employer-sponsored center-based child care market in the United States than our closest competitors. The market for child care and early education services is highly fragmented, and we compete for enrollment and for sponsorship of child care and early education centers with a variety of other businesses, including large community-based child care companies, regional child care providers, family day care (operated out of the caregiver’s home), nannies, for-profit and not-for-profit full- and part-time nursery schools, public and private elementary schools, and not-for-profit and government-funded providers of center-based child care. Our principal competitors for employer-sponsored centers include KinderCare Education in the United States and Busy Bees in the United Kingdom. We also compete for enrollment on a center-by-center basis with these providers, along with many local and national providers, such as Learning Care Group, Goddard Schools, Primrose Schools, Childbase, KidsFoundation, and CompaNanny in the geographies in which we operate. Competition for back-up care comes from IAC/Interactivecorp in addition to employee assistance programs and smaller work/life companies. In the educational advisory segment, competition comes from EdCor and Guild Education.
We believe that the key factors in the competition for enrollment are quality of care, site convenience and cost. We believe that many center-based child care providers are able to offer care at lower prices than we do by utilizing less intensive adult-to-child ratios and offering their staff lower compensation and limited or less affordable benefits. While our child care tuition levels are generally higher than our competitors, we compete primarily based on the convenience of a worksite location and a higher level of program quality. In addition, some of our competitors may benefit from strong local name recognition (such as established regional providers) or comply, or are required to comply, with fewer or less costly health, safety, and operational regulations than those with which we comply (such as the more limited health, safety and operational regulatory requirements typically applicable to family day care operations in caregivers’ homes). In the wake of COVID-19, we believe our enhanced health and safety protocols are market leading and an important consideration for families and clients. We believe that our primary focus on employer clients, underscored by our track record for achieving and maintaining high-quality standards, also distinguishes us from our competitors.

We have and continue to invest in technology to better support our full suite of services, to enhance our customers’ user experience, to improve utilization levels of our services within our client workforces and across our existing client base, and to deliver more efficient and automated support services. Investments to integrate our web and mobile functionality across all of our services as well as expand mobile capabilities are designed to ensure that our key systems deliver value and provide us with the platform to grow our position in the market. We believe we are well-positioned to continue attracting new employer sponsors due to our extensive service offerings, established reputation, position as a quality leader, and track record of serving major employer sponsors for more than 30 years.
Human Capital Management
Bright Horizons has been changing the way employees and their families work for over 30 years. To achieve this mission and to deliver results, we put our HEART Principles at the forefront of everything we do. Our HEART Principles — Honesty, Excellence, Accountability, Respect, and Teamwork — are the tenets of our mission and culture and are guided by the core belief that our people are the foundation to building and sustaining an organization that makes a significant impact in the lives of the children, families and adult learners we serve.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 26,800 global employees (including part-time and substitute teachers), of whom approximately 2,300 were employed as corporate, divisional and regional employees, and approximately 24,500 were employed at our child care and early education centers and as in-home caregivers. The total number of employees includes approximately 7,850 in the United Kingdom, 1,800 in the Netherlands and 50 in India, and approximately 2,200 of our total global employees remained on furlough as of December 31, 2020. Corporate, divisional and regional staff members make up our “Home Team” employees, and staff members working at our child care and early education centers, including teachers and support personnel, and in-home caregivers make up our “Field” employees. Approximately 30 employees at one child care center are represented by a labor union and we are currently negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with this union in good faith.
Our business is about serving people. Our success depends on attracting, developing and retaining talented and highly qualified employees. We are continually investing in resources and creating programs to drive diversity, equity and inclusion, to provide fair and competitive pay and benefits to support our employees’ well-being, and to foster personal growth and career development opportunities. We endeavor to create an environment that rewards performance, enhances our culture and employee experience, and retains and engages our talent. A few notable programs and initiatives are summarized below.
Our Benefits and Total Rewards
More than 1,300 top employers trust us for proven solutions that support employees, advance careers, and maximize performance, and we offer our own employees the solutions and services we offer to our clients. From on-site child care that amplifies our culture, back-up care to help handle disruptions in child care gaps, and education programs that build critical skills, we believe our service offerings help our employees achieve more.
We also offer a comprehensive total rewards program aimed at varying health, home-life and financial needs. Our total rewards package includes competitive pay, healthcare benefits, retirement plans with matching contributions, paid time off and wellness initiatives for our employees with benefits relating to nutrition, stress management and financial well-being, mental health, work-life balance and an Employee Assistance Program. We believe our total rewards package for teachers and center staff is robust and helps recruit and retain teachers in the industry.
Our COVID-19 Response and Health and Safety
Employee safety and well-being is of paramount importance to us in any year and was of particular focus in fiscal 2020. In response to COVID-19, our primary focus and attention is on the well-being and health and safety of the children and families we serve, the teachers and staff at our centers, and all of our employees. At the outset of the pandemic we created a cross-functional team to coordinate the Company’s response to COVID-19 and created enhanced health and safety protocols for all areas of the business as discussed elsewhere in this Item 1 under “Regulatory Matters — Health and Safety.”
For our center-based employees, during the early stages of the pandemic and the phased re-opening of our centers in mid to late 2020, we also provided direct supports including enhanced pay, free grocery staples and household necessities delivered to center staff at work, expanded back-up care benefits, and trainings on our COVID-19 health and safety protocols, and for all employees, we have provided enhanced paid time-off for those with COVID-19 and promoted telehealth benefits, including virtual mental health sessions. In connection with the temporary center closures in the U.S. and the resulting furlough of our teachers and staff, we offered continued support and resources, including health insurance coverage and ongoing training opportunities, including our Horizons Teacher Degree Program (discussed below).

Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Focus
At Bright Horizons, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are core priorities that we believe are critical to our long-term success by improving the work we do, the services we provide and, ultimately, the value we create. We are an organization made up of employees, children and families from many cultures, backgrounds and experiences and believe it is vital to have a workplace where all employees feel welcomed, comfortable and a sense of belonging and where everyone's unique differences are celebrated and valued. As an organization built around people, having diverse talent at the Board level and throughout our organization helps us recruit and retain talent and reduce turnover and enhances all our offerings and service lines and the education we deliver daily to children and families.
Our Inclusion Vision, in which we are committed to creating inclusive environments where everyone has a sense of belonging and has the opportunity to contribute and thrive in meaningful and impactful ways, guides and defines our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives. To bring this vision to life, we leverage the groups below to facilitate interactive activities, ignite and engage in bold conversations, and lead diversity awareness and inclusive leadership trainings, webinars and discussion groups:
•Inclusion Steering Committee — comprised of senior leaders and executive officers who inform the strategy for Bright Horizons’ overall diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
•Inclusion Council — includes representatives from Bright Horizons business units and functional departments, executive members, and co-chairs of our eight Employee Advisory Groups, and is guided by the Inclusion Steering Committee aimed at creating accountability in this area throughout the organization.
•Employee Advisory Groups — voluntary, company-sponsored internal associations dedicated to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment within the context of Bright Horizons’ mission, values, goals, business practices, and objectives.
We aim to hire a diverse workforce. As of December 31, 2020, workforce diversity representation was approximately as follows:

 | Gender (Global) (1) | Racial Diversity (U.S. Only) (2) 
Entire Workforce | 95% | 51% 
All Home Team Employees | 78% | 25% 
All Field Employees | 96% | 55% 
Board of Directors | 54% | 15% 

(1)Gender is defined as percentage of women in the workforce.
(2)Racial Diversity is defined as: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or two or more races.

We are focused on taking action to make real change, not for a moment in time, but for the long-term and, in 2020, launched a number of initiatives, including:
•Partnerships with HBCUs: We aim to create meaningful partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (“HBCUs”), by adding HBCUs to our Horizons Teacher Degree Program and our EdAssist Education Network, and also working in partnership with these schools to aid in recruiting and leadership development.
•Focus on Education and Training: We host trainings on Diversity Awareness, Inclusive Leadership and Confronting Unconscious Bias and are currently developing on-demand anti-racism and inclusion trainings to roll out to employees in fiscal 2021 and beyond.
•Race in America Series:  In partnership with our African Heritage Employee Advisory Group, we sponsored a discussion series on "Race in America" to provide a constructive forum for employees to share their voice and concerns.
Our Investment in Career Growth and Professional Development and our Horizons Teacher Degree Program
We invest in our employees’ career growth. Employee training and development opportunities are critical to our success as they drive our employee’s growth, help develop leaders within our organization (through our leadership institute) and support our delivery of quality services to our clients and the families and learners we serve. We provide a robust, ongoing employee training and career development program through our online training university, which includes online and offline components and interactive courses on topics such as management development, early education and leadership skills. 
For our teachers, we support their development through a number of programs and resources, including an extensive training curriculum and, in the United States, our eCDA (“child development associate”) program to enable us to deliver high quality services.
A central program offering is our Horizons Teacher Degree Program. The program, which is a first-of-its-kind offering in the early education field, removes financial obstacles for employees pursing a degree, including those posed by traditional tuition reimbursement programs, by allowing employees to earn an associate or bachelor’s degree in early childhood education at no-cost — participants do not have to pay for any expenses out of pocket, including tuition, fees and books. Since its inception in 2018, almost 2,000 teachers have enrolled and we celebrated our first graduating class this year.
Our Employee Engagement
Retaining and developing our workforce starts with our employees. For 20 years, Bright Horizons has listened to its employees through our Employee Experience Survey. Hearing directly from our employees help us to understand the employee experience, including evolving priorities related to workplace environment, employee relations, pay and benefits, flexibility, and career growth opportunities, all of which we see as critical to our mission to be and remain an employer of choice and a great place to work. During 2020, we conducted a series of pulse surveys to connect with employees to ensure that we continued to meet their needs and focus on their priorities. This approach enabled us to act on real-time information to expand our benefits as well as create unique offerings to our employees in response to COVID-19. These pulse surveys will remain an important channel for employee feedback, input, and recommendations.
Our Citizenship
We support the communities in which we work and live and we encourage our employees to do the same. We proudly stand behind our many employees who give their time to non-profit organizations, awarding grants to these organizations in recognition of volunteer work our employees do to give back to their communities. We also work alongside our employees to support the Bright Horizons Foundation for Children® and its important mission, to bring Bright Spaces® to children and families in homeless shelters and similar agencies helping at risk children and families, supporting our employees with Brightening Lives activities and Field and Home Team fundraising events.

These registrations are subject to varying terms and renewal options. However, not all of the trademarks or service marks have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business, and we are aware of persons using similar marks in certain countries in which we currently do not do business.

Regulatory Matters
Our business operates in multiple jurisdictions and we are subject to various national and regional laws and rules and regulations, including labor, licensing, health, fire and safety, and data privacy requirements and standards. While we incur ongoing costs to comply with these laws and regulations, there is no assurance that existing or future government laws applicable to our operations or services will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position.
The following discussion highlights our key areas of focus. For a discussion of the risks associated with the laws and regulations that may materially impact us, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Licensing and Child Care Centers
The laws and regulations relating to the provision of child care are numerous and complex. In most jurisdictions in which we operate, our child care centers are required by law to meet a variety of operational requirements, including minimum qualifications and background checks for our center personnel as well as adult-to-child ratios and various labor, licensing, and health, fire and safety regulations. Regulations may also impact the design and furnishing of our centers. We believe that our centers and operations comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations.
Health and Safety
The health, safety and well-being of children, families and staff is our top priority. We have always adhered to rigorous health, hygiene, and disinfecting practices, and now follow enhanced safety protocols, which continue to evolve as new learning around COVID-19 develops. Our enhanced protocols were developed based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control, state and local public authorities, and our partnership with medical professionals that specialize in pediatric infectious diseases. Our enhanced protocols currently include social distancing procedures for pick-up and drop-off, daily health screenings, the use of face masks by our staff, reduced group sizes to facilitate social distancing, and enhanced hygiene and cleaning practices. We have dedicated health and safety personnel and a Vice President of Global Safety, as well as centralized COVID-19 response teams that support our centers and other operations to ensure compliance with our policy requirements and practices.
We employ a variety of security measures at our child care and early education centers, which typically include secure electronic access systems as well as sign-in and sign-out procedures for children, among other site-specific security measures. In addition, our trained teachers and open-center designs help ensure the health and safety of children. Our child care and early education centers are designed to minimize the risk of injury to children by incorporating such features as child-sized amenities, rounded corners on furniture and fixtures, age-appropriate toys and equipment and cushioned fall zones surrounding play structures.
Each center is further guided by policies and procedures that address protocols for safe and appropriate care of children and center administration. These policies and procedures establish center protocols in various areas, including the safe handling of medications, managing child illness or health emergencies, and a variety of other critical aspects of care, to ensure that centers meet or exceed all mandated licensing standards. These policies and procedures are reviewed and updated continuously by a team of internal experts and center personnel are trained on center practices using these policies and procedures. Our proprietary We Care system supports proper supervision of children and documents the transitions of children to and from the care of teachers and parents or from one classroom to another during the day.
Table of Contents

We require the child care centers and in-home care providers that participate in our proprietary back-up care network to comply with our standards of quality, including regarding caregiver screening and background checks, and training. The delivery of our back-up care services is subject to ongoing oversight and monitoring to ensure the health and safety of the children and adults we care for.
Environmental
Our operations, including the selection and development of the properties that we lease or own, and any construction or improvements that we make at those locations, are subject to a variety of national and local laws and regulations, including environmental, zoning and land use requirements. In addition, we have a practice of conducting site evaluations on each freestanding or newly constructed or renovated property that we own or lease. We have no known material environmental liabilities at this time.
Facilities
Our child care and early education centers are primarily operated at or near work-site locations and vary in design and capacity in accordance with employer sponsor needs and regulatory requirements. Our North American child care and early education centers typically have an average capacity of 128 children. Our locations in Europe have an average capacity of 83 children. As of December 31, 2020, our child care and early education centers had a total licensed capacity of approximately 114,000 children, with the smallest center having a capacity of 12 children and the largest having a capacity of approximately 500 children.
We believe that attractive, spacious and child-friendly facilities with warm, nurturing and welcoming atmospheres are an important element in fostering a high-quality learning environment for children. Our centers are designed to be open and bright and to maximize supervision visibility. We devote considerable resources to equipping our centers with child-sized amenities, indoor and outdoor play areas comprised of age-appropriate materials and design, family hospitality areas and computer centers. Commercial kitchens are typically only present in those centers where regulations require that hot meals be prepared on-site.
