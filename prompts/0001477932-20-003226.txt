ITEM 1 BUSINESS
 
Current Status of the Company
 
In order to fund and conduct our business over the past few years, we have relied significantly on working capital obtained from private sales of our equity and debt securities to various accredited investors. Due primarily to our continued substantial operating losses for several years, we recently have been unable to continue raising such working capital as needed to support our business plan for future growth. And unless we are able to raise critically needed substantial additional funding to achieve significant future revenue growth, our current business model most likely will not succeed.
 
During the past year, our executive management has consisted primarily of two persons who are partners of our major affiliate, Capital Markets Solutions, LLC (“CMS”), and who have been serving us on an interim basis under the terms of a Consulting Agreement between us and CMS. This Consulting Agreement is described in Note 9 of the financial statements included in this annual report. These two executive officers were not compensated directly by us for their executive management services rendered to the Company, although their services were included as part of the monthly payments made by us to CMS pursuant to the terms of this Consulting Agreement.
 
Laurence Mascera, our recent interim CEO, has resigned his management position with us as of March 31, 2020, and we are currently seeking a new CEO to serve as our principal executive officer.
 
Because of our recent inability to raise additional capital, we have terminated employment of all of our fulltime employees, including any marketing/sales or development personnel. We also no longer lease any office, administrative or operational facilities other than a “virtual” office location in Minneapolis on a monthly basis from a business supplying such services.
 
For approximately the past twelve months, we have been unable to conduct any material marketing or sales activities due to lack of working capital. Our primary business operations have been focused on providing adequate software services from our Fision software platform to our existing customer base. We now conduct and outsource our operational and technical functions and activities through experienced outside contractors. We believe that our outsourced independent contractors provide adequate services for our current customers.
 
Background
 
FISION Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware in 2010 under a former name, and conducted no active business operations until December 2015 when the Company merged with Fision Holdings, Inc., an operating Minnesota corporation based in Minneapolis (“the 2015 Merger”). As a result of the 2015 Merger, Fision Holdings, Inc. became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and control of the Company was acquired by the pre-merger shareholders of Fision Holdings, Inc.
 
In connection with the 2015 Merger, we issued an aggregate of 28,845,090 shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of Minnesota Fision, and also issued derivative securities to holders of Minnesota Fision options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,868,575 additional shares of our common stock. As a result of this 2015 Merger, our pre-merger shareholders plus holders of our pre-merger derivative securities held less than five percent (5%) of our total combined post-merger outstanding common stock plus reserved common stock for all derivative securities. 
 
The 2015 Merger was accounted for as a “reverse merger” and recapitalization. Accordingly, for financial reporting purposes, our Minnesota Fision subsidiary was the acquirer and the Delaware parent was the acquired company. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and operations reflected in our historical financial statements prior to this merger are those of Minnesota Fision and are recorded at their historical cost basis; and our consolidated financial statements after this merger include assets and liabilities of both the Delaware and Minnesota corporations as well as the post-merger combined historical operations of both corporations. 
 
In May 2017, we acquired substantially all the assets of Volerro Corporation, a Delaware corporation based in Minneapolis and engaged in the development and marketing of proprietary cloud-based “content collaboration” software services. 
 
When used in this report, the terms “the Company,” “Fision,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” refer to FISION Corporation, a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned operating subsidiary Fision Holdings, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (including our Volerro software services).

Effective April 15, 2019 our Board of Directors appointed Laurence Mascera as our Chief Operating Officer and as a member of our Board of Directors.

Termination of Continuity Logic Merger

On August 3, 2018 the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Continuity Logic, L.L.C., a New Jersey limited liability company (the “Continuity Logic Merger”) to effect a merger resulting in our shareholders as a group and the equity holders of Continuity Logic as a group each owning 50% of the post-merger combined companies. This merger agreement was restated and amended on December 21, 2018, with a key provision of this amended Continuity Logic Merger providing that the parties thereto and their representatives were required to raise enough working capital to support the post-merger funding requirements of the combined companies, and also that the merger be completed by December 31, 2018. The Company and Continuity Logic conducted extensive due diligence regarding this merger during the last few months of 2018, but were unable to raise or receive future commitments from investors to provide sufficient capital to adequately support the anticipated post-merger combined business operations of the two companies. Accordingly, on February 4, 2019 Continuity Logic terminated this merger since it was not consummated by December 31, 2018 as well as insufficient working capital being available for post-merger business operations. The Company no longer has any relationship or involvement with the business or future prospects of Continuity Logic.
 
While the Continuity Logic Merger was pending, the Company made various bridge loans to Continuity Logic for working capital, of which a total balance of $857,242 is long overdue and still outstanding as of March 31, 2020. These loans matured on August 31, 2019, bear interest at 6% per annum, and a substantial portion of the Notes is secured by a first-priority perfected security interest on the accounts receivable of Continuity Logic. The termination of the Continuity Logic Merger does not change or affect the continuing obligation of Continuity Logic to satisfy the payment of these loans to the Company. We have commenced legal proceedings to attempt to collect the overdue principal and interest owed to us by Continuity Logic on these Notes. Accordingly, the Company took a reserve of $857,242 against the balance of the notes receivables, as of December 31, 2019.
 
Contemplated Business Combination
 
We are currently seeking a merger or other business combination, with our chosen target being a private software services company which could be complementary with our Fision business and structure. We believe our Company would be beneficial to combine with such a private entity due to our public status, our large tax loss position, our commercially developed proprietary Fision software platform, our customer base, and other benefits. We intend to only target and pursue such a merger with a private entity having substantial profitable revenues. 
Business of Company
 
We are an Internet platform technology company providing cloud-based software solutions to automate the marketing functions and activities of our customers. Our business is conducted through our Minnesota Fision subsidiary based in Minneapolis, which since 2011 has created and marketed software solutions to support marketing and sales enablement activities of both private businesses and public companies. 
 
We have developed and successfully commercialized a proprietary cloud-based software platform which automates and integrates all digital marketing assets and marketing communications of our customers, and thus “bridges the gap” between the marketing and sales functions of a business enterprise. Our primary mission has been to develop and offer software technology tools through our Fision platform to enable our customers to maximize their marketing assets and initiatives.

We are a software services company licensing our proprietary Fision software platform to automate and facilitate marketing functions and activities in order to promote and improve sales enablement of our customers. Our innovative cloud-based software platform is readily scalable to adapt to fast business growth of any customer, regardless of size. 
 
Our Fision software platform enables our customers to easily and quickly create and implement marketing campaigns to support their sales personnel while still emphasizing, protecting and enhancing their valuable brand assets. Use of our software solutions by our customers reduces substantially the time and cost incurred by them to produce and present marketing and sales campaigns and presentations for specific products or services. Every member of our customers’ marketing and sales teams, by having easy and automated access to all their digital marketing and media assets, is able to leverage the full power of their distinctive brands and marketing assets in every interaction with their consumers or buyers.
 
Our current and targeted customer base ranges across diverse industries of all sizes, including banks and other financial institutions, insurance companies, hotels and other hospitality enterprises, healthcare and fitness companies, large retailers, product manufacturers, software and other technology companies, telecommunications companies, and numerous other companies selling familiar branded products or services.
 
Our Fision agile marketing solutions provide three major benefits to our customers, which are (i) accelerating their revenues, (ii) improving their marketing and brand effectiveness, and (iii) reducing significantly their marketing and sales costs.
 
We derive our revenues primarily from recurring payments from customers having software licensing contracts typically having terms of one to three years and requiring monthly subscription fees based on the customer’s number of users and locations where used. We currently have licensing contracts with ten (10) customers using our Fision platform for their marketing and sales activities. The majority of our revenues are recurring, due to the nature of our contracts. Our ability to realize recurring revenues is a keystone feature of our business model.
 
We have marketed and licensed our proprietary software platform primarily through direct sales obtained by our management and in-house sales personnel, and also secondarily through the use of experienced independent sales agencies. 
 
The Fision Platform - Our Fision marketing software centrally collects, stores, prioritizes, organizes, streamlines, integrates and distributes the numerous digital marketing assets of our customers including videos, images, logos and other brand materials, presentations, social media content and any other material marketing assets. Using Fision’s automated software technology, these digital assets then become readily and immediately available for user access as determined by each of our customers. Our Fision platform is designed to provide any corporate marketing department with the ability to instantly and seamlessly update its sales force or other users with the latest digital marketing content and materials, while providing them with a simple, intuitive software interface to quickly find what they need on any digital device, anytime and anywhere. In particular, large enterprise customers with extensive global sales branches and networks have the ability to quickly and efficiently create and deliver customized sales campaigns or presentations to selectively targeted consumer audiences while conveying a positive, personalized and consistent brand experience. 
 
Advantages of our Fision platform include the following:
 

· | Substantial gains in both marketing and salesforce efficiency. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Customers - Our potential customer base is global and virtually unlimited, since our Fision platform software solutions are totally cloud-based and readily scalable, and include a multitude of digital tools and solutions which can provide significant benefits to the marketing and sales personnel of any commercial enterprise. We have received substantial recurring revenues from our primary customers for many years, and we regard our high percentage of recurring revenues to be particularly significant to our marketing strategy which emphasizes long-term relationships with our customers under written contracts. 
Cloud-Based Platform - Storage and operation of our software solutions platform along with the digital marketing and sales assets and related data of our customers are outsourced by us to reside and take place in the digital “cloud.” Providers of cloud services are typically referred to as “virtual servers” since they provide all digital data storage and software application services to their clients. Our cloud service provider is Microsoft’s Azure Cloud, which leading cloud-based platform offers readily scalable, high quality and secure cloud services capable of satisfying any increasing demand or changing circumstances in the needs of our customers or us.
 
We regard the hosting of our software applications, the ready digital cloud interface with our customers, and the storage of unlimited customer data provided by our premier cloud provider as being crucial to our operating strategy. Our major savings in expensive computer equipment, high salaried technology personnel, and costly security measures through our use of Microsoft’s cloud is vital to our cost of doing business. Moreover, we believe that our experienced and leading cloud provider is more effective in delivering our Fision software solutions to our customers than we could perform in any event.
 
Research and Development - Since inception, the Company has committed substantial financial, personnel and other resources toward research and development efforts and activities related to the integration, commercialization and improvement of the Fision proprietary software platform. Our past development activities have been conducted both internally from our former Minneapolis headquarters facility by our former experienced software development technicians, and externally from outsourced contracts with experienced independent software development companies and individuals. 
Our Industry - We have marketed and licensed our software products and services in the agile marketing segment of the broad software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry, with virtually all our revenues derived from our proprietary cloud-based Fision marketing software platform;.
Employees - Due to our lack of available working capital, we currently have no full-time employees. Our most recent interim Chief Executive Officer resigned and we are now seeking a replacement CEO. Our Chief Financial Officer provides limited services on a part-time basis.
Outsourcing – We currently outsource our software platform maintenance and operations and our accounting and administrative functions to various experienced independent contractors, some of whom were employed by us in the past. We believe that the software and other services provided by our outsourced contractors are adequate to service our current customers as required and to maintain our corporate functions in a professional manner.
Marketing Model
 
During our early years while our Fision software platform was being designed and developed, our marketing and sales efforts were directed toward local or regional small-to-medium sized companies having their operations conducted from one local or a couple regional facilities. Since our Fision platform was designed to be particularly beneficial for and adaptable to large size enterprises, however, in late 2017 we revised our marketing strategy and activities to target and sell our Fision marketing software primarily to large national or global corporate enterprises having many and widespread branches and operations.
 
Although our marketing focus for the past few years toward large commercial enterprises has been effective in achieving a material base of such significant large customers, we have been unable to generate enough increased recurring revenues from them to support our related increased marketing, operational and administrative costs. Unfortunately, the increased length of time of the sales cycle necessary to close licensing contracts with large enterprises has been substantially longer and much more expensive than we anticipated or had incurred while marketing to smaller companies, resulting in a substantial decline in our revenues over the past few years. And since we failed to close and secure enough large enterprise customers to achieve the necessary increased revenues to support any further material marketing, we terminated all sales and marketing personnel during 2019. We are attempting to raise material working capital to support a marketing campaign to attract additional large enterprise customers, but there is no assurance any such future funds will be available to us.
