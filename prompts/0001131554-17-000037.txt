ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Introduction
We have recently made a number of major announcements, including our acquisition of Intralinks Holdings, Inc. or Intralinks and the divestiture of our carrier activation business, which will help define the future strategy at Synchronoss. These transactions signify a pivot in our strategy to focus on our cloud, analytics and enterprise businesses moving forward. We believe that our “Synchronoss 3.0” strategy is laying the groundwork for our new growth vision. Our acquisition of Intralinks gives us an immediate enterprise pedigree, experience upon which to leverage our product portfolio, and go-to-market strategy providing a diversified customer footprint which allows for substantial cross-selling opportunities through Synchronoss. We believe that as one combined company, we can deploy enhanced enterprise and mobile solutions to our customers, while opening up new enterprise distribution channels across the world.
With the Intralinks acquisition, we believe that enterprise will represent a significant portion of our future total revenues, thus helping us further diversify our business model over the coming years. For our carrier business, key customer wins in our cloud and messaging businesses in the North America and Asia-Pacific regions are some of the strategic highlights of our business performance over the past year. We believe that we will be able to build on these customer wins to create a major opportunity for growth in our carrier business as we head into 2017 and beyond. On the enterprise front we are progressing with our strategic partnerships with Verizon and Goldman Sachs, as we have successfully built a strong pipeline of customer enterprise pilots across various verticals with a core focus on financial and healthcare markets.
During the fourth quarter, we had a number of successful conversions from our pipeline into signed deals, where our solutions replaced existing competitive deployments. During 2016, our sales force and strategic partnerships enjoyed some early enterprise customer validation, which is leading to additional subscription booking opportunities in our enterprise business. These partnerships, will now be part of our broader enterprise strategy that centers on the combined Intralinks-Synchronoss team driving our success forward.
We believe this foundation will serve us well as we build a comprehensive product roadmap and a go-to-market strategy for the enterprise market around identity, secure mobility, secure collaboration, and secure workflow platforms.

formation to two primary types of customers: service provider and enterprise customers in regulated verticals and use cases.
Service Providers, Retailers, OEMs, Re-sellers and Service Integrators
Our products and platforms provide end-to-end seamless integration between customer-facing channels/applications, communication services, or devices and “back-office” infrastructure-related systems and processes. Our customers rely on our solutions and technology to automate the process of activation and content and settings management for their subscribers’ devices while delivering additional communication services. Our portfolio includes: cloud-based sync, backup, storage and content engagement capabilities, broadband connectivity solutions, analytics, white label messaging and identity/access management that enable communications service providers, or CSPs, cable operators/multi-services operators, or MSOs, and original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, with embedded connectivity (e.g. smartphones, laptops, tablets and mobile Internet devices, or MIDs, such as automobiles, wearables for personal health and wellness, and connected homes), multi-channel retailers, as well as other customers to accelerate and monetize value-add services for secure and broadband networks and connected devices.
Divestiture of Call Center Operations
During the course of 2016, we strategically began the process of selling our traditional activation business. As part of this effort in late 2016, we divested a large portion of our Activation business to Sequential Technology International or STI, a newly formed company, to leverage the assets sold as part of this transaction to STI's existing global customer care operations.  STI is 70% owned by Sequential Technology International Holdings, an unrelated third party that was formerly named Omniglobe International. Omniglobe has been serving many leading carriers and legal entities around the globe, including customers like AT&T for over 10 years. We retained an approximate 30% ownership in STI.  Our remaining traditional activation software assets and application programming interfaces orAPI's will help facilitate new innovative platforms, aimed at accelerating the adoption of cloud and digital services for carriers and other customers. The divestiture of the service portion of the Activation business created a better overall solution for our customers as STI is positioned to capitalize on the combined experience of both teams and is expected to become a strong, global player, building on over a decade of call center operations.
Synchronoss Platforms, Products and Solutions
We provide platforms and solutions to help service provider and enterprise customers realize their own visions of mobile transformation in a variety of different areas within their respective businesses. We represent categorical points of entry for our customers to transform their relationships with subscribers and employees.
As mobile technology continues to transform the service provider and enterprise markets the value of our platforms, products and solutions is transforming along with it and enabling our customers to think and stay one step ahead of their competition. One common evolutionary shift lies in the value of data. Service providers are looking at ways to use data to fuel new revenue streams and enterprise customers are looking to data to create more effective context for improving the employee work experience, particularly in environments where a premium is placed on data security. We are able to use our platforms in powerful combinations to not only make more effective use of data such as messaging, user generated content, secure applications and sharing, but also to analyze that data to create new opportunities for our customers.

Enterprise Solutions 
Our Synchronoss Enterprise solutions support an advanced digital mobility experience for businesses and consumers enabling the accessing and protecting of their information. Our identity and access management platform helps consumers and business users to securely authenticate access to online websites to conduct e-commerce transactions or access important data. Our secure mobility platforms help users safely and securely store and share important data. Our solutions are based on understanding assumptions regarding individuals' behaviors by capturing who they are, what they are doing and how, where and when they are doing it. By doing this, our platforms help reduce fraud, improve cybersecurity detection/prevention and overall productivity. Our identity and access solution supports consumers by allowing them to self-register and verify their identities, while providing non-intrusive multi-factor authentication. At the same time, our identity and access solution enables businesses to be sure that the person at the other end of the transaction is the correct person. Our secure mobility solution combines the identity platform with a “bring your own device,” or BYOD, platform that is based on a secure container for accessing data, applications, content and personal information management tools like email, calendar, messaging and notes.
Our Synchronoss Enterprise solutions offer a best-in-class technology platform with purpose-built industry solutions that drive business outcomes for Enterprise customers including: improved employee productivity in a secure environment, greater agility and responsiveness to consumers, higher consumer loyalty and enhanced revenue opportunities, as well as proactively anticipating regulatory data/retention and privacy requirements.

Our Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform also has the ability to intelligently analyze a subscriber’s user generated content through image tagging, object and facial recognition, as well as metadata including location, time and date, sharing and other data profiles. This information drives an enhanced user experience allowing for smart features such as flashbacks, smart albums, etc., which also allows subscribers to effectively search a massive data base of content to find just the right piece of content without browsing. However, we derive the most value from this content through our ability to apply Synchronoss Analytics to analyze the context in which a subscriber collects content. This information can be used by our customers to create valuable incremental targeting of subscriber interests, creating a context that adds to the future monetization potential of subscriber data according to our service provider customers’ strategies and policies.
Synchronoss Mobile Content Transfer
Our Synchronoss Mobile Content Transfer solution is an easy to use product that enables a secure, peer-to-peer, wireless transfer of content from one mobile smart device to another in a carrier retail location or at home/work, etc. Our solution supports secure mobile content transfer across major operating systems including IOS, Android and Windows. Our Synchronoss Mobile Content Transfer solution can transfer select data classes that may include photos, videos, music, messages, documents, contacts and call logs, across operating systems with varying degrees of support in accordance with the openness of the platform.
Synchronoss Backup & Transfer 
 Our Synchronoss Backup & Transfer solution is a variation of our Synchronoss Mobile Content Transfer solution that offers the same peer-to-peer transfer of select data classes across smart mobile devices and major operating systems and also offers the ability to send supported data classes that may include photos, videos, music, messages, documents, contacts and call logs up to the cloud for temporary storage and then the ability to restore that content back onto that same device or to a new device with the same subscriber. This capability supports care channel use cases of securing content during a device wipe and also creates a value-added solution in the case of lost devices, cracked screens and other edge use cases. Furthermore, our Synchronoss Backup & Transfer solution enables the subscriber to establish a cloud account at the point of transfer and an auto sync capability to keep content backed up to the cloud account going forward. This unified experience is designed to drive cloud enrollment at the point of transfer (often during a new line or upgrade) and provide an opportunity to get content into the Cloud to reduce the time of transfer for the next upgrade.
Synchronoss Messaging
Our Synchronoss Secure Messaging platform was designed for demanding large-scale environments, with optional advanced email features. We cover the spectrum when it comes to multichannel messaging, security, identity management, and customization solutions, enabling service providers to transform email and messaging from cost centers to revenue generators. With an approximate 35% market share and more than 400 million mailboxes installed worldwide, we believe that we are the premier partner for service providers around the globe. We also partner with various companies for best-in-class traffic management, anti-virus, anti-spam, and anti-malware technology.

Demand Drivers for Our Business
Our products and services are capable of managing a wide variety of transactions across multiple customer delivery channels and services, which we believe enables us to benefit from increased growth, complexity and technological change in the communications technology industry and in several of the enterprise markets we are targeting. As the communications technology industry evolves, new access networks, connected devices and applications with multiple services and modes are emerging. More significantly, the accumulation of multiple connected devices per subscriber is creating new opportunities for network and cloud-driven service continuity. This proliferation of services and advancement of technologies is accelerating subscriber revenue growth, significantly expanding the types and volume of rich content accessed and stored by consumers and increasing the number of transactions between our customers and their subscribers. The technology advances are also continuing the demand for our products and services in the enterprise market segment, especially in the financial and life science sectors. Key elements of our demand drivers include: 
New and Richer Operating Systems and the move to 4G-LTE Networks
Device operating systems like iOS for the iPhone/iTouch/iPad portfolio, Android produced by Google, Windows mobile devices, and BlackBerry OS for the BlackBerry portfolio have accelerated the adoption and usage of smartphones. Other growing markets are in smart wearables and connected vehicles. Apple has watchOS and CarPlay, while Google has Android Wear and Android Auto, respectively. According to IDC, the smartwatch market has a compounded annual growth rate or CAGR of about 43% from 2015-2019.  For connected vehicles, BI Intelligence forecasts that 82% of all cars shipped in 2021 will be connected, representing a CAGR of 35% from 2016. In addition, the continued growth of 4G-LTE networks is expected to improve the customer experience with connected devices given the network’s higher data speeds and reduced latency. In addition, devices such as mobile routers and tablets can generate mobile hotspots. With fixed mobile broadband, mobile carriers and MSOs can also offer bundled services. At the same time, these networks are also focused on enhancing machine to machine communications.

Increasing Mobile Adoption Worldwide
According to estimates by the International Telecommunication Union in 2016 there were 3.6 billion active mobile-broadband subscriptions in the world, representing 49.4% of the global population, and this number is expected to reach approximately 12% fixed-broadband penetration globally by 2017. 
The massive penetration of smart devices in developing countries is causing a modernization of networks and IT capabilities in markets previously dominated by feature phones and standard telephony services. The nature of smart devices is to drive a massive increase in data utilization of high bandwidth networks, an increase in messaging and the creation of user generated content, or UGC, all of which lead to the need for Synchronoss products, solutions and platforms on a new scale to markets that are rapidly catching up to mobile transformation.
The Rise of User Generated Content
As smart phone data use grows, so does the creation of UGC such as pictures, videos and memes. The accumulation of UGC on mobile devices (where 1 trillion photos were taken in 2015) is on pace to outstrip UGC in computer hard drives. This creates a dilemma for users in terms of stranding content that is often perceived as being more valuable than their own device. At the same time, this proliferation of UGC also presents a formidable challenge when it comes to transferring content from device to device in retail. Our Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform solves both of these problems while improving customer loyalty, customer satisfaction and retail efficiency.
Big Data and Monetization
Along with the accumulation of UGC and messages, service providers are accumulating more and more data from all areas of their network. The collection of this data adds breadth to already deep customer data they maintain that is aimed at supporting their ability to deliver relevant offers to specific customers. Together, this data creates rich context creating a robust profile around millions and millions of subscribers. Service providers are starting to develop new ways to use “Big Data” to fuel valuable targeting for mobile ads and add new revenue streams to their existing service revenue lines. Our Synchronoss Analytics platform is used to create new insights on carrier data and add to the value of ad targeting. Our white label cloud and messaging services create additional rich context to add to our carrier customers’ already robust data. According to ABI Research, mobile operators will devote more than $50 billion to Big Data and machine learning analytics through 2021.
Messaging and the Consolidation of Email and Over The Top Players
Messaging such as e-mail is a standard offering provided by service providers to their subscribers. Recent consolidation of email providers in the global market is prompting a reconciliation of this offering across the globe. Messaging as a medium is moving beyond standard email and is fast becoming an interface for commerce. Service providers are seeing usage and monetization declining as a result of the rise in"over the top" or OTT messaging players such as Facebook, Line, What’s App, We Chat and others who are using advanced messaging to create commerce opportunities to give subscribers visibility to smart transactions within a sticky, high frequency environment. Chat bots, operating on artificial intelligence fueled from semantic analysis of messaging content are the latest entrants to create a “messaging user interface” that is linking subscribers and third parties together across multiple channels. According to Gartner, by 2020, the average person will have more conversations with bots than with his or her spouse.
Our track record of providing scalable, secure, white label email solutions to service providers provides a viable alternative to smaller providers or OTT partners. Service providers are not adopting new messaging clients to compete with highly competitive and viral OTT players; instead they are adopting the monetization techniques used by those players to extend subscriber information into third party applications and chat interfaces, creating stickier commerce opportunities. Our customers are using our Synchronoss Messaging platform, especially in the Asia Pacific market, to evolve service provider messaging into a cloud-centric commerce offering utilizing personal cloud, identity management and other advanced messaging protocols that will open up new revenue streams and allow service operators to compete with OTT providers in new ways.
Pressure on Customers to Improve Efficiency while Delivering a Superior Subscriber Experience
Increased competition, recessionary markets and the cost of network capacity have placed significant pressure on our customers to reduce costs and increase revenues. At the same time, due to deregulation, the emergence of new network technologies and the proliferation of services, the complexity of back-office operations has increased significantly. Customers with multiple back-end systems are looking for ways to help their systems interoperate for a better customer experience. In addition, customers are moving to automated provisioning systems that enable them to more easily purchase, upgrade or add new features, applications and content.

As a result, we believe our customers are looking for ways to offer new communications services more rapidly and efficiently to their existing and new customers. Increased competition and the demand for a superior subscriber experience have placed significant pressure on our customers to improve customer-centric processes. CSPs are increasingly turning to transaction-based, cost effective, scalable and automated third-party solutions that can offer guaranteed levels of service delivery.

Digital Transformation and Mobile
Today nearly all businesses are involved in some form of digital transformation to drive profitability, growth, innovation and customer and employee satisfaction. According to Forrester, digital transformation budgets will edge up into the billions of dollars.We provide essential, white label technologies to help service providers realize the digital transformation that we believe drives a 2x output in immediate gratification, omni-channel personalized service and customer ease and convenience of dealing with carrier services and networks. Our enterprise customers realize similar value in meeting the expectations of their employees by offering them solutions that address productivity, enable BYOD and facilitate these employees doing business from anywhere.
Security Fraud and Cyber Threat Detection and Prevention
Every year, there is an increase in the prevalence of threats against consumers and companies from a variety of sources.  The main point of attack are the user credentials that are used to access applications and commerce sites. As a result, it has become critically important to assure complete confidence in the identification and authentication of users. We believe our focus on security with respect to our products, especially our products focused on the Enterprise markets, is leading to a strong demand for our products worldwide. 
Consumer Identity Verification and Authentication
Consumers today are burdened with having too many username and passwords to manage across their personal and professional lives. They are looking for simple safe and secure identity and authentication methods. Through our joint venture with Goldman Sachs, our identity and access solution supports consumers by allowing them to self-register and verify their identities, while providing non-intrusive multi-factor authentication.
Growth Strategy
Our growth objective is to establish our platforms as the de-facto industry standards for enabling mobile transformation with service provider (CSPs, MSOs, OEMs, multi-channel retailers) and enterprise customers (secure vertical markets including Financial, Telecommunications, Healthcare, Life Sciences, Government, etc.). Our strategy is to expand our customer base by vertical market using our existing platforms to enable large scale product deployments while investing in organic and/or inorganic logical extensions of our product and services portfolios. We will continue to focus our technology and development efforts around improving functionality, helping customers drive higher average revenue per customer and subscriber retention, embracing alternative channels and allowing more capabilities for ordering bundled applications and content offerings across these same complex and advanced networks.
Key elements of this strategy are:
Expand our Product Portfolio to Service Providers. Given the explosive growth of connected mobile broadband devices and the increasing need to backup, restore and share content across those devices, our objective is to play a vital role in monetizing those devices with our Connect-Sync-Activate strategy. Methods of monetization may include licenses per device, maintenance fees, professional service fees, active user fees as well as data storage fees. Our prior acquisitions of cloud, analytics and messaging platform providers have enabled us to expand the functionality of our Synchronoss Personal Cloud, Synchronoss Messaging and Synchronoss Analytics platforms. We have also improved the scalability of these acquired platforms to offer a more robust solution to our customers. Once one of our deployments reaches critical mass, we believe we will be able to integrate other solutions to generate additional revenue creating new solutions and generating offers from service providers and other customers.
Expanding into the Enterprise Cloud. Following up on the success of our Synchronoss Personal Cloud offering, we have also leveraged this platform to support the increased need for cloud-based document sharing and collaboration needs in the Small and Medium Business, or SMB, area. SMBs rely heavily on CSPs for support of new trends, such as BYOD. Our Synchronoss WorkSpace offering, combined with our newly-acquired Intralinks offering and our Orbit platform, which we acquired through our Goldman Sachs joint venture are ideally suited for these types of situations, as they are designed to assure an IT manager that the organization’s employees can enhance productivity by using their own mobile devices, while still complying with the organization’s internal security and other IT policies. In addition, our Intralinks business has traditionally sold products directly into both SMB and large-scale enterprise organizations and we plan to leverage these relationships to sell our enterprise solutions.

Expand Presence of Consumer Products Into New Geographic Markets. Although the majority of our revenue has traditionally been generated in North America, we continue to expand globally, especially with our recent acquisitions of Intralinks and Openwave Messaging, which have helped expand our operations and customer engagements globally in EMEA, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. We believe that the growth of connected devices will further drive opportunities to penetrate new geographic markets within the coming years. The Asia Pacific and Latin America regions are of particular interest, as these markets experience similar trends to those that have driven growth in North America and EMEA.
Broaden Customer Base and Expand Offering to Existing Customers. As our existing consumer customers continue to expand into new distribution channels, such as the rapidly growing e-commerce channels, we expect that they will likely need to support new types of transactions that are well suited to being managed by our platforms. In addition, we believe our customers will require new transaction management solutions as they expand their subscriber customer bases, which will provide us with opportunities to drive increasing amounts of transaction volume over our platforms. Many of our customers purchase multiple services from us and we believe that, with our recent acquisition of Intralinks and Openwave Messaging, we are well positioned to cross-sell additional services to customers who do not currently purchase our full services portfolio.
Expand into Emerging Devices and Internet of Things Space. Various forecasts from industry leading sources have cited explosive growth in the non-traditional connected devices space. These devices include connected cars, connected homes, health and wellness devices and the health care domain. We plan on expanding our cloud platforms (focused on storing data from the varying devices to be stored securely in the cloud), in an effort to capitalize on the growth emerging from these new opportunities.
Maintain Technology Leadership. We strive to continue to build upon our technology leadership by continuing to invest in research and development to increase the automation of processes and workflows and develop complementary product modules that leverage our platforms and competitive strengths. By doing this, we can drive increased interest by making it more economical for customers to use us as a third-party solutions provider. In addition, we believe our close relationships with our customers will continue to provide us with valuable insights into the dynamics that are creating demand for next-generation solutions.
Leverage and Enforce our Intellectual Property. We have a significant repository of granted and filed intellectual property, including over 100 issued patents. We expect to use these assets as a differentiator of our products and services in the marketplace. We rely on a combination of our patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets in the United States and throughout the world, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We will continue to assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent and other intellectual property protections for those aspects of our technology and service that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages.
Customers
We maintain strong and collaborative relationships with our customers, which we believe to be one of our core competencies and something that is critical to our success. For our cloud and activation businesses, we are generally the only provider of the services we offer to our customers. Contracts for our cloud and activation business extend up to 60 months from execution and include minimum transaction or revenue commitments from our customers. All of our significant cloud and activation customers may terminate their contracts for convenience upon written notice and in many cases payment of contractual penalties. The contractual penalties we received for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were immaterial to our statements of income.
Each of AT&T and Verizon accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, with AT&T and Verizon, in the aggregate, representing 62%, 71% and 67% of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Although in December 2016, we divested our activation call center business, which included a portion of the services that we historically provided to AT&T, we will continue to generate revenue from AT&T from our activation software and professional services. We have Statements of Work for each of the Verizon and AT&T businesses that we support which typically run for 12 to 36 months. Although Intralinks has a diverse customer base and we expect that revenue from our Intralinks business will comprise a significant portion of our going forward revenue, the loss of either AT&T or Verizon as a customer would have a material negative impact on our company. We believe that if either AT&T or Verizon were to terminate their relationship with us, that they would encounter substantial costs in replacing Synchronoss' solutions. 
Sales and Marketing
We continue to develop a sales and marketing capability aimed at accelerating the adoption of our solutions by expanding penetration of existing industries, capitalizing on new opportunities in underpenetrated or emerging markets and by selectively increasing our geographic coverage.

We sell our services through a mix of field representatives, a direct sales force, a referral network and a select group of strategic and channel partners. Our sales representatives have extensive experience selling technology solutions into a wide variety of industries including communications, financial services, healthcare, insurance, legal and life sciences. Our sales teams are well trained in our platforms, products and service offerings and are instrumental in working with our customers to shape the solutions that are material to the growth of our current and prospective customers’ businesses based on the market trends and conditions that they are facing. This enables our team to easily identify and qualify opportunities where deploying one or more of our platforms would be appropriate and beneficial to prospective customers. 
Following each sale, we assign account managers to provide ongoing support and to identify additional sales opportunities. Typically our sales process for our solutions involves an initial consultative process that allows our customers to better assess the operating and capital expenditure benefits associated with an optimal activation, provisioning and cloud-based content management architecture. We generate leads from contacts made through trade-shows, seminars, conferences, events, market research, our Web site, customers, strategic partners and our ongoing public relations program. In addition to our direct sales force, we have established relationships with channel partners, primarily for our recently acquired Intralinks products that promote, sell and support our services in specific geographies. The channel partners for our recently acquired Intralinks business include, among others, systems integrators, resellers, referral partners, service partners and consultants that resell our Intralinks services directly or through a referral network. Our key channel partners for our Intralinks business are located in a variety of countries, including Brazil, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and a number of European countries.
We focus our marketing efforts on generating awareness of Synchronoss and its offerings by attaching brand recognition to key trends pertinent to our customers’ transformations. We do this through the creation of thematic and strategic content that is usually based on commissioned third party as well as original research for each of our market segments. We then market this research to industry editors in influential trade publications, media, thought leaders and press around the world. In addition, through our industry, product, and marketing communications functions, we also have an active public relations program to capitalize on recent news stories in key areas and industries.  We also promote the launch of new capabilities such as the new European enterprise datacenter and reinforce key capabilities including the Trust Perimeter.  Coverage has appeared in wide-reaching business outlets such as Bloomberg TV, Reuters, Fortune, Business Insider and Forbes.
We support these themes via direct marketing, digital marketing and conference presence throughout the year. We are active in numerous technology and industry forums and our employees regularly get invited to speak at tradeshows in which we also demonstrate our solutions. Key shows for our Communications & Media business include the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), GSM Association (Mobile World Congress), and Mobile Future Forward Series, Additional shows for our Enterprise business include Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), RSA, Gartner enterprise forums, M&A regional associations and industry forums, and additional enterprise mobility events. 

In addition, through our product marketing and marketing communications functions, we also have an active public relations program and maintain relationships with recognized trade media and industry analysts such as ABI Research, International Data Corporation (IDC), Gartner Inc., Forrester Research, Inc., Ovum, Frost & Sullivan and Yankee Group. We also manage and maintain our website, blog, social media profiles on LinkedIn, Twitter Facebook, instagram, YouTube and other channels, utilize search engine optimization and marketing, publish product related content and educational white papers, post videos and conduct seminars and user group meetings. Finally, we also actively sponsor technology-related and industry-related conferences and demonstrate our solutions at trade-shows targeted at providers of communications services. 
In our enterprise business, where there are millions of potential users across many industries, we have adopted a vertical markets approach aligned to key persons to focus on use cases with new capabilities to serve the needs of the Enterprise market. We have a deep expertise in understanding how organizations in regulated industries such as financial services or life sciences can collaborate and share sensitive documents safely and compliantly. 
Operations and Technology
 We leverage common proprietary IT platforms to deliver carrier-grade services to our customers across communication and digital convergence market segments. Constructed using a combination of internally developed and licensed technologies, our platforms integrate our order management, gateway, workflow, cloud-based content management, and reporting into a unified system. Our platforms are secure foundations on which to build and offer additional services and maximize performance, scalability and reliability.

Competition
We face different types of competitors in the markets we target that range in market share, focus and maturity. 
Competition in our markets is intense and includes rapidly-changing technologies and customer requirements, as well as evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions. We compete primarily on the basis of the breadth of our domain expertise, as well as on the basis of price, time-to-market, functionality, quality and breadth of product and service offerings. We believe the most important factors making us a strong competitor include:

• | breadth and depth of our transaction and content management solutions, including our exception handling technology,


• | carrier grade nature and scalability of our solutions,


• | quality and performance of our products,


• | high-quality customer service,


• | ability to implement and integrate solutions,


• | overall value of our platforms


• | references of our customers.

We are aware of other software developers and smaller entrepreneurial companies that are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with our platforms. We anticipate continued growth in the communications industry and the entrance of new competitors in the order processing and transaction management solutions market and expect that the market for our products and services will remain intensely competitive.
The competition in our Cloud and Messaging markets are generally divided among three types of companies:
Over The Top Providers
Companies such as Google, Dropbox, Apple, Facebook, Yahoo, What’s App, Microsoft and others are active and successful in marketing their cloud and messaging solutions directly to customers using a B2C model on a massive, global scale. Depending on the proclivities of a region, some service providers have entered into strategic partnerships with OTT providers, with these relationships showing varying degrees of financial success. Service providers generally have a strategic interest in protecting the relationship they have with their subscribers, providing value-add relevance to their networks and driving additional revenue streams. However, OTT partnerships do not always allow for this. Instead, they may offer the service provider a service with little to no capital investment required. The tradeoff between cost and business upside is under constant examination and varies from company to company. Recent privacy issues with Yahoo as well as the proposed acquisition of Yahoo by Verizon, a service provider competitive to other North American providers, has given many operators a reason to re-assess their messaging strategy.
Small Service Providers
There remain a handful of smaller solutions providers in the white label cloud and messaging space such as Funambol and Open-Xchange. These providers compete with us for smaller accounts in different regions of the world. In most cases, these providers offer low cost entry and revenue sharing as a business model but they do not provide the scalability, security or stability that appeal to Tier 1 service providers which is our major strategic focus.
Analogous Service Providers 
White label technology providers such as Amdocs, Ericsson, HP Momentum and others have a well-established strategic presence with large, Tier 1 service providers and are active in influencing their technology path as well as leading large-scale IT implementations. While these providers do not focus their businesses in the area of consumer offerings, they do have relationships with IT departments of these service providers and they often attempt to combine their offerings in other parts of their businesses. Therefore, we consider them as a factor in competitive initiatives, if not competitive offerings.
With respect to our recently acquired Intralinks business and our Enterprise offerings, the market for these solutions is highly competitive, fragmented and dynamic. We compete with a multitude of providers, including both virtual data room providers and enterprise software providers. The markets for online collaborative content workspaces and solutions for managing, distributing and protecting enterprise content are also rapidly changing, with relatively low barriers to entry. We expect competition to increase from existing competitors as well as new and emerging market entrants. In addition, as we expand our service offerings, we may face competition from new and existing competitors. We compete primarily on product functionality, service levels, security and compliance characteristics, price and reputation. Our competitors include companies that provide online products that serve as document 
12

repositories, virtual data rooms or file sharing and collaboration solutions, together with other products or services that may result in those companies effectively selling these services at lower prices and creating downward pricing pressure for us.
We believe that the principal differentiating factors for our Intralinks business and our Enterprise offerings are primarily the ability to collaborate inside and outside firewalls while maintaining security, control, auditability and compliance standards. We believe we compete effectively based on broad capabilities across all of these factors. In particular, our Intralinks solutions are specifically designed for inter-enterprise collaboration for content and information sharing beyond the firewall. Our Intralinks platform offers enterprise class scalability and reliability, while enabling secure, auditable and compliant information exchange via a SaaS delivery model that lowers total cost of ownership. Additionally, our industry-specific expertise, global customer support, scalability and reliability to ensure uninterrupted performance, as well as price and functionality, have earned us a reputation of trust with our Intralinks customers.
Employees
We believe that our recent growth and success is attributable in large part to our employees and an experienced management team, many members of which have years of industry experience in building, implementing, marketing and selling transaction management solutions critical to business operations. We intend to continue training our employees, as well as developing and promoting our culture, and believe that these efforts provide us with a sustainable competitive advantage. We offer a work environment that enables employees to make meaningful contributions, as well as incentive programs that are designed to continue to motivate, retain and reward our employees.
As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,765 full‑time employees. None of our employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreements.
