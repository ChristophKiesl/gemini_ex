Introduction
 
SCI Engineered Materials, Inc. (“SCI”, “we” or the “Company”), an Ohio corporation, was incorporated in 1987. We operate in one segment as a global supplier and manufacturer of advanced materials for Physical Vapor Deposition (“PVD”) Thin Film Applications. We are focused on markets within the PVD industry including Photonics, Solar, Glass, and Transparent Electronics. Substantially all revenues are generated from customers with multi-national operations. Through collaboration with end users and Original Equipment Manufacturers the Company develops innovative customized solutions enabling commercial success.
 
History of the Company
 
The late Dr. Edward Funk, Sc.D., and his late wife Ingeborg founded SCI in 1987. Dr. Funk, formerly a Professor of Metallurgy at The Ohio State University and a successful entrepreneur, envisioned significant market potential for the then newly discovered High Temperature Superconductivity (“HTS”) material YBCO (Tc of 90o K). Our first product was a 99.999% pure, co-precipitated YBCO 1-2-3 powder. Over the years we expanded our product line by adding other High Tc Powders, sintered shapes, single crystal substrates, and non-superconducting sputtering targets. At this time, we are not pursuing this market, but these early years of development are the foundation on which our material science experience is built.
 
We opened a subdivision, Target Materials Inc. (“TMI”), in 1991 to supply the increasing worldwide demand for sputtering and laser ablation targets. We became a full-service manufacturer of high-performance thin film materials, providing a wide selection of metals, ceramics, and alloys for sputtering targets, evaporation sources, and other PVD applications. We served the Research and Development market as well as the Industrial and Decorative Coating markets. During this time, we began to manufacture targets for the photovoltaic, flat panel display, and semiconductor industries.
 
SCI and TMI were merged in 2002. We continued to manufacture complex ceramic, metal, and alloy products for the photonic, photovoltaic, media storage, flat panel display, and semiconductor industries.
 
In January 2017, we received ISO 9001:2015 registration, an internationally recognized quality standard. We received ISO 9001:2008 registration in April 2010 and prior to April 2010 we were ISO 9001:2000 registered.
 
Throughout much of our history, we have conducted funded research primarily under grants from entities such as the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the Ohio Development Services Agency. These activities are generally limited to funded research that is consistent with our focus on near term commercial applications in our principal markets.
 
For more than three decades we have been developing considerable expertise in the development and manufacturing ramp-up of innovative materials, such as Transparent Conductive Oxides (TCO)s. The Company is committed to finding further growth opportunities that can benefit from this expertise. Today, we serve a diverse base of domestic and multi-national corporations, universities, and leading research institutions. We actively seek to partner with organizations to provide solutions for difficult material challenges.
 
Business
 
We are a supplier of materials to the PVD industry. Our customers need our materials to produce nano layers of metals and oxides for advanced material systems. Applications for PVD coatings range from everyday items to complex computer processors. Every day applications include automotive, transparent anti-scratch coatings on eyeglasses, coatings on kitchen faucets, as well as low emissivity glass for household windows. More technically advanced applications for our products include semiconductors, solar, flat panel displays, defense, aerospace, and photonics.
 
We continue to pursue niche opportunities where our core competencies give us an advantage and that complement our manufacturing capabilities. This disciplined approach enables us to focus on those opportunities that are the best fit for our capabilities and offer the greatest long-term return. Considerations include our core strengths, resource requirements, and time-to-market.

Photonics currently represents the largest market for our materials. We and our customers are continually identifying new materials that improve the utility of optical coatings. This includes improvements in their ability to focus, filter or reflect light, all of which increase the potential demand for the types and amounts of products we sell in this market. Photonic applications continue to expand as new methods are found to manipulate light waves to enhance the various applications.
 
In 2018, we began to supply target materials to the roll-to-roll coating industry. Roll to roll PVD coating is an emerging market in which intermediate manufacturers use our advanced materials to coat flexible substrates for a wide range of applications. In a roll-to-roll coating system, multiple layers of different materials can be deposited over large areas on flexible substrates without costly down time associated with breaking vacuum. These coated substrates can be used as standalone products in high volume consumer goods or can be laminated into electronic and optical components such as solar panels, architectural glass and displays. Our rotatable bonding technology, compounded with our material development capabilities, position us well in this emerging market for potential growth.
 
In December 2018, we announced plans to bond solar products in China beginning approximately mid-year 2019. This was established pursuant to a joint agreement with publicly owned Konfoong Materials International Co., LTD (KFMI). This arrangement was intended to enable us to especially provide an advantage to solar customers in China and enhance our access to this growing market. Due to external factors beyond the Company’s control, the facility has not produced finished products for customers in China as of December 31, 2020.
 
We continue to invest in developing new products for all current markets with emphasis on accelerating time to market.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had total revenue of $10,896,099. This was a decrease of $2,054,288 or 15.9% compared to 2019. Total revenue was adversely impacted by lower volume and COVID-19 related issues compared to 2019.
 
Our largest customer represented approximately 75% of total revenues in 2020 and 72% in 2019.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
Europe and Asia, as well as the Americas, have high demand for sputtering targets. We continue to expand our global marketing reach. We use various distribution channels to reach end user markets, including direct sales by our employees, and independent distributors and manufacturers’ representatives for international markets. We have manufacturer’s representatives in the Chinese, Korean and Taiwanese markets. Also, the internet provides tremendous reach for new customers to be able to identify us as a source of their product needs.
 
Our corporate website is www.sciengineeredmaterials.com. The website is designed to serve customers, suppliers, and investors with additional information in an easy-to-use format and includes expanded mobile access. There are also social media components, including LinkedIn®, Facebook®, and Twitter® to enhance the Company’s visibility and communication with all stakeholders. For customers and suppliers, there is expanded information about our product focus as well as a library of detailed product data sheets that continues to be updated. Investors can access current and archived information about the Company utilizing multiple electronic platforms.
 
Ceramics
 
We are capable of producing ceramic powders via several different processing techniques including solid state and precipitation. Ceramic targets can also be produced in a variety of ways depending on the end user applications. Production techniques include sintering, cold isostatic pressing and hot pressing.
 
Most of our products are manufactured from component chemicals and metal oxides supplied by various vendors. We have also identified several suppliers that are capable of minimizing potential disruption in our business.

Metals
 
In addition to the ceramic targets previously mentioned, we produce metal sputtering targets and backing plates. The targets are often bonded to the backing plates for application in the PVD industry. These targets can be produced by casting, hot pressing and machining of metals and metal alloys depending on the application.
 
Applications for metal targets are highly varied from applying decorative coatings for end uses such as sink faucets to the production of various electronic, photonic and semiconductor products.
 
We purchase various metals of reasonable high purity (often above 99.9%) for our applications. We are not dependent on a single source for these metals and do not believe losing a vendor would materially affect our business.
 
We have continually added production processes and testing equipment to enable us to manufacture and qualify many product compositions that can be used as PVD materials.
 
Competition
 
We have several domestic and international competitors in both the ceramic and metal fields. Many of them have resources far in excess of our resources. Process Materials, Inc., Tosoh, and Kurt Lesker are competing suppliers of targets.
Suppliers
 
Principal suppliers in 2020 were Johnson Matthey, Six Nine Metals and Silicon-HQ. In every case, we have established alternate vendors that can be used to ensure availability of required materials. As volume grows, we may enter into alliances or purchasing contracts with these or other vendors.
Research and Development
 
We continue to invest in developing new applications for our markets including electrically conductive Zinc Tin Oxide for Solar, Architectural Glass and Thin-Film Transistors. Specialty materials are being researched for use in niche markets such as additive manufacturing. Our development efforts utilize a disciplined innovation approach focused on accelerating time to market for these applications and involve ongoing research and development expense. We are developing sputtering targets for transparent electronic applications, which could be used to produce transparent thin film transistors via PVD processing.
 
We have ongoing development for product improvements and new Transparent Conductive Oxide for solar and wide area coating applications. Much of the development for these new products is based on doping zinc oxide (ZnO). We have developed considerable expertise working with ZnO from our aluminum zinc oxide (AZO) development. We are also developing a dielectric material for semiconductor applications. We focus our research and development efforts in areas that build on our core competencies.
 
We are working with customers through product trials and qualifications. We continue to invest in developing new products for all our markets including transparent conductive oxide systems for the solar and display markets as well as with our transparent electronic products.
 
We may seek funded research opportunities within our core competencies that maintain and expand technical understanding within our company.
 
We have certain proprietary knowledge and trade secrets related to the manufacture of metal and metal oxide PVD materials. This includes specific patents directly related to our products and market focus (see Intellectual Property section below).
 
New Product Initiatives
 
We are committed to the expansion of our core competencies into growth areas through continued exploration of our current well-established customer relationships and other burgeoning markets. We continue to develop target materials for the solar market in partnership with both original equipment manufacturers and solar cell panel fabricators.

We are also exploring material applications in differing manufacturing areas that can capitalize on our expertise and industry relationships. Additional product solutions involve materials such as tungsten and molybdenum.
 
Consistent with our growth strategy, we have identified niche markets that can benefit from our expertise in custom powder solutions, such as near infrared doped phosphors and short-wave infrared applications. These applications enable extended life of phosphors for specific nighttime identification needs of defense personnel and first responders.
 
Our research and development team includes a Ph.D. with a degree in Material Science. This knowledge base is integral to the achievement of product solutions. The applications in which we are involved require a deeper understanding than strictly material properties. Our team provides knowledge in the areas of optical and electrical properties in these applications.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our patent titled “Process for the removal of contaminants from sputtering target substrates” (US Patent No. 10,138,545 B2) was issued on November 27, 2018. This provides a process for the removal of contaminants on a spent sputtering target used in Plasma Vapor Deposition.
 
We have the rights to multiple patents for technology related to the application of Zinc Oxide based Transparent Conductive Oxide in Displays. Our patent titled “Display having a transparent conductive oxide layer comprising metal doped zinc oxide applied by sputtering” (US patent No. 9,927,667) was issued on March 27, 2018; a related patent having the same title was issued on April 7, 2020 (US Patent No. 10,613,397), and we have a corresponding patent issued in Sweden. The transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) we developed in these patents have excellent electro-optical performance, high transmittance, high conductivity, and good chemical resistance. These patents have various applications that include LCDs, micro-LED, OLED, smart windows and mirrors, AR/VR goggles, e-papers, and wearable electronics. Our clients, in relevant applications, are entitled to use the patent number when referring to the devices covered by the patent and benefit from it. We believe the TCOs claimed and protected in these patents have wide and innovative applications which can put SCI in a unique position in the market as well as bring us additional business opportunities.
 
We also have an additional Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent application relating to specific technology that protects our processes used in achieving superior bonding in planar and rotatable targets. We intend to file a regular application, or applications, claiming priority to this application in a timely manner to claim rights in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.
 
We have had a patent (now expired) for Fine-Particle Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O Having High Phase Purity made by a Chemical Precipitation and Low-Pressure Calcination method from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also have received a patent (also expired) for a process to join two individual, strongly linked super-conductors utilizing a melt processing technique.
 
In the future, we may submit additional patent applications covering various inventions which have been developed by us. Because the publication of U.S. patent applications can be delayed for up to one year, they tend to lag actual discoveries, and we may not be the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications for such inventions. Additionally, other parties may independently develop similar technologies, duplicate our technologies or, if patents are issued to us or rights licensed by us, design around the patented aspects of any technologies we developed or licensed.
 
We rely on a combination of patent and trademark law, license agreements, internal procedures, and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property, which may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products may be produced or sold may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
 
Employees
 
We had 21 and 22 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. One of these employees holds a PhD in Material Science. We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our relations with employees to be good. The employees do not have a bargaining unit.
