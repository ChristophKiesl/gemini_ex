Science 37’s Mission
Science 37’s mission is to accelerate clinical research by enabling universal access for patients and providers.
Science 37’s Vision
Science 37’s vision is to be the category-defining operating system that powers every clinical trial.
Overview
Founded in 2014, Science 37 pioneered the concept of agile clinical trials with a very simple premise: that clinical trials should begin with the patient. With approximately $195 billion spent annually in biopharmaceutical research and development and approximately $60 billion spent annually in serviceable clinical trials, Science 37 is disrupting a large market. 
Today, Science 37 continues to be a leader in agile clinical trials and in supporting decentralization approaches to clinical trials. We believe Science 37 is uniquely positioned as an operating system with both end-to-end technology to enable agile clinical trials and specialized networks to orchestrate trial execution. We also believe that Science 37 has more scale to manage and more experience in conducting agile clinical trials than any other company, having executed more than 100 clinical trials with over 500,000 patients engaged to date. By bringing research to patients and providers more directly, Science 37 helps sponsors speed patient enrollment, enable better retention and increase accessibility for representative patient populations, all of which helps accelerate the development of potentially life-saving treatments through faster study timelines and a more diverse patient population. Compared to the traditional model, Science 37 has been able to initiate clinical trials up to four times faster, recruit patients up to 15 times faster and retain patients at up to 28% higher rates. Additionally, enrollment through Science 37 has resulted in up to three times more diverse participant pools, better representing the real world population. As the commercial value of a drug is highest prior to its patent expiry date, these efficiency gains are critical.
Science 37 is addressing an industry that it believes is ripe for disruption, with the clinical trial model having been largely unchanged over the past 60 to 90 years. The traditional clinical trial model relies on a network of physical clinical research sites for trial execution, requiring patients to travel to a site for each visit. The infrastructure required for each site to operate, in addition to the fragmentation that results from each site using their own processes and technology tools, has given rise to a myriad of challenges, including slow start up, poor enrollment, high patient drop-out rates, and lack of diversity, all of which affect the timelines to launch life-saving drug treatments for patients. Only about 8% of patients are approached to join a clinical trial because most do not live near a participating research site. About 19% of the patients recruited do not complete the full study. In parallel, only about 5% of providers participate in clinical research due to the high cost and low incentives to house clinical teams or send patients out of their practice for a clinical trial. In the end, 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

approximately 85% of trials experience delays, 94% of them greater than one month, resulting in timelines as long as 13 years to launch drug treatments globally.
Through its direct-to-patient approach, Science 37 seeks to reduce the impact of the geographic barriers associated with conventional physical clinical trial sites, enable recruitment of virtually any patient, and provide patients with personalized support throughout the clinical trial journey. Science 37 believes that bringing the clinical trial directly to the patient addresses traditional-model problems around patient retention and engagement head on. Furthermore, Science 37 aims to offer a model for providers to seamlessly participate as investigators without all of the site infrastructure costs.
Science 37’s patient-centric model is powered by a category-defining clinical trial operating system and its team of approximately 600 employees with significant subject matter expertise. The backbone of the operating system is a unified technology platform, which is combined with Science 37’s specialized network of patient communities, on-demand telemedicine investigators, flexible mobile nurse networks, scalable remote coordinators and robust connected technologies.
•Technology Platform: Science 37’s full-stack technology platform is purpose-built for agile clinical trial execution and is designed to provide an end-to-end, single stop solution. The platform seeks to enable modern, digital approaches to clinical research by bringing together all parties, including the patient and trial investigators, nurses, coordinators and sponsors, to power workflows, centralize evidence generation and harmonize data. Configurable, pre-defined workflows ensure that patients and remote clinical trial teams remain in sync, enforce a standard operating process and facilitate ease of use, compliance and consistency. Science 37’s powerful data capture tools are designed to provide flexibility to support complex evidence generation. Virtually any assessment that is performed on paper can be digitized into Science 37’s platform. As soon as the information is submitted in the applications, data is automatically loaded into the platform with compliant audit trails and reporting for close monitoring throughout the study. Science 37 believes that its technology platform provides a common data infrastructure to enable the harmonization of data, both for internal monitoring and management as well as external data flows. Open Application Programming Interface (“API”) allows for the structured exchange of data in nearly real-time, including Electronic Data Capture (“EDC”) and Electronic Health Record (“EHR”) integrations. Architecturally, Science 37’s platform is cloud-based and multi-tenant with appropriate data segregation. Availability, scalability, and security are fundamental characteristics of the architecture.
•Specialized Networks: Science 37’s networks of patient communities, telemedicine investigators, mobile nurses, remote coordinators and connected devices are designed for the purpose of orchestrating agile clinical trials. Science 37 believes that these networks are unique in the agile clinical trial delivery space, and Science 37 has developed Standard Operating Procedures (“SOPs”) and comprehensive training on its proprietary methods of trial conduct. The power of Science 37’s networks is unlocked by its technology platform, which is designed to enable a centralized and unified clinical trial experience. Science 37’s networks continue to grow globally and across therapeutic areas to enable increasingly complex agile clinical trial designs.
•Extensive Configuration: Science 37’s operating system is highly configurable to support virtually any phase of clinical study and any indication. Science 37’s deep experience in executing agile clinical trials enables it to quickly and effectively activate its operating system to meet the specific needs of each customer.
Science 37 believes its strong relationships with its customers and its purpose-driven culture focused on democratizing clinical research have contributed to its rapid growth and strong repeat business. Science 37 forms close partnerships with its customers from the start, advising on best practices for clinical trial design all the way through execution. Science 37’s customers consist of large and mid-sized pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, Contract Research Organizations (“CROs”) as well as academic institutions. Science 37’s numerous strategic collaborations, including its enterprise technology collaborations and its Science 37 Certified program, empower Science 37’s customers and enable Science 37 to deliver agile clinical trials at scale.
Science 37 believes the concept of agile clinical trials is at an inflection point, with significant growth opportunities ahead. Science 37 intends to continue to invest in its core business, geographically, commercially and technologically, to reinforce its position in the market. Science 37 plans to capitalize on its specialized networks and proprietary technology to continue to expand its offerings across key verticals - including CRO partnerships, electronic clinical outcome assessment (“eCOA”) capabilities, real-world evidence, clinical care and diversity in clinical research. Science 37 has further stressed the importance of diversity, having established a Diversity in Clinical Research Foundation aimed at making clinical trial research more accessible to underserved populations. Finally, Science 37 believes the future of clinical trials will continue to evolve to include agile and decentralization approaches in tandem with traditional approaches, on virtually every trial - requiring networks of traditional providers, telemedicine providers, mobile nurses and remote coordinators, as well as a flexible operating system to seamlessly navigate between the on-premise and off-premise experience while capturing all 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

the data in one unified platform. Science 37 expects to continuously extend the reach of both its technology platform and specialized network accordingly. 
Science 37 has experienced significant growth in bookings and revenues over a short period of time:
•Gross bookings increased $118.7 million, or 192%, to $180.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. 
•Average contract value in Science 37’s qualified funnel increased from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
•Net new customers remained strong at 15 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 21 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
•Revenues increased 151.4% from FY 2020 to FY 2021, from $23.7 million to $59.6 million, respectively.
•From FY 2020 to FY 2021, net loss increased from $(31.7) million to $(94.3) million, respectively, as the Company significantly increased its staffing levels, investment in technology, and its commercial infrastructure to enable more rapid expansion of its offerings across key verticals and new markets and to become a publicly traded company. Additionally, the net loss was negatively impacted by the change in fair value of the earn-out liability for the period following the Merger Closing Date to December 31, 2021.
Traditional Clinical Trial Operations Have Many Challenges
With redundant processes, excessive resourcing and multitudes of disparate technologies, the traditional clinical trial model faces a number of challenges, resulting in slow start up, poor enrollment, high patient drop-out rates, and lack of diversity, all of which can affect the timelines to launch potentially life-saving drug treatments for patients.
 Central to the traditional clinical trial model is the establishment of a network of clinics, hospitals or hospital systems (commonly referred to as “sites”) across the countries of interest. It is from these sites the biopharmaceutical company who is sponsoring the study (known as the “sponsor”) collects evidence of drug efficacy.
 To facilitate this network, as illustrated in Exhibit 1 below, the sponsor typically employs large teams or hires a Contract Research Organization (“CRO”) to identify which sites are the most promising in terms of ability to recruit patients into the study. Then, another team often conducts feasibility assessments by contacting each of these sites to determine its interest and number of patients it believes it will recruit. The site identification and feasibility teams often continue this process until there are enough sites to secure the number of patients needed to fulfill the study protocol requirements.
 The site management team then typically contracts with each of the participating sites and trains the sites on the protocol before the sites can begin enrolling patients into the study. Once enrollment commences, on average 48% of these sites will fail to hit their patient recruitment targets and 11% will fail to enroll a single patient.
 Each individual site or site network often has its own silo of processes, procedures, technology and staff to choreograph the patient visits, procedures and evidence generation required to determine efficacy of the investigational product. Much of the clinical data is captured on paper at the site and then re-entered into an Electronic Data Collection (“EDC”) system. To reduce re-entry error, clinical operations teams often deploy an eCOA solution to capture some of the 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

more critical outcomes data; however, this usually entails procuring, programming, and shipping a data collection tool to each site or patient, and then coordinating return of the data collection tool at the end of the study.
Exhibit 1
 To ensure that each of these sites apply consistent measurement techniques, are compliant with the protocol, and properly re-enter evidence into the system of record, the traditional clinical trial design requires clinical research associates to travel (often great distances) and audit each individual site regularly throughout the duration of the study.
 All of this infrastructure is designed to enroll patients into the clinical trial as quickly as possible; however, only about 8% of eligible patients are ever even approached to join a clinical trial, because most do not live near a participating research site. Only about 14% of all patients who are recruited into clinical research studies come from communities of color, creating a sample that does not represent the commercial patient population which is about three times greater. Then, about 19% of the patients recruited fail to matriculate through the full study.
 In the end, approximately 85% of trials experience delays, 94% of them greater than one month, resulting in timelines as long as 13 years to launch drug treatments for patients globally.
Agile Clinical Trials Start with the Patient
Since its founding in 2014, Science 37 has championed the agile clinical trial model. Agile clinical trials recruit patients into clinical trials independent from a given site (often via media or referrals from patient associations, providers, pharmacies and payers). These patients are serviced by remote coordinators, telemedicine investigators, and mobile nurses who conduct visits from the comfort of the patient’s own home, eliminating the dependency on a physical site for clinical trial execution. Agile clinical trials can range from being fully virtual, in which all visits occur outside of an investigational site, to hybrid, in which a portion of the trial is conducted remotely.
Benefit for Patients: The Science 37 model is designed to remove the geographic barriers associated with traditional sites and enable recruitment of virtually any patient, in contrast to only about 8% of the eligible population that has ever been reached through the traditional model. In addition, Science 37 offers a patient-first approach, with easy-to-use technology for data collection, telemedicine for remote visits, and home visits planned around the patient’s schedule. This 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

approach to bring the clinical trial directly to the patient’s home seeks to address historical problems around patient retention and engagement.
Benefit for Providers: The agile model aims to address system constraints to participate in research for providers as well. Today, only approximately 5% of providers participate in clinical research due to the high cost and low incentives to house clinical teams, establish in-house SOPs and invest in technology. 
Science 37 offers a model for providers to seamlessly participate as investigators without the typical infrastructure cost. Science 37 provides easy-to-use technology for workflow orchestration, evidence generation and data harmonization; remote site staff to enable high quality trial conduct; and training and support from Science 37’s agile clinical trial experts.
Benefit for Sponsors: Coupled with unified SOPs and a technology platform to directly capture all data electronically, Science 37 believes that this agile clinical trial approach eliminates the need for clinical research associates to fly around the world to compensate for disconnected processes, procedures and manual re-entry of data that is typical of a traditional site network. In addition, as illustrated in Exhibit 2 below, it aims to eliminate the need for the infrastructure required to identify sites, conduct site feasibility, site contracting and training, so that sponsors can move directly to patient enrollment and evidence generation, saving both time and money. Additionally, the agile clinical trial model enables access to a larger patient population along with a less burdensome participation experience, all driving toward improved recruitment and retention and, ultimately, more time savings for sponsors.
Exhibit 2
Utilizing the agile clinical trial, patient-centered design approach, Science 37 has been able to start up trials up to four times faster, enroll patients up to 15 times faster, and retain patients at up to 28% higher rates, which are critical in the drug development process given that the commercial life of a drug is limited by its patent expiry date. If a typical drug can get to market three months earlier, it is estimated that between $54 million and $720 million of additional revenue can be generated over the life of that drug.
In addition to speed and patient retention, Science 37 has generated three times the participation from diverse patient communities, which not only represents a more socially conscious solution, but also one that takes into account a more 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

representative sample that is more predictive of how a drug will act in the true commercial population that will be using the drug.
Disrupting a $195 Billion Total Addressable Market
Global annual research and development spending has increased from $33.4 billion in 1993 to current annual spending of approximately $195 billion, growing at a 4% to 5% compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”). Based on its management team’s experience and knowledge of this market, Science 37 estimates that approximately 31% of this spending will be outsourced, resulting in a serviceable available market of approximately $60 billion. Science 37 expects this serviceable available market to grow at an approximate 6% CAGR over the next five years. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the General Economic and Financial Market Conditions and the Industries in which Science 37 Operates — Science 37’s estimate of the market size for its products and services may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market size is accurate, there can be no assurance that its business will serve a significant portion of the market.”
Exhibit 3
As illustrated in Exhibit 3 above, this current market is largely being serviced today by CROs (50%), home health vendors (17%) and Recruitment & eClinical solutions (33%).
•CROs provide sponsors with an outsourced suite of research services for clinical trial execution from drug conception through approval, including but not limited to trial feasibility and design, site selection, study startup and execution, biostatistics and submission support.
•Home health vendors typically provide medical staff that visit patients directly in the home to collect trial related data points, such as mobile nurses, physicians or phlebotomists.
•Recruitment and eClinical solutions provide point technology solutions often for the purpose of enabling data collection.
Science 37 believes it is well-positioned to benefit from several market trends, including outsourcing and clinical trial technology adoption:
•Outsourcing: Outsourcing has steadily increased over the last decade and remained consistent through the pandemic. Outsourcing trends are driven by biopharmaceutical companies’ desire to focus on core expertise and avoid capital intensive investments; comply more easily with global regulatory requirements; and realize cost efficiencies in trial conduct. Outsourcing as a percentage of total development spending by biopharmaceutical companies continues at 49%, compared to 36% in 2011 and 21% in 2001. CROs and sponsors expect outsourcing for early-stage and late-stage development (which includes real-world studies) to jump to 56% and 61%, respectively, within three to five years.
•Technology Adoption: Biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly bringing technology workflows and solution capabilities into the decision making process for trial execution support. In addition to Artificial Intelligence and big data, APIs for connectivity, real world evidence and wearable tech are of high focus for target 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

investment areas. The increased investment and adoption of these technologies is expected to result in additional use in clinical trials, accelerating adoption of agile decentralized clinical trials.
Acceleration of Agile Clinical Trial Adoption
Much of the growth in agile clinical trials was catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 and, eventually, nearly all clinical research sites were completely shut down. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), and other foreign regulatory authorities have issued guidance directing sponsors to implement agile clinical trial and decentralization approaches in order to maintain study continuity, and endorsed such techniques as viable, long-term solutions for study design and evidence generation. During this time, the traditional clinical trial model became largely inoperable, while Science 37 was able to continue to execute most of its studies without disruption.
The overall uptick in the adoption of agile clinical trials and decentralization approaches has been widely recognized and confirmed by industry leaders. According to an Industry Standard Research (“ISR”) survey of biopharmaceutical executives commissioned by Science 37, more than 60% indicate that their respective company conducted a clinical trial using at least some agile or decentralized clinical trial elements within the last year, with 4% reporting they conducted a fully virtual decentralized clinical trial. More than 80% expected to conduct a clinical trial using at least some agile and decentralized clinical trial elements in 2021, with close to one-in-six of these studies expected to be fully virtual, representing a 325% increase in fully virtual clinical trials conducted compared to 2020.
Over 95% of pharmaceutical executives agree that the agile and decentralized clinical trial technologies and methodologies adopted during the pandemic are here to stay. In the ISR survey, 17% of participants expected the increased adoption to fully remain; 26% expected adoption to further increase; 57% expected some elements to remain; and none of the participants expected adoption to revert to pre-pandemic levels once COVID-19 is under control.
Based on an industry survey of R&D decision makers, the majority of pharma and CRO companies are investing in efforts to accelerate decentralized clinical trial adoption, namely adopting patient facing technologies (64%), redesigning trial protocols (63%), and adopting investigator facing technologies (53%).
However, according to the ISR survey, 60% of sponsors indicate they have no infrastructure to execute decentralized clinical trials, making an outsourced operating system, such as Science 37’s, critical to clinical trial success.
Science 37 Agile Clinical Trial Operating System™ (“OS”)
Science 37’s patient-centric model leverages Science 37’s proprietary Agile Clinical Trial Operating System™ (“OS”), the backbone of which is Science 37’s technology platform, which is combined with Science 37’s specialized network capabilities.
Unified, Full-Stack, End-to-End Technology Platform
Science 37’s technology platform serves as the core of its operating system, designed to provide an end-to-end solution for trial execution. The platform aims to enable modern, digital approaches to clinical research by bringing together all participants to unify workflows, centralize evidence generation and deliver data harmonization.
Workflow Orchestration
Science 37’s technology platform offers a unique and effective user experience to orchestrate agile clinical trials. The workflow for each of the participants - the patient, the investigator, the nurse and the coordinator - has to be carefully choreographed to ensure simple, high quality and seamless interactions.
Patients use study-specific clinical trial landing pages to learn about clinical trials and sign up to participate. They create an account via the Science 37 web interface or by downloading a mobile application through which they are able to consent to participate. The mobile application is available in both iOS and Android and can be used on a personal smartphone; Science 37 can also ship a provisioned device if needed. Over the course of the clinical trial, patients engage via the Science 37 platform to seamlessly connect with the investigator and the rest of the clinical trial team. The platform is used for all clinical trial participation, including data collection, telemedicine visits, tracking appointments and communication with the clinical trial team. Over the course of the clinical trial, Science 37 employs proprietary Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) capabilities for automated and efficient recruitment and retention practices.
Science 37’s technology platform is designed to enable clinical trial-specific workflow configuration, enforcing SOPs across all clinical trial investigators and facilitating ease of use, compliance and consistency. The platform lays out all 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

visits, assessments and procedures, essentially prescribing the necessary steps, so investigators can quickly conduct appropriate actions in accordance with the clinical trial schedule of assessments. The platform progresses with each patient visit, so the investigator knows exactly where the patient is in the clinical trial journey and there is little ambiguity around what must occur in each patient visit. Furthermore, platform workflows aim to enable easy data review and approvals, with appropriate guardrails and signature requirements for increased compliance. By comparison, in the traditional model, a clinical trial site is typically given instructions for the procedures required at each visit, but is subject to their own processes and technology, resulting in an increased risk of poor compliance and thus the need for clinical research monitors to conduct regular on-site audits.
Through the Science 37 technology platform, Science 37 believes that investigators are able to perform all necessary clinical trial activities including conducting telemedicine visits and completing eCOA. Medical records can be pulled in from the patient’s EHR system via API automation, enabling expedited review of medical record information. Workflows also seek to provide easy tracking of Serious Adverse Events, Adverse Events and progress notes over the course of the clinical trial.
The nurse workflows are designed for high quality clinical coordination at every step. More specifically, the platform supports Investigational Medicinal Product (“IMP”) management, collecting lab data and the ability to input Clinician Reported Outcomes (“ClinROs”). Mobile nurses access the technology platform through mobile devices, enabling data collection easily in remote locations. Remote coordinators have the ability to schedule home visits, as well as coordinate scheduling across Science 37’s network of mobile nurses or nurses that may be facilitated by a sponsor, CRO or third-party home health provider.
The remote coordinator experience is centered around the ability to provide a concierge patient experience. The coordinator is able to manage the logistics of the clinical trial, including managing nurses, scheduling telemedicine or home visits, and the overall visit calendar providing maximum scheduling flexibility for the patient, allowing visits to occur at the most convenient time including evenings or weekends. The coordinator workflows support the telemedicine investigator as well, with coordinators completing assessment and direct data entry in concert with the investigator.
Finally, all workflows are supported for global conduct. This includes translation of the full patient experience in over 40 languages, including right-to-left languages. The technology platform also supports language translations for nurses, investigators, and coordinators in over 20 languages.
Evidence Generation
The Science 37 platform is designed to generate high quality evidence. With built-in configurations, virtually any assessment that is performed on paper can be digitized into Science 37’s operating system. Evidence generation includes patient reported evidence, clinical conduct evidence, device and wearable evidence, and real-world evidence. As soon as the information is submitted in the application, whether from a patient or another role, the data is automatically locked into the platform with a timestamp for audit purposes. Compliant audit trails and reporting allow for close tracking of data capture throughout the study. Digitizing evidence generation eliminates the need for manual data re-entry, associated data integrity risk or need for validation by clinical research associates on-site.
Patient evidence is captured through the mobile application, including electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (“ePRO”), Quality of Life assessments (“QOL”), health status information and symptom reporting. Notifications through the mobile application allow for compliance with clinical trial schedules of assessments. The Science 37 platform enables clinical conduct through digital means, including Remote eConsent, eSource, and ClinROs. Real world evidence can be supported by the Science 37 platform, including long-term follow-up studies, post-marketing safety, longitudinal data aggregation or observational assessments. Finally, device and wearable data can be supported, enabling remote monitoring and ongoing data collection (for example, looking at captivity or sleep monitors).
Data Harmonization
The Science 37 platform seeks to provide a common data infrastructure to support the harmonization of data, both for internal monitoring and management as well as external data flows.
Science 37’s rapid trial builder feature is designed to accelerate clinical trial start-up times with an easy-to-use, nocode end-user interface and form libraries that can be used to configure study-specific user permissions, clinical trial workflows and data capture assessments. Built-in previews allow users designing the clinical trial to confirm rendering across mobile and desktop devices. Unlike many data capture platforms, new assessments can be built significantly faster than traditional means and, due to Science 37’s modern infrastructure, updated in real-time, with verified changes immediately propagated across all applications. All improvements to the platform are made under strict change control, are validated using 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Computer System Validation best practices and pass User Acceptance Testing before being deployed to production. Finally, the platform allows for appropriate monitoring and oversight including remote monitoring capabilities, query management and real-time performance analytics.
Science 37’s technology infrastructure is also designed to enable seamless data flows and analyses. Open APIs allow for the structured exchange of data in near real-time, including EDC and EHR integrations. A sponsor may use an EDC to centralize data captured across sites, in addition to data collected via Science 37. Science 37’s platform integration capability eliminates the need for re-entry from Science 37 to EDC, removing this data integrity risk and providing sponsors with visibility into clinical trial data in near-real time as it is captured in Science 37’s platform. EHR integrations in the Science 37 platform allow for the immediate retrieval and centralization of a patient’s up-to-date and comprehensive medical records in the platform, providing investigators with a holistic view of a patient for clinical trial eligibility and conduct. Finally, the Science 37 technology platform supports broader data aggregation and analysis to support real-world data studies, including tokenization capabilities to allow for the de-identification of patient data across other large, diverse data sets, including medical records, claims, lab data, consumer data and more, to be combined with Science 37-captured data, so patients can be tracked over longer periods of time across multiple health data inputs.
Architecture, Security and Compliance
Science 37’s platform is a cloud-based software platform hosted by Amazon Web Services. Availability, scalability, and security are fundamental characteristics. The platform leverages a multi-tenant architecture where data is segregated between tenants. Science 37 takes a Security by Design approach to development and operation of the platform. Software engineering is performed in compliance with Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) secure coding standards. Risk is managed through a combination of security tools and SOPs that require a complete risk assessment of the platform prior to a production release. Science 37 employs a layered defense model to mitigate the risk related to malicious activity. Access to the platform is restricted to authenticated users using multi-factor authentication. Role-based access controls are enforced to restrict access to functionality and data so that only the appropriate users have access. All activity on the platform is logged and monitored to rapidly identify and respond to high-risk user behavior.
The platform is routinely subject to internal and third-party audits by Science 37’s customers in which the platform is assessed against Science 37’s security SOPs. The platform was designed and is maintained with consideration of FDA’s 21 CFR Part-11 regulations and related guidance, which address electronic documentation and signatures, and validation expectations, for records subject to FDA oversight. The platform is also designed to comply with HIPAA and General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) privacy standards. Science 37 operates product engineering functions in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization (“ICH”) Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) guidelines and prioritizes compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and regulatory requirements and guidance relating to data protection and privacy globally including, but not limited to, the GDPR.
Specialized Network Capabilities
Science 37’s specialized network consists of patient communities, telemedicine investigators, mobile nurses, remote coordinators and connected technologies and devices. Each aspect of these networks work seamlessly with Science 37’s technology platform and is designed for the purpose of orchestrating agile clinical trials. Science 37’s networks continue to grow to power increasingly complex agile clinical trial designs.
Patient Communities
Without the geographic restrictions of a brick and mortar site, Science 37 targets patients who are interested in participating in research without regard to location. This enables greater access to diverse patient populations including those who are not located near traditional clinical trial sites as well as those for whom traveling to a physical location might present a barrier to participation.
Science 37 utilizes an adaptive approach, powered by Science 37’s in-house clinical experts and data driven marketing plans, to deliver effective, efficient and seamless engagement campaigns. Science 37 regularly accesses its patient database of more than 500,000 patients to conduct feasibility surveys in advance of planning its outreach campaigns. The Company combines targeted patient research with deep clinical and marketing expertise to develop comprehensive strategies, tactical communication and outreach plans for each study.
Science 37 uses diversified, multi-channel programs to identify patients who fit the profile for each of its projects. This includes Science 37’s database of opted-in individuals interested in clinical research. Digital media supports the targeting of the right messages for the right audience at the right time and Science 37 uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to target its outreach to attract individuals who are the most likely to participate in the study. Additionally, Science 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

37 partners with its global network of healthcare providers to identify and recruit participants based on medical criteria. Through Science 37’s network it is able to identify specific providers who are best suited to bring on potentially eligible participants, and work hand in hand through the recruitment process. Finally, Science 37 has a series of partnerships that help ensure it is able to target patients through trusted channels. This includes partnerships with large national pharmacies, labs and health plans who have processes in place to refer highly qualified participants to clinical research studies, as well as large digital health portals with access to broad audiences.
Identifying patients is only the beginning of the journey. Science 37’s specialized team of patient engagement coordinators follow up with patients by phone, email and text/SMS to guide them through the pre-screening process, answer questions and support them as they consider study participation. The patient engagement coordinators utilize Science 37’s technology to create a personalized journey for patients to help bring awareness, educate and assess fit for clinical trial participation. Science 37’s model is flexible and reduces drop off in patient interest by ensuring rapid patient follow-up and allowing for warm hand offs from providers and other partners to create a seamless patient experience.
Telemedicine Investigators
Science 37’s network of telemedicine investigators are sourced on demand and across any therapeutic area and geography, which enables Science 37 to access patients from virtually anywhere. Science 37’s U.S. investigator network allows Science 37 to consent, enroll, and support study participants in any state and Washington D.C. The Science 37 global investigator network comprises independent GCP-trained investigators in Canada, Europe and Asia Pacific as well as telemedicine-based investigators who work with Science 37 through a broader institutional partnership model.
All Science 37 investigators are board-certified in their chosen therapeutic specialties and have appropriate medical licensure and certifications. All Science 37 investigators go through rigorous investigator onboarding and training on Company SOPs, GCP/ICH guidelines, FDA and other applicable regulations (global, state, etc.). They are also trained on the Science 37 platform. This training ensures they have the necessary clinical research foundation to be effective agile clinical trial expert investigators.
Investigator oversight responsibilities for an agile clinical trial are the same as those at brick and mortar sites, and are facilitated through the Science 37 study team and organizational personnel, along with the Science 37 technology platform. Through role-based permissioning, investigators have real-time access to all study data in the platform, which ensures participant safety and data integrity.
Mobile Nurses and Other Home Health Providers
Science 37 has an expansive global network of specially trained, mobile nurse providers who complete procedures within the participants’ homes and collect study data directly in the Science 37 platform. Science 37’s core nurse team consists of licensed RNs or providers with equivalent ex-U.S. credentials.
Science 37 mobile nurses are specially trained to complete procedures and capture data within participant homes. Depending on the study, mobile nurses may complete the collection of vitals, blood draws and other activities. Additionally, mobile nurses may take part as facilitators of physical exams, which can be performed by study investigators via telemedicine. Mobile nurses may also facilitate the unpacking, packing, and shipping of IMP in participants’ homes, as well as administration of IMP. Certain data collection and source documentation activities may also be completed by mobile nurses, as required for the study.
Science 37 mobile nurses operate under a single set of SOPs to create patient-focused and repeatable experiences. To ensure the highest and consistent quality, mobile nurses complete a mandatory, comprehensive training program, which includes remote and occasional in-person activities with a member of Science 37’s Medical Affairs team. Essential clinical skills required for specific protocols are validated through a robust demonstration and evaluation process. All mobile healthcare providers must demonstrate the ability to perform the tasks/skills independently and proficiently before being assigned to a Science 37 study.
In addition to mobile nurses, Science 37’s network includes additional mobile providers such as occupational therapists, physician assistants and nurse practitioners.
Remote Coordinators
Science 37’s remote coordinators choreograph Science 37’s clinical trials virtually. They are highly trained in the realm of clinical research as well as agile clinical trials. They ensure that all of Science 37’s processes are confirmed and 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

consistent. Unlike some traditional site networks, where each site has their own processes, Science 37 uses standard processes across all remote coordinators for every clinical trial that utilize its services.
The remote coordinator fulfills the requirements for clinical trial execution, i.e., consenting, screening, enrolling participants, scheduling study visits, data entry, etc. Furthermore, remote coordinators orchestrate patient activity in all phases of the clinical trial and are responsible for the continued engagement of study participants in clinical trials under the supervision of the investigator. All remote coordinators are trained on compliance requirements and expectations under Science 37 SOPs, GCP/ ICH guidelines, FDA laws and regulations and other applicable requirements (supranational, state, etc.). Finally, the remote coordinator is a key member of the Study Management Team, actively contributing to and meeting clinical trial execution goals and timelines, ensuring compliance with the study protocol, and ultimately securing a successful project. 
Connected Devices
Science 37 connects into clinical devices to be able to support clinical data generation in a robust fashion. Science 37 has demonstrated the use of technologies and devices in clinical trials, with use cases ranging from occasional data to serial data collection. Examples include accelerometers, smart pill boxes, glucometers, blood pressure cuffs, ECGs, heart rate monitors and more.
Three Offerings Enabled by Extensive Configuration
Science 37 derives its revenues primarily from two sources: (i) contractual arrangements to enable and enhance clinical trials through technology and/or services (Full Decentralized Clinical Trial and Metasite), and (ii) licensing of its proprietary Technology Platform to a variety of life science institutions. Science 37 focuses on three offerings, all with Science 37’s clinical trial operating system serving as the foundation:
1.Full Decentralized Clinical Trial. In this offering, Science 37 is the sole provider delivering for a sponsor. Science 37 is performing the entire clinical trial on its technology platform, including orchestrating all of the visits and activities.
2.Metasite. In this case, Science 37 acts as a virtual site to supplement a network of traditional sites. Science 37 leverages its technology platform and orchestrates the clinical trial, but is responsible for only a portion of the total patients associated with a clinical trial.
3.Technology. Science 37 is not conducting the trial, nor is it a Metasite, but configures the technology to support patient engagement, remote eConsent, eSource (eCOA, eCRF), telemedicine and/or 3rd party integrations as part of a broader trial solution. Science 37 has a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) option should the sponsor or CRO wish to deploy the technology themselves. Science 37 also has a “Technology Plus” model, in which specialized networks can be added to the technology solution, including patient communities, telemedicine investigators, mobile nurses, remote coordinators and connected devices.
This level of agility and high configuration capability enabled by Science 37’s specialized network of patient communities, on-demand telemedicine investigators, flexible mobile nurse networks, scalable remote coordinators and robust connected technologies enables Science 37 to support any phase of clinical study and nearly all indications.
Science 37’s Customers
The configurability of the Science 37 operating system allows Science 37 to meet the needs of each customer in a customized manner. Science 37’s platform accounts for the trial design, number of participants, therapeutic area, study complexity and use of home visits and electronic assessments for remote data capture. Science 37 is recognized as the leader in agile clinical trial solutions among its customers, providing a leading offering rooted in strong experience, and an architect of the future clinical trial design.
Science 37’s customers consist of large and mid-sized pharmaceutical companies, biotech customers, CROs as well as academic institutions. For the year ended December 31, 2021, three customers (PPD Development, L.P., Freenome Holdings, Inc., and Adagio Therapeutics, Inc.) each individually represented greater than 10% of revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, three customers (Boehringer Ingelheim, Freenome Holdings, Inc. and PPD Development, L.P.) each individually represented greater than 10% of revenue. 
As demand for Science 37’s capabilities has expanded, so has the depth and breadth of Science 37’s customer relationships. Science 37 has seen a 9.8% increase in average contract value in its qualified pipeline, from $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 to $2.6 million in the same period of 2021. Science 37 booked contracts with 15 new 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

customers during the year ended December 31, 2021. On a dollar basis, Science 37’s total qualified pipeline has grown 65.0% across Phase II and Phase III trials during the year ended December 31, 2021 since the prior year end. Science 37’s representative bookings during the year ended December 31, 2021 demonstrate the diversification in its business, with trials across all three offerings, a wide range of indications, diversity across Phases II through IV, US only and global, and contract values up to $22.6 million.
The majority of Science 37’s contracts with its customers range in duration from a few months to several years. Science 37 generally receives compensation based on measuring progress toward completion using anticipated project budgets and direct labor and prices for each service offering. In addition, in certain instances, a customer contract may include forms of variable consideration such as incentive fees, volume rebates or other provisions that can increase or decrease the transaction price. This variable consideration is generally awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets. Most of Science 37’s contracts can be terminated by the customer without cause with a 30-day notice. In the event of termination, Science 37’s contracts generally provide that the customer pay Science 37 for: (i) fees earned through the termination date; (ii) fees and expenses for winding down the project, which include both fees incurred and actual expenses; (iii) non-cancellable expenditures; and (iv) in some cases, a fee to cover a portion of the remaining professional fees on the project.
Competition
Science 37 competes at the intersection of companies that orchestrate clinical trials and companies with technology to support the orchestration of clinical trials.
Along the clinical trial orchestration dimension, CROs are typically engaged to execute the full trial on behalf of sponsors. Since CROs are predominantly service companies that are designed to orchestrate traditional, site-based clinical trials, technology is usually not core to their business, so they typically license these capabilities. In addition, the agile clinical trial model requires significantly different processes and SOPs than are utilized for traditional clinical trials, creating internal barriers to shifting models. While some CROs refer to Science 37 as a competitor, Science 37 views CROs as potential partners and a sales channel. This enables CROs to leverage Science 37’s operating system to help manage the shift in the industry to more agile, remote, decentralized trials. Science 37 has demonstrated its success with this strategy through its partnerships with and associated revenue from PPD and Syneos, and continues to engage additional CROs through the Science 37 Certified program. Other categories of potential competitors along the orchestration continuum include clinical home health and site management companies, neither of which typically own technology and manage only a fraction of what CROs typically manage.
On the other end of the spectrum are companies who provide technology solutions to support clinical trials. The vast majority of these companies, known as eClinical companies, are focused on making the traditional site model more efficient. Many of these companies have unique capabilities that can plug into Science 37’s operating system and, as such, have become partners, including physIQ Inc, Signant Health, ERT and AI Cure.
There are a handful of smaller companies who provide technology to enable decentralized clinical trials such as Medable and Thread. These companies have not existed as long as, and have not invested as much in their platforms, as Science 37 has. There are also full-suite technology players such as Veeva, Oracle and Medidata with more traditional, site-based solutions that may wish to compete with Science 37 in the future. Since none of these companies own similar specialized networks, have experience orchestrating agile clinical trials or have the same feedback loop as Science 37 to inform the user experience, Science 37 believes it has created a significant, long-term competitive advantage.
There are emerging players that have less developed orchestration and technology capabilities that are trying to emulate the Science 37 model; however, they are several years behind Science 37 and do not possess the same scale.
Social Responsibility: Democratizing Clinical Research
Social responsibility is core to Science 37’s mission-oriented corporate culture. Science 37 was founded to address structural hurdles in today’s clinical landscape that drive low patient and provider participation and result in slow timelines in getting life-changing therapies to market. Science 37’s model is designed to empower the patient while deeply engaging the clinical trial team of investigators, nurses, and coordinators, in order to disrupt the traditional trial delivery system and ultimately drive better outcomes.

It embodies the constant pursuit of better outcomes through commitment, sweating the details, ensuring clear lines of accountability, and adding a personal touch that builds better relationships. It is a pursuit of excellence, not only by each individual themselves, but also supporting colleagues to help everyone reach higher standards, all of which creates a virtuous cycle toward better outcomes.
•Gratitude and Respect: Most importantly, Science 37’s leaders, managers, and individual contributors take the time to say “thank you” for a job well done, for bold decision making and for supporting each other in the pursuit of its common goals. Science 37 treats others how it would like to be treated, and promotes gratitude and respect in all its interactions with its customers, its patients, and one another.
Science 37 has built its culture by recruiting and developing employees who are passionate about the Science 37 mission and its values. Science 37 strongly supports diversity efforts through its hiring process, employee training and awareness, and continues to foster professional growth opportunities within its diverse employee base. Science 37 has a collaborative and supportive remote work environment that encourages retention and engagement.
Science 37 is a performance-driven environment, and provides employees with goals and objectives aligned with driving customer success and shareholder value. Science 37 has a competitive pay practice, including performance-based awards for the purpose of attracting, retaining and motivating employees, executive officers and directors. None of Science 37’s employees are represented by a labor union, and it has never experienced a work stoppage.
Quality
Science 37 is profoundly dedicated to providing the highest level of clinical and operational quality. In Science 37’s culture of quality, every employee is dedicated to protecting and improving the experience of all stakeholders (patients, providers, CROs, sponsors and more) in clinical research. Quality is woven into every step - what Science 37 calls the ‘Science 37 Way’ - to ensure that trial planning and conduct meet Science 37’s commitments to all stakeholders from initial contact of a prospective sponsor to the final closeout of a study.
Contact to Kickoff: From the moment of first contact with a prospective sponsor through the deal process, and project initiation, Science 37’s team of subject matter experts, including medical directors, therapeutic heads, technologists, clinical operations and procurement, undertake in-depth and detailed solutioning for each project. To minimize risk and ensure confidence and quality, Science 37 accounts for its previous learnings, leveraging its knowledge base around best practices by phase, therapeutic area and protocol construct. Science 37 conducts risk planning from the onset, outlining assumptions, potential risks, and detailed mitigation plans, which Science 37 corroborates with its customers during a highly formalized kickoff meeting to ensure alignment, minimize ambiguity and forge a partnership in support of quality.
Kickoff to Conduct: After a formal kickoff meeting, as Science 37 prepares for project initiation, its cross-functional team works in lockstep to ensure they plan across every dimension. Science 37 develops project-specific execution plans to ensure alignment and proper escalation paths, and tracks progress against predefined operational and quality metrics. Science 37 leverages tools that reflect its experience in delivery, such as its detailed RACIs and step-by-step operational flows, which enable it to startup trials efficiently, in compliance and in accordance with its customer kickoff discussions. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

As part of conduct readiness, Science 37 Study Teams undergo training on all its SOPs, GCP/ICH guidelines, FDA regulations, data privacy, diversity and any other applicable topics related to both broader trial conduct and study-specific conduct. Additional periodic training is conducted to ensure comprehension. Science 37 investigators are board-certified in their chosen therapeutic specialties and have appropriate medical licensure and certifications. All Science 37 investigators go through rigorous investigator onboarding and training on company SOPs, GCP/ ICH guidelines, FDA and other applicable regulations. Similar certification is required of Science 37’s nursing network, and similar training is required across all other trial team roles.
Conduct to Closeout: In the third and final stage, Science 37 follows its detailed SOPs to ensure it stays compliant and can pivot as the trial progresses. Patient safety remains Science 37’s top priority. Science 37’s policies govern how it operates in all patient-centric touchpoints, particularly in the development of its technology platform and conduct of research; regular training for its employees ensures compliance with these processes. Science 37 is governed by a holistic Quality Management System (QMS) that meets the requirements of 21 CFR 820 Subpart B - Quality System Requirements. As independent oversight, the Science 37 Quality and Compliance function develops and executes an Internal Clinical Quality Audit Plan for each study. At the cornerstone of the QMS is the Quality Management Review, during which executive management reviews and discusses the overall health of the QMS. The QMS is designed to ensure, and seeks to demonstrate, that any issues encountered are addressed with an appropriate solution.
Intellectual Property
In the course of conducting its business, Science 37 develops and uses proprietary software, systems, processes, databases and other intellectual property. It seeks to protect its proprietary and confidential information and trade secrets through confidentiality agreements with employees, customers and other third parties, as well as implementing administrative and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information and trade secrets. Science 37 also relies on trademark laws to protect its brand, names, and logos. For example, Science 37 has applied for and/or obtained and maintains registration in the United States and other countries for numerous trademarks. Science 37 also enters into agreements with third parties for the license and use of their intellectual property, although no one such license is considered to be material to the business as a whole. Science 37 does not have any material patents or copyright; however, in the future, Science 37 may rely on patent and copyright laws, as may be appropriate and applicable, to protect its intellectual property rights.
Government Regulation
Regulation of Clinical Trials
The biopharmaceutical industry is subject to a high degree of governmental regulation in both domestic and international markets. Regardless of the country or region in which approval is sought, before a marketing application for a product candidate is ready for submission to regulatory authorities, the product candidate must undergo rigorous testing in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The clinical trial process must be conducted in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the United States and similar laws and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations require the product candidate to be tested and studied in certain ways prior to submission for approval.
In the United States, the FDA regulates the conduct of clinical trials of drug products in human subjects, and the form and content of regulatory applications. The FDA also regulates the development, approval, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, import, export, distribution, advertising, sale, and marketing of drug products. The FDA has similar authority and similar requirements with respect to the clinical testing of biological products and medical devices. Within the European Union, these requirements are enforced by the EMA, and requirements vary slightly from one member state to another. In the United Kingdom (“UK”), the requirements are enforced by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”). Similar requirements also apply in other jurisdictions where Science 37 operates or where its customers intend to apply for marketing authorization.
Some of these regulations apply directly to Science 37, as a clinical trial operator; others apply to Science 37’s customers, as pharmaceutical companies, and contractually to Science 37 as their service provider.
Clinical trials conducted outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted. These laws and regulations might differ from the laws and regulations administered by the FDA and other laws and regulations regarding the protection of patient safety and privacy and the control of study pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other materials. FDA laws and regulations may apply to clinical studies conducted outside the United States if, for example, such studies are conducted under an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”). It is the 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

responsibility of the study sponsor or the parties conducting the studies to ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled.
Science 37’s services are subject to various regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the clinical trial process. In the United States, Science 37 must perform its clinical development services in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and Good Pharmacovigilance Practice. The industry standard for the conduct of clinical trials is embodied in the FDA’s regulations for IRB, investigators and sponsor/monitors, regulations collectively termed GCP by industry, and the GCP guidelines issued by the ICH of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, which have been agreed upon by industry and regulatory representatives from the United States, the European Union, and Japan. GCP requirements address, among other things, IRBs, qualified investigators, informed consent, recordkeeping and reporting. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP requirements through periodic inspections. Violations of GCP requirements could result in enforcement actions including the issuance of warning letters, civil penalties, product recalls, criminal prosecutions or debarment, suspension or exclusion from involvement in future clinical trials or the submission of pre-market approval applications. Science 37 monitors its clinical trials to test for compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the United States and the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. Science 37 has adopted standard operating procedures that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements and serve as a mechanism for controlling and enhancing the quality of its clinical trials. Science 37’s current operating procedures are written in accordance with all applicable FDA, GCP, and ICH requirements and Science 37 is in the process of updating them to reflect EMA and MHRA requirements. This enables Science 37’s work to be conducted locally, regionally and globally in adherence to standards that meet all currently applicable regulatory requirements. Science 37 must also maintain reports in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements for each study for auditing or inspection by the customer and regulatory authorities.
Prior to commencing human clinical trials, a company developing a new drug must file an IND with the FDA or, in the case of certain new devices, an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”). The IND or IDE must include information about pre-clinical tests, chemistry, manufacturing and control data, and a study protocol for the proposed clinical trial of the drug or device in humans. If the FDA does not object in writing within 30 days after filing, the IND or IDE becomes effective and the clinical trial may begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IND or IDE for which modification is required, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. Clinical holds may also be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Submission of an IND or IDE therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin or continue a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND or IDE must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Each clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with an effective IND or IDE.
Clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review, approval, and monitoring, and may impose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. In some cases, an IND or IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
In order to comply with GCP and other regulations, sponsors of clinical trials must, among other things:
•comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified principal investigators and clinical research sites;
•obtain specific written commitments from the investigators;
•obtain review, approval and supervision of clinical trials by an IRB or ethics committee;
•obtain favorable opinion from regulatory agencies to commence a clinical trial;
•verify that appropriate patient informed consent is obtained before the patient participates in a clinical trial;
•ensure adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner;
•monitor the quality, validity and accuracy of data;
•maintain records regarding drug or biologic dispensing and disposition;
•verify that principal investigators and study staff maintain records and reports; and
•permit appropriate governmental authorities access to data for review.
In operating clinical trials on behalf of sponsors, Science 37 is required, either by contract or direct regulation, to comply with these requirements as well. Science 37 may be subject to regulatory action if it fails to comply with applicable rules and regulations. Failure to comply with certain regulations can also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials. If a clinical trial is not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the applicable regulatory agency may require that a clinical trial be modified, suspended or terminated, and Science 37 or its customers may be subject to a variety of enforcement actions. For example, violations could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning letter; suspension or termination of a clinical study; refusal of the FDA to authorize a sponsor to proceed under an IND or IDE for a clinical trial; refusal of the FDA to approve marketing applications, or withdrawal of such marketing applications; injunction, seizure of investigational products; civil penalties; criminal prosecutions; or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications. IRBs may also suspend or terminate research not conducted in accordance with IRB requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.
Regulation of Personal Information
Science 37 holds confidential personal health and other information relating to persons who have been, are and may in the future be involved in clinical trials or otherwise. The collection, possession, retention, use, transmission and disclosure of such information is highly regulated, both in the United States and the other jurisdictions where Science 37 operates, and Science 37 is subject to Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 and all regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act of 2003, among others. Additionally, Science 37 may be subject to State-level privacy, security and breach notification and healthcare information laws, including, but not limited to, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 and the California Online Privacy Protection Act. Depending on the services provided, Science 37’s operations outside the United States may be subject to privacy regulations and laws such as the GDPR in the European Union, the UK’s data protection regime consisting primarily of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (the “UK GDPR”) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 or the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) in Canada. Such laws and regulations may place restrictions or conditions on the export of personal data outside their applicable geographies, and/or impose additional requirements on service providers. In particular, the GDPR and UK GDPR include obligations and restrictions concerning the consent and rights of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or UK (respectively), security breach notifications and the security and confidentiality of personal data. The GDPR authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater. Additionally, the UK GDPR authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4% of global annual revenue or GBP 17.5 million, whichever is greater. European and UK data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws (including the UK GDPR) differently and impose additional requirements, which contributes to the complexity of 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

processing personal data in or from the EEA and/or UK. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices is often updated or otherwise revised.
Other Regulations
The foregoing descriptions do not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business. Science 37 also must comply with other related international, federal, state and local regulations that govern the practice of medicine (by trial investigators) and nursing (by mobile research nurses), as well as regulations that apply to employers and businesses generally, including, but not limited to, labor and employment and tax laws.
Any failure on Science 37’s part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research, the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities, fines and other sanctions, as well as liability to Science 37’s customers. Furthermore, any issuance of a notice of finding by a governmental authority against either Science 37 or its customers, based upon a material violation by Science 37 of any applicable regulation, could materially and adversely affect Science 37’s reputation and business. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate or failure to comply with such legislation and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business.
