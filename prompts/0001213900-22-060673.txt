ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction



Goldenbridge Acquisition Limited (“Goldenbridge,” “we,” or “us”) is a British Virgin Islands exempted company incorporated on August 12, 2019 as a blank check company for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, with one or more target businesses. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we currently intend to focus on opportunities in the artificial intelligence and any other related technology innovations market.



As a holding company with no material operations of our own, Goldenbridge Acquisition Limited conducts our operations through an office space in Hong Kong and our sponsor and certain of our executive officers and/or directors are located in or have significant ties to Hong Kong. As a result of us having certain of our executive officers and/or directors located in or with significant ties to Hong Kong, there is a risk this could result in a material change to the Company’s or the business combination target’s post-combination operations.



Goldenbridge is not a Chinese operating company, but an offshore holding company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”). As a holding company with no material operation of our own, we conduct our operations through an office space in Hong Kong. We currently do not have or intend to have any contractual arrangement to establish a variable interest entity (“VIE”) structure with any entity in China.



Because our operations are primarily conducted through an office space located in Hong Kong and our sponsor and certain of our executive officers and/or directors are located in or have significant ties to Hong Kong, we may be subject to unique risks due to uncertainty of the interpretation and the application of the PRC laws and regulations, including but not limited to the cybersecurity review and regulatory review of oversea listing of our ordinary shares through an offshore holding company. We are also subject to the risks of uncertainty about any future actions of the Chinese government or authorities in Hong Kong in this regard. Should the Chinese government choose to exercise significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business, they may intervene in or influence our operations. Such governmental actions:




● | could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our ordinary shares;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to continue our operations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | could significantly limit or hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our ordinary shares to investors; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | may cause the value of our ordinary shares to significantly decline or be worthless.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We are aware that recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in certain areas in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. Since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon the legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any. It is also highly uncertain what the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on Goldenbridge’s daily business operation, its ability to accept foreign investments and the listing of our ordinary shares on a U.S. or other foreign exchanges. These actions could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our ordinary shares and could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our ordinary shares to investors.



Based on our understanding of the current PRC laws, as of the date of this annual report, Goldenbridge is not required to obtain any permissions or approvals from any PRC authorities before listing in the U.S. and to issue our ordinary shares to foreign investors, including the Cyberspace Administration of China (the “CAC”) or the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”) because (i) the CSRC currently has not issued any definitive rule or interpretation concerning whether offerings like ours are subject to this regulation; and (ii) Goldenbridge operates through an office space located in Hong Kong and is not included in the categories of industries and companies whose foreign securities offerings are subject to review by the CSRC or the CAC. However, we believe that uncertainties still exist, due to the possibility that laws, regulations, or policies in the PRC could change rapidly in the future. In the event that (i) the PRC government expanded the categories of industries and companies whose foreign securities offerings are subject to review by the CSRC or the CAC and that we are required to obtain such permissions or approvals; or (ii) we inadvertently concluded that relevant permissions or approvals were not required or that we did not receive or maintain relevant permissions or approvals required, any action taken by the PRC government could significantly limit or completely hinder our operations in Hong Kong and our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.

If our target company is a company located in the People’s Republic of China, or PRC, or Hong Kong, or PRC Target Company, we are subjected to risks due to uncertainty of the interpretation and the application of the PRC laws and regulations, including but not limited to limitation on foreign ownership of certain industries, and regulatory review of an overseas listing of PRC companies through a special purpose vehicle, and the validity and enforcement of the agreements with a variable interest entity, or VIE, if our PRC Target Company requires any of these legal requirements post business combination by us. We are also subjected to the risks of uncertainty about any future actions of the PRC government in this regard. We may also be subject to sanctions imposed by PRC regulatory agencies including the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, if our PRC Target Company fails to comply with their rules and regulations. If the Chinse regulatory authorities disallow the VIE structure (as defined below) in the future, it will likely result in a material change in our financial performance and our results of operations and/or the value of our securities post business combination if our PRC Target Company requires a VIE structure, which could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For a detailed description of the risks relating to the VIE structure, doing business in the PRC or Hong Kong, and investment in our company as a result of the structure, see “Risks Associated with Acquiring and Operating a Target Business with its Primary Operation in China.” Additionally, we might be subjected to certain legal and operational risks associated with VIE’s operations in China if our PRC Target Company requires a VIE structure. PRC laws and regulations governing our PRC Target Company’s current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain, and therefore, these risks may result in a material change in VIE’s operations, significant depreciation of the value of our securities, or a complete hindrance of our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors. Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using a VIE structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. Since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on the PRC Target Company’s daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. For a detailed description of the risks associated with being based in China, see “Risk Factors — Risks Associated with Acquiring and Operating a Target Business with its Primary Operation in China.”



Furthermore, if we consummate an initial business combination with PRC Target Company or a company located in Hong Kong, we may use a corporate structure without direct equity ownership held by foreign investors. Therefore, a series of contractual arrangements may be entered into between the PRC operating entities, which are consolidated variable interest entities (the “VIEs”) of the combined company, as well as the VIEs’ founders and owners, on one side, and a PRC subsidiary of the combined company which may be a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, on the other side. To the extent that the combined company conducts its operations in China through its PRC subsidiaries and VIEs, such corporate structure involves unique risks to investors after the business combination, as the combined company does not hold any direct equity interest in the PRC operating entities. All of these contractual arrangements may be governed by and interpreted in accordance with PRC law, and disputes arising from these contractual arrangements may be resolved in court or through arbitration in China. However, the legal environment in the PRC is not as developed as in some other jurisdictions, such as the United States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce the contractual arrangements. As of the date of this report, there are very few precedents and little official guidance as to how contractual arrangements should be interpreted or enforced under PRC law. The contractual arrangements have not been widely tested in a court of law in the PRC and there remain significant uncertainties regarding the ultimate outcome of arbitration should legal action become necessary. As such, if we enter into a business combination with a China-based business utilizing a VIE structure, we and investors may face significant uncertainty about potential future actions by the PRC government that could affect the legality and enforceability of the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and, consequently, significantly affect the financial performance of the combined company as a whole. For a detailed description of the risks associated with this potential corporate structure, see “Risk Factors — Risks Associated with Acquiring and Operating a Target Business with its Primary Operation in China” and “Business — Initial Business Combination with a Company Based in China or Hong Kong” for further details on the VIE structure. Under the VIE arrangement, the dividends or other distributions to be paid by our future PRC subsidiaries to their overseas holding company will depend on such PRC subsidiaries’ entitlement to substantially all of the economic benefits of the VIEs, which are typically in the form of services fees or license fees payable by the VIEs to our PRC subsidiaries under various VIE agreements. Such contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in respect of our relationship with the VIE and we may be adversely affected if we experience difficulties in settling the amounts owed to our PRC subsidiaries by the VIEs. Regardless of whether we have a VIE structure or direct ownership structure post-business combination, we may depend on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries for our cash and financing requirements. Such dividends and other distributions may be subject to the PRC government’s regulations relating to the conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies and the remittance of such currencies out of the PRC, which may limit our PRC subsidiaries’ ability to distribute earnings to us or may otherwise adversely affect us. Furthermore, even though we may wish to transfer cash proceeds raised from overseas financing activities to our PRC subsidiaries via capital contribution or shareholder loans, the PRC government’s regulations relating to foreign exchange may limit our ability to make loans to or inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries or the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay back such loans to us.




2







Moreover, if any of our future subsidiaries incurs debt on its own in the future, the instruments governing such debt may restrict the subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to Goldenbridge Acquisition Limited. In addition, our future PRC subsidiaries and variable interest entities will be required to make appropriations to certain statutory reserve funds, which are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of a solvent liquidation of the companies. Current PRC regulations permit indirect PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, companies in China are generally required to set aside at least 10% of their after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of their registered capital. Entities in China may also be required to further set aside a portion of their after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund, although the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion of their boards of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation.



The PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of Chinese currency (RMB) into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if our future subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their own, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If we or our future subsidiaries are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations through the VIE contractual arrangements, we may be unable to pay dividends on our ordinary shares.



Cash dividends, if any, on our ordinary shares will be paid in U.S. dollars. If upon consummation of our business combination we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10.0%. If we have a VIE structure upon consummation of our initial business combination, in order for us to pay dividends to our shareholders, we will rely on payments made from the VIE to us. Certain payments from the VIE may be subject to PRC taxes, including business taxes and value added tax (VAT). Due to (i) the risks of doing business in the PRC and Hong Kong, (ii) we conduct our operations through an office space in Hong Kong, and (iii) our sponsor and certain of our executive officers and/or directors are located in or have significant ties to Hong Kong, we may be a less attractive partner to target companies than a non-PRC or non-Hong Kong based SPAC, which may therefore make it more likely for us to consummate a business combination with a target company located in the PRC or Hong Kong.

Indemnification



Until six (6) months from and after the closing date, the Principal Shareholders of SunCar agreed to indemnify Purchaser from any and all losses incurred or sustained by the Purchaser as a result of or in connection with any breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment of any of the representations, warranties and covenants of SunCar contained in the Agreement.

In connection with the closing of the transactions, Purchaser will enter into Lock-Up Agreements with certain SunCar shareholders, which will provide that such SunCar shareholders will not, within twelve (12) months from the closing of the business combination and subject to certain exceptions, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of the ordinary shares issued in connection with the Acquisition Merger, enter into a transaction that would have the same effect, or enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such shares, whether any of these transactions are to be settled by delivery of any such shares, in cash, or otherwise.

PRC Limitation on Overseas Listing and Share Issuances (Post Business Combination)



As we do not have any material operations in China, given that (a) the CSRC currently has not issued any definitive rule or interpretation concerning whether offerings like ours under our prospectus dated on March 1, 2021 relating to our initial public offering are subject to the M&A Regulations (as defined hereinafter); and (b) our company is a blank check company newly incorporated in the British Virgin Islands rather than in China and currently our company does not own or control any equity interest in any PRC company or operate any business in China, we believe that we are not required to obtain any licenses or approvals, under applicable PRC laws and regulations, for offering securities to foreign investors and while seeking a target for the initial business combination. We also believe we are not required to obtain approvals from any PRC government authorities, including the CSRC or the Cyberspace Administration of China (the “CAC”), or any other government entity, to operate and to issue our securities to foreign investors and to list on a U.S. exchange. As of the date of this report, we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, sanctions or regulatory objection to our offering from the CSRC or any other PRC governmental authorities. However, applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations of PRC may change, and the relevant PRC government agencies could reach a different conclusion and may subject us to a stringent approval process from the relevant government entities in connection with our offering, continued listing on a U.S. exchange, the potential business combination, the issuance of shares or the maintenance of our status as a publicly listed company outside China, and the post business combination entity’s PRC operations if our business combination target is a PRC Target Company. It is uncertain when and whether we will be required to obtain permission from the PRC government to continue to list on a U.S. exchange in the future and offer our securities to foreign investors. If we (i) do not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals, should the approval be required in the future by the PRC government, (ii) inadvertently conclude that such permissions or approvals are not required, or (iii) applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and we are required to obtain such permissions or approvals in the future, and we are denied permissions or approvals from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges or offer our securities to foreign investors, we may not be able to continue listing on a U.S. exchange or be subject to other severe consequences, which would materially affect the interest of the investors. In addition, any changes in PRC law, regulations, or interpretations may severely affect our operations after our offering. The use of the term “operate” and “operations” includes the process of searching for a target business and conducting related activities. To that extent, we may not be able to conduct the process of searching for a potential target company in China. For more detailed information, see “Risks Associated with Acquiring and Operating a Target Business with its Primary Operation in China — The approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission is not required in connection with our offering, however, if required, we cannot predict whether we will be able to obtain such approval.” and “We and our initial business combination may be subject to a variety of PRC laws and other obligations regarding cybersecurity and data protection and we may have to spend additional resources and incur additional time delays to complete any such business combination or be prevented from pursuing certain investment opportunities.”



On March 4, 2021, the Company consummated the initial public offering (“IPO”) of 5,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share (“Ordinary Share”), one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per whole share, and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of an Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 750,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any. In addition, the Company sold to Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim”), for $100, an option to purchase up to 375,000 units exercisable at $11.50 per unit, commencing on the later of the consummation of a business combination and six months from the effective date of the Registration Statement.

Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with our Sponsor of 350,000 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds of $3,500,000. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO, except that the warrants underlying the Private Units will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. Additionally, because the Private Units were issued in a private transaction, the initial purchasers and their permitted transferees will be allowed to exercise the warrants included in the Private Units for cash even if a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants is not effective and receive unregistered ordinary shares. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. Such Initial Purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.



The underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full on March 9, 2021, and the closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units occurred on March 11, 2021. The sale of 750,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $7,500,000.



A total of $57,500,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the over-allotment option units) and the private placements on March 4, 2021 and March 11, 2021, were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders at Morgan Stanley maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of the completion of an initial business combination within the required time period or our entry into liquidation if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period. On April 6, 2021, our ordinary shares, warrants and rights underlying the Units sold in our IPO began to trade separately on a voluntary basis.



Since our IPO, our sole business activity has been identifying and evaluating suitable acquisition transaction candidates.



Management is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of its operations, and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.



Trading in our securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor. In that case, Nasdaq could delist our securities. The delisting of our securities, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment. Additionally, the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections may deprive our investors with the benefits of such inspections. For more detailed information, see “Risk Factors - Trading in our securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor. In that case, Nasdaq could delist our securities. The delisting of our securities, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment. Additionally, the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections may deprive our investors with the benefits of such inspections.” Our auditor is based in the United States and subject to inspection by PCAOB.



Our Management Team



We will seek to capitalize on the comprehensive experience and contacts of our executive officers in consummating an initial business combination. Our management team is currently comprised of Yongsheng Liu, Chairman,Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and Ray Chen, our Chief Operating Officer. Our management team brings a wealth of experience in identifying, negotiating with and conducting due diligence on potential candidates for acquisition.




Mr. Liu and Mr. Chen have experience with initial public offerings and business combinations for blank check companies. They have worked together on the formation, initial public offering and business combination for Wealthbridge Acquisition Limited (“Wealthbridge”) and Goldenstone Acquisition Limited (“Goldenstone”). Mr. Liu served as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Wealthbridge which consummated an initial public offering in February 2019 and closed its business combination with Scienjoy Inc. (“Scienjoy”) in May 2020, and has been serving as vice chairman of Scienjoy’s board of director since May 2020. Mr. Liu has served as the Chief Operating Officer of Goldenstone since April 2021. Mr. Chen served as Chief Operating Officer of Wealthbridge until May 2020 and currently serves as investor relation consultant of Scienjoy. Mr. Chen has served as Director and Chief Financial Officer of Goldenstone since April 2021.



Mr. Liu has over 10 years of experience in mergers and acquisitions, including cross-border transactions involving the United States and China, which Mr. Liu actively participated in (in a variety capacities) from initial deal sourcing and negotiations through consummation. Mr. Chen also has over 10 years of extensive experience with mergers and acquisitions, especially with respect to target sourcing, deal structuring, and investment relations.




10







With a management team with experience in merger and acquisitions for blank check companies, connections to the Asian-American community in the United States, and experience in business development, we believe we can source attractive deals and find compelling investment opportunities from private and public sources to create value for shareholders. See the section titled “Management” for complete information on the experience of our officers and directors.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs and will allocate their time to other businesses, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We presently expect each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). As more fully discussed in “Management — Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under the British Virgin Islands law, prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Most of our officers and directors currently have certain pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations.



In addition, past performance by our management team is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. Furthermore, the members of the management team may not remain with us subsequent to the consummation of a business combination. 



Competitive Advantages



Experienced Management Team with Proven Track Record



Our management team has a proven track record of successful executing business combination and generating attractive return for investors as evidenced by the completion of business combination between Wealthbridge and Scienjoy in May 2020.



Together with our management team, we believe we have a broad network of contacts and corporate relationship that makes us efficient at:




● | Sourcing and evaluating businesses, and 
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Bridging cultural differences to negotiate and execute a transaction in a timely and professional manner. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





11







By leveraging our management team’s industry expertise, performing disciplined due diligence, being cautious downside protection, and providing post-acquisition value-add capabilities, we believe that we will be able to acquire a target business that will achieve significant returns for investors.



Status as a Publicly Listed Company



We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to prospective target businesses. As a publicly listed company, we will offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering. We believe that target businesses will favor this alternative, which we believe is less expensive, while offering greater certainty of execution than the traditional initial public offering. During an initial public offering, there are typically expenses incurred in marketing, which would be costlier than a business combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is approved by our shareholders (if applicable) and the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with shareholders’ interests than it would as a private company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented management staffs.
Strong Financial Position and Flexibility



With the funds held in our trust account, we can offer a target business a variety of options to facilitate a business combination and fund future expansion and growth of its business. Because we are able to consummate a business combination using the cash proceeds from this offering, our share capital, debt or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use an efficient structure allowing us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to address the needs of the parties. However, if a business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay for the purchase price, we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing.
Acquisition Strategy



Our acquisition strategy will seek to capitalize on M&A and operational expertise and relationship of both our management team and our board of directors, to identify attractive businesses that have capacity to grow rapidly by utilizing a public vehicle. Although we are not limited to any particular industry, we intend to primarily focus on companies operating in the Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) industry. There is no restriction in the geographic location of targets that we can pursue, although we intend to initially prioritize geographic locations in North America, as our officers and directors consist of successful entrepreneurs and senior executives with decades of operating and M&A experiences in the region.

AI has the potential to improve social productivity, bring disruptive changes to people’s production and life including lower labor cost, better products and services, new markets and more employment opportunities and is growing fully commercialized and bring profound changes to all industries. AI technologies have been deployed in financial, healthcare, security and a number of other areas, with widening application scenarios. It is an industry above all industries. Considering the growing impact of AI on social and economic development, US, Asia and European Union have released favorable policies to include AI into national strategies. 



Acquisition Criteria



The focus of our management team is to create shareholder value by leveraging its experience to improve the efficiency of the business while implementing strategies to grow revenue and profits organically and/or through acquisitions. Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating prospective businesses, we may deviate from these criteria and guidelines should we see fit to do so:

● | Niche Deal Size
--+----------------




We intend to acquire companies with enterprise values of between $150 million and $300 million that are preferably already cash-generative. We believe we have greater access to companies within this range and the negotiation process is generally less time consuming than companies that are much larger.




● | Long-term Revenue Visibility with Defensible Market Position 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------




We intend to seek target companies that are at an inflection point, such as those requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate by developing new products or services, or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance and where an acquisition may help facilitate growth.




● | Benefits from Being a U.S. Public Company (Value Creation and Marketing Opportunities) 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We intend to seek target companies that should offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our shareholders. We intend to seek to acquire a target on terms and in a manner that leverages our experience. We expect to evaluate financial returns based on (i) the potential for organic growth in cash flows, (ii) the ability to achieve cost savings, (iii) the ability to accelerate growth, including through the opportunity for follow-on acquisitions and (iv) the prospects for creating value through other value creation initiatives. Potential upside from growth in the target business’ earnings and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks.



These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.




13







Competitive Weaknesses



We believe our competitive weaknesses to be the following:



Limited Financial Resources



Our financial reserves will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of venture capital firms, leveraged buyout firms and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. In addition, our financial resources could be reduced because of our obligation to convert shares held by our public shareholders as well as any tender offer we conduct.



Lack of experience with blank check companies



Our management team is not experienced in pursuing business combinations on behalf of blank check companies. Other blank check companies may be sponsored and managed by individuals with prior experience in completing business combinations between blank check companies and target businesses. Our managements’ lack of experience may not be viewed favorably by target businesses.



Limited technical and human resources



As a blank check company, we have limited technical and human resources. Many venture capital funds, leveraged buyout firms and operating businesses possess greater technical and human resources than we do and thus we may be at a disadvantage when competing with them for target businesses.



Delay associated with shareholder approval or tender offer



We may be required to seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination. If we are not required to obtain shareholder approval of an initial business combination, we will allow our shareholders to sell their shares to us pursuant to a tender offer. Both seeking shareholder approval and conducting a tender offer will delay the consummation of our initial business combination. Other companies competing with us for acquisition opportunities may not be subject to similar requirement, or may be able to satisfy such requirements more quickly than we can. As a result, we may be at a disadvantage in competing for these opportunities.



Initial Business Combination with a Company Based in China or Hong Kong



Our initial business combination target company may include a company located in the PRC or Hong Kong. Because of such ties to China or Hong Kong, we are subjected to risks due to uncertainty of the interpretation and the application of the PRC laws and regulations, including but not limited to limitation on foreign ownership of certain industries and regulatory review of overseas listing of PRC companies through a special purpose vehicle and the validity and enforcement of the VIE agreements, if the PRC Target Company requires any of these legal requirements post business combination by us. Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership in certain industries, neither we nor our subsidiaries may own any direct equity interest in the PRC target company’s operating entity in a restricted industry (“Target Operating Entity”). Instead, we may conduct operations in China through a series of contractual arrangements with a VIE in China. Such contractual arrangements by and among PRC subsidiaries, the VIE, and the VIE’s shareholders may include (i) certain power of attorney agreements, a share pledge agreement and certain loan agreements; (ii) an exclusive business cooperation agreement which allows us to receive substantially all of the economic benefits from the VIE; and (iii) certain exclusive option agreements and certain spouse consent letters which provide us with an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in and/or assets of the VIE when and to the extent permitted by PRC laws (“VIE Structure”). The PRC Target Company, through contractual arrangements, can consolidate the financial results of the VIE in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS, if it has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.




14







These contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in respect of our relationship with the VIE. If the VIE or its shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, our recourse to the assets held by the VIE may be indirect and we may have to incur substantial costs and expend significant resources to enforce such arrangements in reliance on legal remedies under PRC law. These remedies may not always be effective, particularly in light of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of the relevant laws and regulations. Furthermore, in connection with litigation, arbitration or other judicial or dispute resolution proceedings, assets under the name of any of record holder of equity interest in the VIE, including such equity interest of such record holder, may be put under court custody. As a consequence, we cannot be certain that the equity interest will be disposed pursuant to the contractual arrangement or that the ownership by the record holder of such equity interest will be unchallenged. See “Risk Factors — Risks Associated with Acquiring and Operating a Target Business with its Primary Operation in China — If the PRC government deems that the contractual arrangements in relation to the potential PRC target company, the VIE, do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations.” In addition, if we acquire a target company that operates its business in the PRC through contractual arrangements, investors in our securities following a business combination would not hold equity interests in the VIE domiciled in China that is under our control and would instead hold equity interests in a British Virgin Islands holding company. You may never directly hold equity interests in PRC operating companies.



All of these contractual arrangements may be governed by and interpreted in accordance with PRC law, and disputes arising from these contractual arrangements may be resolved in court or through arbitration in China. Accordingly, these contracts will be interpreted in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes will be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal environment in the PRC is not as developed as in some other jurisdictions, such as the United States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce the contractual arrangements. As at the date of this annual report, there are very few precedents and little official guidance as to how contractual arrangements should be interpreted or enforced under PRC law. The contractual arrangements have not been widely tested in a court of law in the PRC and there remain significant uncertainties regarding the ultimate outcome of arbitration should legal action become necessary. In the event we are unable to enforce the contractual arrangements with the PRC target company or the VIE entity of the PRC target company post business combination, we may not be able to exercise the power to direct activities that most impact the economic performance, bears the risks of, and enjoys the rewards for the purpose of consolidating the financial results of the VIE in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS (as discussed above) and we may be precluded from operating the business, which will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the British Virgin Islands or the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state. For a description of the uncertainties of the VIE arrangements, see “Risk Factors — Risks Associated with Acquiring and Operating a Target Business with its Primary Operation in China.”



Transfers of Cash to and from our Potential VIE (Post Business Combination)



Goldenbridge Acquisition Limited is a holding company with no operations of its own. Our initial business combination target company may include a PRC Target Company which might require a VIE structure. As such, we may be required to conduct our operations in China primarily through our subsidiary and VIE in China. As a result, although other means are available for us to obtain financing at the holding company level, Goldenbridge Acquisition Limited’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders and to service any debt it may incur may depend upon dividends paid by our PRC Target Company’s subsidiaries. If any of our subsidiaries incurs debt on its own in the future, the instruments governing such debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends to Goldenbridge Acquisition Limited. In addition, our PRC Target Company’s subsidiaries and VIE are required to make appropriations to certain statutory reserve funds, which are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of a solvent liquidation of the companies.



Current PRC regulations permit the PRC Target Company’s indirect PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to an overseas subsidiary, for example a subsidiary located in Hong Kong, only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of the PRC Target Company’s subsidiaries in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Each of such entity in China is also required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund, although the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion of its board of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation.



The PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of Renminbi (“RMB”), the legal currency of the PRC, into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if the PRC target company’s subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If we or the PRC target company and its subsidiaries are unable to receive all of the revenues from their operations through the VIE agreements, we may be unable to pay dividends on our ordinary shares.




15







Cash dividends, if any, on our ordinary shares will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10.0%.



In order for us to pay dividends to our shareholders, we may rely on payments made from the VIE to the target’s PRC subsidiary, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (“WFOE”), pursuant to VIE agreements between them, and the distribution of such payments to our overseas subsidiary as dividends from thee WFOE. Certain payments from the VIE to WFOE are subject to PRC taxes, including business taxes and VAT.



Recent PCAOB Developments 



The PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections on accounting firms in the PRC or Hong Kong without the approval of the relevant government authorities. The auditor and its audit work in the PRC or Hong Kong may not be inspected fully by the PCAOB. Inspections of other auditors conducted by the PCAOB outside China have at times identified deficiencies in those auditors’ audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken in China or Hong Kong prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating the PRC auditor’s audits and its quality control procedures. As a result, shareholders may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections if we complete a business combination with such companies.



Future developments in U.S. laws may restrict our ability or willingness to complete certain business combinations with companies. For instance, the enacted Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“HFCAA”) could restrict our ability to consummate a business combination with a target business unless that business met certain standards of the PCAOB and would require delisting of a company from U.S. national securities exchanges if the PCAOB is unable to inspect its public accounting firm for three consecutive years. The HFCAA also requires public companies to disclose, among other things, whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government, specifically, those based in China. We may not be able to consummate a business combination with a favored target business due to these laws. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“AHFCAA”), which, if signed into law, would amend the HFCAA and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three consecutive years.



The documentation we may be required to submit to the SEC proving certain beneficial ownership requirements and establishing that we are not owned or controlled by a foreign government in the event that we use a foreign public accounting firm not subject to inspection by the PCAOB or where the PCAOB is unable to completely inspect or investigate our accounting practices or financial statements because of a position taken by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction could be onerous and time consuming to prepare. The HFCAA mandates the SEC to identify issuers of SEC-registered securities whose audited financial reports are prepared by an accounting firm that the PCAOB is unable to inspect due to restrictions imposed by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction where the audits are performed. If such identified issuer’s auditor cannot be inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive years, the trading of such issuer’s securities on any U.S. national securities exchanges, as well as any over-the-counter trading in the U.S., will be prohibited.



On March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCAA. An identified issuer will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies it as having a “non-inspection” year under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC.



On November 5, 2021, the SEC approved the PCAOB’s Rule 6100, Board Determinations Under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. Rule 6100 provides a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, as contemplated under the HFCAA, whether it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction.



On December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions.





16







On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in: (i) China, and (ii) Hong Kong. Our auditor, Friedman LLP, headquartered in New York, NY, is an independent registered public accounting firm with the PCAOB and has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis. The PCAOB currently has access to inspect the working papers of our auditor. Our auditor is not headquartered in China or Hong Kong and was not identified in this report as a firm subject to the PCAOB’s determination.



On August 26, 2022, the PCAOB entered into a Statement of Protocol with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance of the PRC and, as summarized in the “Statement on Agreement Governing Inspections and Investigations of Audit Firms Based in China and Hong Kong” published on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s official website, the parties agreed to the following: (i) in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the PCAOB shall have independent discretion to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation; (ii) the PCAOB shall have direct access to interview or take testimony from all personnel of the audit firms whose issuer engagements are being inspected or investigated; (iii) the PCAOB shall have the unfettered ability to transfer information to the SEC, in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and (iv) the PCAOB inspectors shall have access to complete audit work papers without any redactions, with view-only procedures for certain targeted pieces of information such as personally identifiable information. The PCAOB is required to reassess its determinations as to whether it is able to carry out inspection and investigation completely and without obstruction by the end of 2022.



In the event that we complete a business combination with a company with substantial operations in China and PCAOB is not able to fully conduct inspections of our auditor’s work papers in China, it could cause us to fail to be in compliance with U.S. securities laws and regulations, we could cease to be listed on a U.S. securities exchange, and U.S. trading of our shares could be prohibited under the HFCAA. Any of these actions, or uncertainties in the market about the possibility of such actions, could adversely affect our prospects to successfully complete a business combination with a China or Hong Kong-based company, our access to the U.S. capital markets and the price of our shares.



Future developments in respect of increased U.S. regulatory access to audit information are uncertain, as the legislative developments are subject to the legislative process and the regulatory developments are subject to the rule-making process and other administrative procedures.



For more detailed information, see “Risk Factors - Trading in our securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor. In that case, Nasdaq could delist our securities. The delisting of our securities, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment. Additionally, the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections may deprive our investors with the benefits of such inspections.”



Cash transfer through our organization



Goldenbridge Acquisition Limited is a newly organized blank check company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, entering into contractual arrangements, or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activities through June 30, 2022 relate to the Company’s formation and the Public Offering. Currently, we maintain our operating bank account in Hong Kong and obtain cash transfers from our Sponsor to fund and pay the offering expenses and daily operating activities, as needed. Cash transfers to and from our bank account are reflected within cash and cash equivalents, and we maintained $110,643 balance in cash and cash equivalents, as of June 30, 2022.



Up to June 30, 2022, we received the cumulative cash transfer of $1,150,000 from our Sponsor. No dividends or distribution have been made to date.


Effecting a Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business for an indefinite period of time following our IPO. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our IPO and the private placement of private units, our share capital, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of our IPO and the private placement of private units are intended to be applied generally toward effecting a business combination as described in this report, the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. Accordingly, investors in our IPO were investing without first having an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any one or more business combinations. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various U.S. Federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.

Selection of a Target Business



Subject to the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, we will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate. We have not established any other specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. To the extent we effect a business combination with a company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of early stage or potential emerging growth companies. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



Sources of Target Businesses



We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings which will not commence until after the completion of this offering. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this annual report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their respective affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. We may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will any of our existing officers, directors, special advisors or initial shareholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination (regardless of the type of transaction), except that Yongsheng Liu, our Chief Executive Officer will receive HK$50,000 (or approximately US$6,427 based on an exchange rate of HK$7.78 to US$1.00 on August 23, 2021) per month for his services to us. If we decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our officers, directors or initial shareholders, we will do so only if we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view. However, as of the date of this annual report, there is no affiliated entity that we consider a business combination target.



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination



Subject to the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any other specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:




● | financial condition and results of operation; 
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | growth potential;
--+------------------


● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capital requirements;
--+----------------------


● | competitive position;
--+----------------------


● | barriers to entry;
--+-------------------





18








● | stage of development of its products, processes or services; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other protection for its products, processes or services; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regulatory environment of the industry; and 
--+------------------------------------------------


● | costs associated with effecting the business combination. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------




We believe such factors will be important in evaluating prospective target businesses, regardless of the location or industry in which such target business operates. However, this list is not intended to be exhaustive. Furthermore, we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.



Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.



The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.



Fair Market Value of Target Business



Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. We anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, only the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test, assuming that we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on NASDAQ. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such fund raising arrangement and have no current intention of doing so. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold. 




19







We will not be required to comply with the 80% fair market value requirement if we are delisted from NASDAQ. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we would not be required to satisfy the fair market value requirement described above and could complete a business combination with a target business having a fair market value substantially below 80% of the balance in the trust account.



Lack of Business Diversification



Our business combination must be with a target business or businesses that collectively satisfy the minimum valuation standard at the time of such acquisition, as discussed above, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses at the same time. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.



Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management



Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.



Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination



In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each shareholder may tender any or all of his, her or its public shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction, or whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. If we so choose and we are legally permitted to do so, we have the flexibility to avoid a shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. 



We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted or sold to us) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait 21 months, or until December 4, 2022,in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.



Our initial shareholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, if we sought shareholder approval of a proposed transaction we could need as little as 56,251 of our public shares (or approximately 1.12% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved (assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised and the initial shareholders do not purchase any units in this offering or units or shares in the after-market).





21







If we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial shareholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.



Ability to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination



We initially had until March 4, 2022 to consummate our initial business combination. However, we have extended the period of time to consummate a business combination three (3) times, until December 4, 2022, after additional funds totaling $1,725,000 were deposited into the trust account. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, deposited into the trust account $575,000 ($0.10 per share in either case) for each three month extension, for the extension to December 4, 2022.



Conversion/Tender Rights



At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. The conversion rights will be effected under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and British Virgin Islands law as redemptions. If we hold a meeting to approve an initial business combination, a holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his shares.



Alternatively, if we engage in a tender offer, each public shareholder will be provided the opportunity to sell his public shares to us in such tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly, this is the minimum amount of time we would need to provide holders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company.



Our initial shareholders, officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to this offering or purchased by them in this offering or in the aftermarket.




22







We may also require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. Once the shares are converted by the holder, and effectively redeemed by us under British Virgin Islands law, the transfer agent will then update our Register of Members to reflect all conversions. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to shareholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we are required to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any shareholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a shareholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. As a result, if we require public shareholders who wish to convert their ordinary shares into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly, investors may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would not want to.



There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.



Any request to convert or tender such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).



If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders. 



Automatic Liquidation of Trust Account if No Business Combination



If we do not complete a business combination by December 4, 2022, it will trigger our automatic winding up, liquidation and subsequent dissolution pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. As a result, this has the same effect as if we had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under the Companies Law. Accordingly, no vote would be required from our shareholders to commence such a voluntary winding up, liquidation and subsequent dissolution. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, deposited into the trust account $575,000 for each three month extension, for the extension to December 4, 2022. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not necessary to pay our taxes, then seek to liquidate and dissolve. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public shareholders. In the event of our liquidation and subsequent dissolution, the public rights will expire and will be worthless. 




23







The amount in the trust account under the Companies Law will be treated as funds distributable under the Companies Law provided that immediately following the date on which the proposed distribution is proposed to be made, we are able to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. If we are forced to liquidate the trust account, we anticipate that we would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date (including any accrued interest). Prior to such distribution, we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation. Furthermore, while we will seek to have all vendors and service providers (which would include any third parties we engaged to assist us in any way in connection with our search for a target business) and prospective target businesses execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account or that a court would conclude that such agreements are legally enforceable.



Each of our initial shareholders and our officers and directors have agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation of our trust account or other assets with respect to the insider shares and private units and to vote their insider shares, private shares in favor of any liquidation and plan of distribution which we submit to a vote of shareholders. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants or rights, which will expire worthless.



If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of our IPO, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share distribution from the trust account would be $10.22. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would be prior to the claims of our public shareholders.



Although we have sought and will continue to seek to have all vendors, including lenders for money borrowed, prospective target businesses or other entities we engage execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refused to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, we would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to us if we chose not to engage such third party and evaluate if such engagement would be in the best interest of our shareholders if such third party refused to waive such claims. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. In any event, our management would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and would only enter into an agreement with a third party that did not execute a waiver if management believed that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason.



Cross Wealth Investment Holding Limited, which is owned by our director, Jining Li, has agreed that, if we liquidate the trust account prior to the consummation of a business combination, it will be liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us in excess of the net proceeds of our IPO not held in the trust account, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that such debts or obligations do not reduce the amounts in the trust account and only if such parties have not executed a waiver agreement. However, we cannot assure you that he will be able to satisfy those obligations if he is required to do so. Accordingly, the actual per-share distribution could be less than $10.22 due to claims of creditors.





24







We may redeem the outstanding warrants (excluding the private warrants and warrants underlying the units that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans but including any outstanding warrants issued upon exercise of the unit purchase option issued to Maxim Group LLC), in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per warrant:




● | at any time while the warrants are exercisable,
--+------------------------------------------------


● | upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | if, and only if, the last sales price of our ordinary shares equals or exceeds $16.50 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period ending three business days before we send the notice of redemption, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such warrants at the time of redemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until the date of redemption.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption, each warrant holder can exercise his, her or its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the ordinary shares may fall below the $16.50 trigger price as well as the $11.50 warrant exercise price per full share after the redemption notice is issued and not limit our ability to complete the redemption.



The redemption criteria for our warrants have been established at a price which is intended to provide warrant holders a reasonable premium to the initial exercise price and provide a sufficient differential between the then-prevailing share price and the warrant exercise price so that if the share price declines as a result of our redemption call, the redemption will not cause the share price to drop below the exercise price of the warrants.



If we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a “cashless basis.” In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the whole warrants for that number of ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the “fair market value” (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” shall mean the average reported last sale price of the ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. Whether we will exercise our option to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a “cashless basis” will depend on a variety of factors including the price of our ordinary shares at the time the warrants are called for redemption, our cash needs at such time and concerns regarding dilutive share issuances.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.



The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:




● | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a transaction;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.



If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.



Facilities



We maintain our principal executive office at 15/F, Aubin House, 171-172 Gloucester Road, Wanchai, Hong Kong. The cost for this space is provided to us by Golden Bridge Capital Limited, which is also owned by Mr. Jining Li, the Company’s director and also the affiliate of the sponsor, as part of the $10,000 per month payment we make to it for office space and related services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees



We have three executive officers, one of whom, Yongsheng Liu, our Chief Executive Officer, is also an employee. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once management locates a suitable target business to acquire, they will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time to our affairs) than they would prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
