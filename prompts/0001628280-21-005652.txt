Item 1. Business
Limbach Holdings, Inc. (the “Company,” “Limbach,” “we” or “our”), is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that was formed, on July 20, 2016, as a result of a business combination (“Business Combination”) with Limbach Holdings LLC (“LHLLC”).
The Company is an integrated building systems solutions firm whose expertise is in the design, modular prefabrication, installation, management and maintenance of heating, ventilation, air-conditioning (“HVAC”), mechanical, electrical, plumbing and controls systems. Across the United States, we provide comprehensive facility services consisting of mechanical construction, full HVAC service and maintenance, energy audits and retrofits, engineering and design build services, constructability evaluation, equipment and materials selection, offsite/prefab construction, and the complete range of sustainable building solutions and practices. Our primary customers include: (i) building owners themselves, for “owner-direct” work in which we contract directly with the building owners for both construction and maintenance services; and (ii) general contractors (“GCs”) and construction managers (“CMs”) who serve as the prime contractors in designing and constructing commercial buildings for public, institutional (not-for-profit) and private owners.
The Company operates in two segments, (i) Construction, in which we generally manage new construction or renovation projects that involve primarily HVAC, plumbing, or electrical services, and (ii) Service, in which we provide maintenance or services primarily on HVAC, plumbing, electrical systems, and building controls direct for building owners and direct specialty contracting projects.
Our core market sectors consist of the following:
•Healthcare, including research, acute care and inpatient hospitals for regional and national hospital groups, and pharmaceutical and biotech laboratories and manufacturing facilities;
•Education, including both public and private colleges, universities, research centers and K-12 facilities;
•Sports and entertainment, including sports arenas, entertainment facilities (including casinos) and amusement rides;
•Infrastructure, including passenger terminals and maintenance facilities for rail and airports;
•Government, including various facilities for federal, state and local agencies;
•Hospitality, including hotels and resorts;
•Commercial, including office building and other commercial structures;
•Multi-family apartments;
•Mission critical facilities, including data centers; and
•Industrial manufacturing facilities, including indoor grow farms.
We are particularly focused on expanding our top four sectors noted above (healthcare, education, mission critical facilities, and industrial manufacturing facilities), leveraging our core areas of expertise and targeting projects with optimal risk/reward characteristics. Our principal focus in coming years will be to accelerate the growth of our Service segment, which includes maintenance services, small projects, building controls installation and service, building environment management and performance services, and other project opportunities performed direct for building owners. In our Construction segment, our efforts are focused on improving project execution and profitability by pursuing opportunities that are smaller in size, shorter in duration, and where we can leverage our captive design and engineering services.
Our subsidiaries include Limbach Company LLC, which operates in New England, Eastern Pennsylvania, Western Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan and the Mid-Atlantic region which are the geographies in which we have entered into collective bargaining arrangements with various craft labor unions; Limbach Company LP, which operates in the Southern California region as a union operation; and Harper Limbach, a Florida-based subsidiary where we operate on a merit shop basis. Each of our operations provides design, construction and maintenance services in some or all of the HVAC, plumbing and electrical fields.
Our core growth strategies include offering design, construction and maintenance services for the full complement of HVAC, plumbing and electrical services in all of our branch operations. We currently offer certain of these services in each of our regions, with electrical self-perform design, installation and maintenance services being offered primarily in our Mid-Atlantic region. In addition, we also offer electrical services through installation subcontracting in our Ohio, Eastern Pennsylvania and Florida regions. Over the coming years, we plan to further equip each of our regions to provide a combined offering of mechanical construction and maintenance, and building system management services. We believe this combined offering is appealing to building owners who own and operate facilities with complex building systems. We also offer services to building owners known as MEP Prime, a service where we act as the general contractor on assignments that predominantly include a 
heavy concentration of mechanical HVAC, electrical, plumbing and building controls systems, along with other trades such as concrete and drywall, to offer a complete service package. 
We are also expanding our owner-direct offering to include other digital solutions to manage and monitor the performance of building systems, including data analytics, energy consumption and sustainability. These services allow us to develop new revenue streams leveraging our professional services capabilities, to support multi-location regional and national customers in core end-markets, and to drive energy retrofit and performance optimization projects for building owners. 
Complex systems lend themselves to delivery methodologies that fit our value proposition to our customers and integrated business model, including design/assist and design/build. We believe that few specialty contractors in the United States offer fully integrated HVAC, plumbing and electrical services. We believe our integrated approach provides a significant competitive advantage, especially when combined with our proprietary design and production software systems. Our integrated approach allows for increased prefabrication of HVAC components, improved cycle times for project delivery and reduced risks associated with onsite construction.
In 2020, we were ranked the 8th largest mechanical contractor according to information provided by Engineering News Record. 
For additional financial information about our operating segments, see Note 12 – Operating Segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Customers
Our customer base primarily consists of general contractors and construction managers, building owners and their representatives.
We believe we have strong relationships with many national commercial GC/CMs. As one of our core risk management processes, we are selective in choosing to work with GC/CMs that have similar core values to ours, have a solid payment history, have experienced and available project management labor, and who value our services and our reputation. Our top core national GC/CM customers include the following (listed in alphabetical order):
•Barton Malow
•Hensel Phelps Construction
•John Moriarty & Associates
•Robins & Morton
•PCL Construction Service
•The Christman Company
•Whiting-Turner
In addition to these national GC/CM customers, our branches also maintain strong relationships with local and regional GC/CMs that fit our selection criteria. We had a single Construction segment customer that accounted for approximately 14% of consolidated total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and a single Construction segment customer that accounted for approximately 10% of consolidated total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our strategic goals include continuing to grow our direct relationships with building owners. Building owners control capital and operating investments. This not only improves our position when entering into construction contracts with these owners, but also allows us to build long-term relationships around recurring maintenance services and smaller repair and installation projects, and positions us to deliver additional products and services in the future, including a digital offering. In our typical customer life cycle, we pursue opportunities to build or renovate facilities through a GC/CM. In most cases, this relationship is our primary point of entry into the building owner’s organization. However, we maintain hundreds of building owner relationships through our contracts for maintenance, smaller project renovations and energy retrofits. In our experience, when building owners are planning a project that involves predominantly HVAC, plumbing and/or electrical services, they often ask the GC/CM to assign the work directly to us. The following list includes some of our notable owner-direct relationships (listed in alphabetical order):
•Bay Care
•Beaumont Health System
•Cardinal Health
•Constellation Energy
•Disney’s Facility Group
•Disney’s Imagineering
•Honda
•Hospital Corporation of America
•Johns Hopkins University
•Marriott
•Ohio Health
•Ohio State University
•Orlando Health
•PPG Industries
•UHS
•Winterthur Museum
Construction Segment
Construction Delivery Methods
Our Construction revenue increased $2.8 million during 2020, reported at $441.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 up from $438.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross profit improved to 10.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 9.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019. We provide our Construction segment services through a variety of project delivery methodologies.
• Competitive Lump Sum Bidding (also referred to as “Plan & Spec” Bidding). Plan & Spec bidding is a competitive bid process among multiple contractors bidding on nearly complete or completed design documents based on a lump sum price for delivery of the project. Price is the predominant selection criteria in this process.
• Design/Assist. Design/Assist is a process in which a specialty contractor is selected among competing contractors using best value methodology. In best value, a selection is made based primarily upon qualifications and project approach, and secondarily on select cost factors. Cost factors are usually limited to a fixed fee and expense estimate and an estimate of the cost of work. With Design/Assist, the specialty contractor is typically contracted early in the design process to provide design and preconstruction input as needed to assist the customer in maintaining the established budget and completing design and drawings. This delivery option often includes a guaranteed maximum price (“GMP”) on a fixed fee basis; however, sometimes the owner may offer a lump sum price to be established following the completion of design. Typically, once the specialty contractor is selected, there is no further competition. In some cases, the owner has the option of holding a competitive process at the end of design. On occasion, an owner may arrange for a cost-plus fixed fee arrangement exclusive of a GMP or lump sum arrangement.
• Design/Build. Design/Build projects may be secured on a best value or qualification-based selection basis. A Design/Build contract may be delivered as a lump sum or GMP. With Design/Build, a prime GC/CM or other contractor will directly contract with a building owner. In many cases, the prime contractor will also procure specialty contracting services on a Design/Build lump sum or GMP basis. On occasion, we have the opportunity to provide Re-design/Build services. With Re-design/Build, we typically contract on a Design/Assist basis to participate during the design phase as described above. If the project’s HVAC, plumbing and/or electrical design is substantially over budget, then we may offer to re-design the project and bring the project back into budget. Higher margins may be earned on these contracts in comparison to Design/Assist contracts and can be executed with less risk due to having designed the systems.
• Performance Contracting. In select locations within specific market sectors (such as education), we provide performance contracting to building owners. Performance contracting involves the assessment of a building owner’s facilities and offers a proposal to reduce energy and operating costs over a specified period of time. Energy and operating savings are delivered through replacement of energy or cost inefficient systems and equipment with more efficient systems. Our performance contracting team is able to deliver the capital improvements using our Design/Build platform and then, in some instances, guarantee the energy and operating systems over an agreed upon time-frame. In most cases, the building owner provides the financing for performance contracting. In other cases, we arrange for third-party financing as part of the contract. Typically, performance contracts are offered on a negotiated basis. Negotiated contracts can provide for higher margins and lower risk than conventional projects. To assure our cost and operating saving guarantees, we require that we provide maintenance services during the term of the agreement.
Service Segment
Our key business initiatives for the Service Segment include the establishment of long-term relationships with building owners on a direct basis as compared to contracting with a GC/CM. We strive to convert construction projects into service business opportunities. We believe we have been successful in converting construction projects into long-term maintenance contracts with building owners. However, a large portion of our maintenance services are delivered to building owners for whom we 
have not performed construction services. Accordingly, our service platform can operate on a standalone basis or in conjunction with our construction platform. We believe that our maintenance service offering provides a distribution channel through which we can continue to deliver an expanded offering of value-added services direct to building owners that further reinforces our value proposition and differentiated capabilities. Our Service revenue grew by 10.5% to $127.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $115.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Service business includes multiple technical offerings, often delivered pursuant to renewable, evergreen contracts and provides the following revenue and gross profit streams:
• Maintenance Contracts. Through evergreen contracts, we provide maintenance services for HVAC, electrical and/or plumbing systems and equipment.
• Service Project Contracts. Smaller than typical construction projects, this work is contracted directly for a building owner. On projects that are predominantly HVAC, plumbing, and/or electrical in scope, we may act as the “prime” general contractor.
• Spot Work. “Spot” work is construction and/or service work performed on an emergency basis for building owners who are already under contract with us for maintenance and/or construction work.
• Automatic Temperature Controls (“ATC”). We provide design, installation and maintenance for specialized ATC systems through our maintenance and construction platforms to building owners and GC/CM customers.
• Special Projects Division (“SPD”). In addition to our major construction projects and our maintenance services, we provide construction services through our special project divisions, known as SPD. Each of our branch locations offers SPD services. SPD services are typically less than $1 million in construction cost and have short durations and limited scopes of work. These projects are primarily secured through lump sum competitive bids, though on occasion these projects may be negotiated. When design is required for an SPD project, Limbach Engineering & Design Services (“LEDS”) often supports the contract. Although SPD work is normally performed on projects under $1 million, the margins earned on these projects can be substantially higher than larger construction projects. Typically, the project duration for SPD services is shorter than that of large construction projects, and can sometimes be completed in less than 30 days.
• Energy Monitoring. Limbach's Energy Assessment for Performance (“LEAP”) program improves energy performance in buildings with a data-driven approach. LEAP's web-based energy management and sustainability software automatically tracks utility bills, updates key performance indicators like the Energy Star benchmarks and monitors energy use in real-time. On a routine schedule, professional engineers and certified energy managers provide expert analysis and coaching towards low and no-cost efficiency gains and discover longer-term opportunities to capture greater cost savings. 
Due to our successful contractual relationships with certain building owners earned through maintenance services, we are well positioned with those owners when they are ready to initiate major capital construction projects. As a result, our maintenance services often lead to and help drive and support the growth of our HVAC, plumbing and electrical construction business.
Engineering and Shared Services
Located in Orlando, Florida, LEDS provides captive engineering capabilities. LEDS provides professional engineering, energy analysis, estimation, and detail design services to building owners and clients in both our Construction and Service segments. This capability distinguishes us from competitors that more typically provide Design/Build services by hiring external engineering companies. By providing professional engineering through LEDS, we deliver integrated Design/Build services to the market. By bundling engineering services with construction, our clients avoid the costly expense of separate engineering services.
The core capability of LEDS is professional engineering. Combined throughout our business, we maintain eight registered professional engineers on staff, who are supported by a staff of approximately 35 estimators and designers. LEDS acts as the engineer of record for projects where we serve as a Design/Build specialty contractor. LEDS engineers have experience in healthcare, institutional, commercial, hospitality, and industrial projects. Our operations in all of our regions have complete access to a large staff of professional engineers and designers through LEDS. LEDS controls the development and maintenance of our Limbach Modeling and Production System (“LMPS”). LMPS is a comprehensive database, workflow, and reporting system used by LEDS and all of our branches to design, estimate, plan, and track construction projects. We believe LMPS is unique in the industry and provides a competitive advantage by providing highly technical services in-house in a cost effective manner. LMPS is a Building Information Modeling (“BIM”) tool that allows us to construct mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineering (“MEP”) systems in a virtual environment, avoid conflicts in the field, eliminate rework caused by coordination issues, maximize the use of off-site prefabrication of assemblies, and capture installation productivity and construction progress. We utilize LMPS beginning with the original engineering concept and throughout the construction 
process to continuously monitor progress and avoid wasted efforts. Many others in the industry expend additional costs to third parties for redrawing and remodeling effort to achieve the same results.
Backlog
We refer to our estimated revenue on uncompleted contracts, including the amount of revenue on contracts for which work has not begun, less the revenue we have recognized under such contracts, as “backlog.” Backlog includes unexercised contract options. Our backlog includes projects that have a written award, a letter of intent, a notice to proceed or an agreed upon work order to perform work on mutually accepted terms and conditions. Additionally, the difference between our backlog and remaining performance obligations is due to the portion of unexercised contract options that are excluded, under certain contract types, from our remaining performance obligations as these contracts can be canceled for convenience at any time by us or the customer without considerable cost incurred by the customer. Additional information related to our remaining performance obligations is provided in Note 17 — Remaining Performance Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our contract backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and could be an uncertain indicator of our future earnings.”
Our Construction backlog was $393.5 million and $504.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Projects are brought into backlog once we have been provided a written confirmation of award and the contract value has been established. At any point in time, we have a substantial volume of projects that are specifically identified and advanced in negotiations and/or documentation, however those projects are not booked as backlog until we have received written confirmation from the owner or the GC/CM of their intention to award us the contract and they have directed us to begin engineering, designing, incurring construction labor costs or procuring needed equipment and material. Our construction projects tend to be built over a 12- to 24-month schedule depending upon scope and complexity. Most major projects have a preconstruction planning phase which may require months of planning before actual construction commences. We are occasionally employed to deliver a “fast-track” project, where construction commences as the preconstruction planning work continues. As work on our projects progresses, we increase or decrease backlog to take into account our estimate of the effects of changes in estimated quantities, changes in conditions, change orders and other variations from initially anticipated contract revenues, and the percentage of completion of our work on the projects. Based on historical trends, we estimate that 65% of our construction backlog as of December 31, 2020 will be recognized as revenue during 2021. Additionally, the reduction in Construction backlog has been intentional as we look to focus on higher margin projects than historically, as well as our focus on smaller, higher margin owner direct projects.
Our Service backlog was $50.9 million and $57.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.  These amounts reflect unrecognized revenue expected to be recognized over the remaining terms of our service contracts and projects.  Based on historical trends, we estimate that 95% of our service backlog as of December 31, 2020 will be recognized as revenue during 2021. Additionally, we believe our Service backlog decreased due to lower sales in this segment in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020 because of macroeconomic uncertainty related to COVID-19.
Competition
The HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and maintenance industry is highly competitive and the geographic markets in which we compete have numerous companies that provide similar services. Factors influencing our competitiveness include price, reputation for quality, ability to reduce customer costs, experience and expertise, financial strength, surety bonding capacity, knowledge of local markets and conditions, availability and experience of craft labor, and customer relationships. Competitors tend to be regional firms that vary in size and depth of resources. There are, however, significant national competitors that have greater national presence and breadth of expertise than we do.
Materials & Equipment
We purchase materials, including sheet metal, steel and copper piping, electrical conduit, wire and other various materials from numerous sources. We also purchase equipment from various manufacturers. The price and availability of materials and equipment may vary from year to year due to market conditions and industry production capacities. We do not foresee a lack of availability of any materials or equipment in the near term.
Human Capital
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,700 employees, including approximately 500 full-time salaried employees, comprised of project managers, estimators, superintendents and engineers who manage crews in our construction business and 
office staff. We also had approximately 1,200 craft employees, some of whom are represented by various labor unions. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees. In most locations, we have developed strong partnerships with local unions to have access to an experienced, talented craft workforce.
Core Values and Core Purpose
From the technician in the field to the leadership of our company, we focus on caring for people. Our core purpose “is to create great opportunities for people”. We have implemented internal development programs, which allow us to attract and retain talent and emphasize the importance of promoting from within. We believe our core values reflect who we are. We care about our people and believe our approach provides a competitive advantage. We believe we have strong employee retention rates as a result of our ability to hire, develop and retain top industry talent.
Our culture is driven by our Core Values:
We CARE
We Strive for EXCELLENCE
We Act with INTEGRITY
We Are ACCOUNTABLE
We CARE, one of our Core Values, is the foundation of our efforts to create a diverse and inclusive organization. Building a culture where all of our employees feel a sense of belonging is important to us. Our diversity efforts began as a focus on Women in Construction and Service, which highlighted the opportunity to attract and grow the number of women in the industry. Currently, our Diversity and Inclusion Forum has a much broader reach and consists of leaders across the organization who seek to influence an evolving workforce and enhance recruitment, development and engagement strategies.
In addition, we screen leadership hires and measure employee performance against these Core Values, and regularly measure employee engagement against these values through our annual employee engagement survey. Our “We Care” survey, which has been issued for the past 15+ years, provides leadership with insights, including constructive ideas on how to improve the overall business for those who work for us.
Benefits & Wellness
We focus on the most crucial component for our success: our people. We appreciate the fact that we owe our century-old existence to employees who work hard to help us prosper.
As such, we have committed ourselves to the health, safety and well-being of our workers and their families. One of the ways we show our commitment is through a comprehensive benefits package, designed not only to cover our employees, but to give them a sense of security and support.
In addition, our Wellness Program consists of various activities and financial incentives intended to inspire our team towards healthy living through personal accountability. 
Safety Culture 
Our unique safety culture is based on its “Hearts and Minds Commitment to Safety” Program, established in 2013 by senior staff and field professionals via our Hearts and Minds Forum. This program helped earn our Ohio location, the highest honor for which Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) can name a company; OSHA-Voluntary Protection Programs Star Site. This was the first time a union mechanical contractor has earned such an honor in the United States. We strive to achieve this honor at our other locations. 
In the February 2020 issue of Safety+Health Magazine, our Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. Bacon, III, was recognized by the National Safety Council as one of nine CEOs who “Get It”. The safety culture is further evidenced throughout the country with awards from Disney, Turner Construction, Associated General Contractors, Builders Exchange, Mason Contractors Association of America, American Society of Safety Engineers, to name a few. “We Care” goes beyond a statement, it is the core of our culture. 
Seasonality
Severe weather can impact our operations. In the northern climates where we operate, and to a lesser extent the southern climates as well, severe winters can slow our productivity on construction projects, which shifts revenue and gross profit 
recognition to a later period. Our maintenance operations may also be impacted by mild or severe weather. Mild weather tends to reduce demand for our maintenance services, whereas severe weather may increase the demand for our maintenance and spot services.
Government and Environmental Regulations
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. We also are subject to compliance with numerous other laws and regulations of federal, state, local agencies, and authorities, including those relating to workplace safety, wage and hour, and other labor issues (including the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state laws), immigration controls, vehicle and equipment operations and other aspects of our business. In addition, a relatively limited number of our construction contracts are entered into with public authorities, and these contracts frequently impose additional requirements, including requirements regarding labor relations and subcontracting with designated classes of disadvantaged businesses. A large portion of our business uses labor that is provided under collective bargaining agreements. As such, we are subject to federal laws and regulations related to unionized labor and collective bargaining (including the National Labor Relations Act).
We continually monitor our compliance with these laws, regulations and other requirements. While compliance with existing laws, regulations and other requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, and we are not aware of any proposed requirements that we anticipate will have a material impact on our operations, there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change or that compliance will not otherwise adversely affect our operations in the future. In addition, while we typically pass any costs of compliance on to our customers under the applicable project agreement, either directly or as part of our estimate depending on the type of contract, there can be no assurance that we will not incur compliance expenses in the future that materially adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and other laws, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and comparable state laws, impose strict, retroactive, joint and several liability upon persons that contribute to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.
