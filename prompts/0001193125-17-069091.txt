 The Gorman-Rupp Company (Registrant, Gorman-Rupp or the Company) was incorporated in Ohio in 1934. The Company designs, manufactures and globally sells pumps and pump systems for use in water, wastewater, construction, dewatering, industrial, petroleum, original equipment, agriculture, fire protection, heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC), military and other liquid-handling applications. 
 PRODUCTS 
 The Company operates in one business segment, the manufacture and international sale of pumps and pump systems. The following table sets forth, for the years 2014 through 2016, the total net sales, income before income taxes and year-end total assets (in thousands) of the Company. 
 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | | 2014
Net sales | $ | 382,071 | | $ | 406,150 | | $ | 434,925
Income before taxes | | 36,482 | | | 37,266 | | | 53,734 
Total assets | | 382,818 | | | 364,201 | | | 380,904

 The Companys product line consists of pump models ranging in size from 1/4 to nearly 15 feet and ranging in rated capacity from less than one gallon per minute to nearly one million gallons per minute. The types of pumps which the Company produces include self-priming centrifugal, standard centrifugal, magnetic drive centrifugal, axial and mixed flow, vertical turbine line shaft, submersible, high pressure booster, rotary gear, diaphragm, bellows and oscillating. 
 The pumps have drives that range from 1/35 horsepower electric motors up to much larger electric motors or internal combustion engines capable of producing several thousand horsepower. Many of the larger units comprise encased, fully integrated water and wastewater pumping stations. In certain cases, units are designed for the inclusion of customer-supplied drives.

The Companys larger pumps are sold principally for use in the construction, industrial, water and wastewater handling fields; for flood control; for boosting low residential water pressure; for pumping refined petroleum products, including the ground refueling of aircraft; for fluid control in HVAC applications; and for various agricultural purposes. 
 The Companys pumps are also utilized for dewatering purposes. Additionally, pumps manufactured for fire protection are used for sprinkler back-up systems, fire hydrants, stand pipes, fog systems and deluge systems at hotels, banks, factories, airports, schools, public buildings and hundreds of other types of facilities throughout the world. 
 Many of the Companys smallest pumps are sold to customers for incorporation into such products as food processing, chemical processing, photo processing, medical and other waste treatment, HVAC equipment, appliances and solar heating. 
 MARKETING 
 The Companys pumps are marketed in the United States and worldwide through a network of more than 1,000 distributors, through manufacturers representatives (for sales to many original equipment manufacturers), through third-party distributor catalogs, and by direct sales. The Company regularly seeks alliances with distributors and other partners to further enhance marketing opportunities. Export sales are made primarily through foreign distributors and representatives. The Company has long-standing relationships with many of the leading independent distributors in the markets it serves and provides specialized training programs to distributors on a regular basis. 
 During 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were no shipments to any single customer that exceeded 10% of total net sales. Gorman-Rupp continued to actively pursue international business opportunities and, in 2016, shipped its pumps to approximately 140 countries around the world. No sales made to customers in any one foreign country amounted to more than 5% of total net sales during 2016, 2015 or 2014. 
 Approximately $131.2 million of 2016 sales were shipped outside the United States, as compared to $136.5 million in 2015 and $136.6 million in 2014. International sales represented 34% of total net sales in each of the years 2016 and 2015 and 31% of total net sales in 2014. See Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Business Segment Information. The Company continued its efforts to penetrate international markets principally by its increased global investments and its focus on meeting the worlds water and wastewater pumping needs. 
 COMPETITION 
 Since the late 1990s, a number of consolidations have occurred within the highly competitive pump industry. As a consequence, numerous pump competitors now exist as subsidiaries, divisions or departments within significantly larger corporations. Foreign-sourced pumps have also increasingly penetrated into most of the Companys domestic markets. 
 Gorman-Rupp estimates that approximately 80 other domestic and global companies selling pumps and pump units compete in one or more of the lines of business and applications in which comparable products of the Company are utilized. International competitors are based mostly in Europe and Asia. 
 Most commercial and industrial pumps are specifically designed and engineered for a particular customers application. The Company believes that proper application, product performance, and quality of delivery and service are its principal methods of competition, and attributes its success to its continued emphasis in these areas.

PURCHASING AND PRODUCTION 
 Substantially all of the materials, supplies, components and accessories used by the Company in the fabrication of its products, including all castings (for which most patterns are made and owned by the Company), structural steel, bar stock, motors, solenoids, engines, seals, and plastic and elastomeric components are purchased by the Company from other suppliers and manufacturers. No purchases are made under long-term contracts and the Company is not dependent upon a single source for any materials, supplies, components or accessories which are of material importance to its business. 
 The Company purchases motors for its polypropylene bellows pumps and magnetic drive pumps from several alternative vendors, while motor components for its large submersible pumps, and motors and engines for its pump systems, are purchased from a limited number of suppliers. Products requiring small motors are also sourced from alternative suppliers. 
 The other production operations of the Company consist of the machining of castings, the cutting, shaping and welding of bar stock and structural members, the design and assembly of electrical control panels, the manufacture of a few minor components, and the assembling, painting and testing of its products. Virtually all of the Companys products are tested prior to shipment. 
 OTHER ASPECTS 
 As of December 31, 2016, the Company employed approximately 1,180 persons, of whom approximately 680 were hourly employees. The Company has no collective bargaining agreements, has never experienced a work stoppage and considers its labor relations to be satisfactory. 
 Although the Company owns a number of patents, and several of them are important to its business, Gorman-Rupp believes that the business of the Company is not materially dependent upon any one or more patents. The Companys patents, trademarks and other intellectual property are adequate for its business purposes. 
 The backlog of orders at December 31, 2016 was $98.8 million compared to $117.1 million at December 31, 2015. Approximately 95% of the Companys backlog of unfilled orders is scheduled to be shipped during 2017, with the remainder principally during the first half of 2018. The decrease in backlog from 2015 is due primarily to approximately $9.9 million of shipments in 2016 for the Permanent Canal Closures & Pumps (PCCP) project to supply major flood control pumps to a member of a joint venture construction group for a significant New Orleans flood control project. Excluding the PCCP project in 2015 and 2016, the backlog at December 31, 2016 was down 7.9% as compared to December 31, 2015. In addition to the impact of PCCP, backlog has been impacted by lower orders in the petroleum and fire protection markets. Encouragingly, the municipal wastewater sector appears to be gaining momentum as incoming orders have increased in 2016 as compared to 2015.
