Item 1. Business
 
We operate a best-in-class technology platform empowering premium publishers who impact, inform, educate, and entertain. We operate a significant portion of the media businesses for Sports Illustrated (as defined below) and own and operate TheStreet, Inc. (the “TheStreet”), and power more than 250 independent brands including History, Maxim, Ski Magazine, and Biography. The Maven technology platform (the “Maven Platform”) provides digital publishing, distribution and monetization capabilities for the Sports Illustrated and TheStreet businesses as well as a coalition of independent, professionally managed online media publishers (each a “Channel Partner” or a “Maven”). Each Channel Partner joins the media-coalition by invitation-only and is drawn from premium media brands, professional journalists, subject matter experts, and social leaders. Mavens publish content and oversee an online community for their respective channels, leveraging our proprietary technology platform to engage the collective audiences within a single network. Generally, Mavens are independently owned, strategic partners who receive a share of revenue from the interaction with their content. When they join, we believe Mavens will benefit from the proprietary technology of the Maven Platform, techniques, and relationships. Advertising revenue may improve due to the scale we have achieved by combining all Mavens onto a single platform and the large and experienced sales organization. They may also benefit from our membership marketing and management systems, which we believe will enhance their revenue. Additionally, we believe the lead brand within each vertical creates a halo benefit for all Mavens in the vertical while each of them adds to the breadth and quality of content. While they benefit from these critical performance improvements they also may save substantially in costs of technology, infrastructure, advertising sales, and member marketing and management.

Corporate History
 
We were originally incorporated as Integrated Surgical Systems, Inc. (“Integrated”), in Delaware in 1990. On July 22, 2016 Amplify Media, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware and on July 27, 2016, it changed its name to Amplify Media Network, Inc. (“Amplify Media Network”). Amplify Media Network changed its name again on October 14, 2016 to TheMaven Network, Inc. (“TheMaven Network”).
 
On October 11, 2016, Integrated and TheMaven Network entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) whereby the stockholders of TheMaven Network agreed to exchange all of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock for shares of common stock of Integrated. On November 4, 2016, the parties consummated a recapitalization pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement and, as a result, TheMaven Network became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Integrated. Integrated changed its name to TheMaven, Inc. on December 2, 2016. On March 5, 2018, TheMaven Network changed its name to Maven Coalition, Inc. (“Maven Coalition 1”).

Acquisition of TheStreet, Inc. and Relationship with Cramer Digital
 
TheStreet became our wholly-owned subsidiary pursuant to that certain agreement and plan of merger, dated June 11, 2019, as amended (the “TheStreet Merger Agreement”), between us, Say Media, and TST Acquisition Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation (“TSTAC”), a newly-formed indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ours formed in order to facilitate the acquisition of TheStreet by us. Pursuant to TheStreet Merger Agreement, TSTAC merged with and into TheStreet, with TheStreet continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (the “TheStreet Merger”). On August 7, 2019, we acquired all the outstanding shares of TheStreet pursuant to the TheStreet Merger.
 
On August 7, 2019, in connection with the TheStreet Merger, we entered into a letter agreement (the “Original Cramer Agreement”) with finance and stock market expert Jim Cramer, who co-founded TheStreet, which sets forth the terms of the Cramer Services to be provided by Mr. Cramer and Cramer Digital, Inc. (“Cramer Digital”), a production company owned and controlled by Mr. Cramer, featuring the digital rights and content created by Mr. Cramer and his team of financial experts. A second letter agreement providing additional terms was entered into on April 16, 2020 (the “Second Cramer Agreement,” and together with the Original Cramer Agreement, the “Cramer Agreement”).
 
The Cramer Agreement provides for Mr. Cramer and Cramer Digital to create content for Maven on each business day during the term of the Cramer Agreement, prepare special content for us, make certain personal appearances and provide other services as reasonably requested and mutually agreed to (collectively, the “Cramer Services”). In consideration for the Cramer Services, we pay Cramer Digital a commission on subscription revenues and net advertising revenues for certain content (the “Revenue Share”). In addition, we pay Cramer Digital approximately $3,000,000 as an annualized guarantee payment in equal monthly draws, recoupable against the Revenue Share. We also issued two options to Cramer Digital pursuant to our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). The first option was to purchase up to two million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.72, the closing stock price on August 7, 2019, the grant date. This option vests over 36 months. The second option was to purchase up to three million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.54, the closing stock price on April 21, 2020, the grant date. In the event Cramer Digital and we agree to renew the term of the Cramer Agreement for a minimum of three years from the end of the second year of the current term, 900,000 shares will vest on the first day of the third year of the term as so extended (the “Trigger Date”). The remaining shares will vest equally on the 12-month anniversary of the Trigger Date, the 24-month anniversary of the Trigger Date and the 36-month anniversary of the Trigger Date.
 
In addition, we provide Cramer Digital with a marketing budget, access to personnel and support services, and production facilities. Finally, the Cramer Agreement provides that we will reimburse fifty percent of the cost of the rented office space by Cramer Digital, up to a maximum of $4,250 per month.

The Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement
 
On June 14, 2019, we entered into a licensing agreement (the “Initial Licensing Agreement”), as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Licensing Agreement, dated September 1, 2019 (the “First Amendment”), Amendment No. 2 to Licensing Agreement, dated April 1, 2020 (the “Second Amendment”), and Amendment No. 3 to Licensing Agreement, dated July 28, 2020 (the “Third Amendment” and, together with the Initial Licensing Agreement, First Amendment, and the Second Amendment, the “Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement”) with ABG-SI LLC (“ABG”), a Delaware limited liability company and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Authentic Brands Group, pursuant to which we have the exclusive right and license in the United States, Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand to operate the Sports Illustrated (“Sports Illustrated”) media business (in the English and Spanish languages), including to (i) operate the digital and print editions of Sports Illustrated (including all special interest issues and the swimsuit issue) and Sports Illustrated for Kids, (ii) develop new digital media channels under the Sports Illustrated brands and (iii) operate certain related businesses, including without limitation, special interest publications, video channels, bookazines and the licensing and/or syndication of certain products and content under the Sports Illustrated brand (collectively, the “Sports Illustrated Licensed Brands”).
 
The initial term of the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement commenced on October 4, 2019 upon the termination of the Meredith License Agreement (as defined below) and continues through December 31, 2029. We have the option, subject to certain conditions, to renew the term of the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement for nine consecutive renewal terms of 10 years each (collectively with the initial term, the “Term”), for a total of 100 years. The Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement provides that we will pay to ABG annual royalties in respect of each year of the Term based on gross revenues (“Royalties”) with guaranteed minimum annual amounts. On the execution of the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement, we prepaid ABG $45,000,000 against future royalties. ABG will pay to us a share of revenues relating to certain Sports Illustrated business lines not licensed to us, such as all gambling-related advertising and monetization, events, and commerce. The two companies are partnering in building the brand worldwide.
 
Pursuant to a publicly announced agreement, dated May 24, 2019, between ABG and Meredith Corporation (“Meredith”), an Iowa corporation, Meredith previously operated the Sports Illustrated Licensed Brands under license from ABG (the “Meredith License Agreement). On October 3, 2019, we, and Meredith entered into a Transition Services Agreement and an Outsourcing Agreement (collectively, the “Transition Agreement”), whereby the parties agreed to the terms and conditions under which Meredith continued to operate certain aspects of the business, and provided certain services during the fourth quarter of 2019 as all activities were transitioned over to us. Through these agreements, we took over operating control of the Sports Illustrated Licensed Brands, and the Transition Agreement was terminated.
 
Merger of Subsidiaries
 
On December 19, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Maven Coalition 1 and HubPages, were merged into another of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Say Media. On January 6, 2020, Say Media changed its name to Maven Coalition, Inc. (the “Maven Coalition”).
Asset Acquisition of Petametrics Inc.
 
On March 9, 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Petametrics Inc., doing business as LiftIgniter, a Delaware corporation (“LiftIgniter”), and Maven Coalition, whereby Maven Coalition purchased substantially all the assets of LiftIgniter’s machine learning platform, which personalizes content and product recommendations in real-time. The purchased assets included LiftIgniter’s intellectual property and excluded certain accounts receivable. Maven Coalition also assumed certain of LiftIgniter’s liabilities. The purchase price consisted of: (i) a cash payment of $184,086 on February 19, 2020, in connection with the repayment of certain of its outstanding indebtedness; (ii) a cash payment at closing of $131,202; (iii) collections of certain accounts receivable; (iv) on the first anniversary date of the closing issuance of restricted stock units for an aggregate of up to 312,500 shares of our common stock; and (v) on the second anniversary date of the closing issuance of restricted stock units for an aggregate of up to 312,500 shares of our common stock.

Recapitalization Accounting
 
On October 11, 2016, Integrated and TheMaven Network entered into the Share Exchange Agreement that provided for each outstanding share of common stock of TheMaven Network to be converted into 4.13607 shares of our common stock (the “Exchange Ratio”), and for each outstanding warrant and stock option to purchase shares of common stock of TheMaven Network be cancelled in exchange for a warrant or stock option to purchase shares of our common stock based on the Exchange Ratio (the “Recapitalization”).

Existing stock options to purchase 175,000 shares of our common stock were assumed pursuant to the Recapitalization.
 
Business and Technology
 
We have developed a proprietary online publishing platform that provides Channel Partners the ability to produce and manage editorially focused content and community interaction through tools and services provided by us. We have also developed proprietary advertising technology, techniques, and relationships that allow our Channel Partners to monetize online editorially focused content through various display and custom content advertising solutions and services (the “Advertising Solutions” and, together with the Maven Platform, the “Maven Platform Services”).
 
The Maven Platform launched in “preview” form in May 2017 when the first channels went live and has been substantially enhanced with ongoing development and the integration of three other platform acquisitions. We have incorporated state-of-the-art mobile, video, communications, social, notifications, and other technology into the Maven Platform, including modern DevOps processes with continuous integration/continuous deployment and an entirely cloud-based back-end. The software engineering and product development teams are experienced at delivering service at scale. We continue to develop the Maven Platform software by combining proprietary code with components from the open-source community, plus select commercial services as well as identifying, acquiring and integrating other platform technologies, where we see unique long-term benefits to us.

In connection with providing the Maven Platform Services, we enter into contracts with advertising networks to serve display or video advertisements on the digital media pages associated with its various channels. We also enter into contracts with internet users that subscribe to premium content on the digital media channels. These contracts provide internet users with a membership subscription (each, a “Membership”) to access the premium content for a given period of time, which is generally one year.
 
Our Channel Partners use the Maven Platform Services to produce, manage, host, and monetize their content in accordance with the terms and conditions between partner agreements between each of our Channel Partners and us (the “Partnership Agreements”). Pursuant to the Partnership Agreements, we and our Channel Partners split revenue generated from the Maven Platform Services used in connection with our Channel Partner’s content based on certain metrics such as whether the revenue was from direct sales, whether revenue was generated by our Channel Partner or us, whether the revenue was generated in connection with a Membership, whether based on standalone or bundled subscriptions, and whether the revenue was derived from affiliate links.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of each Partnership Agreement and in exchange for the Maven Platform Services, our Channel Partners grant us, for so long as our Channel Partner’s assets are hosted on the Maven Platform, (i) exclusive control of ads.txt with respect to our Channel Partner’s domains and (ii) the exclusive right to include our Channel Partner’s website domains and related URLs in our network in a consolidated listing assembled by third party measurement companies such as comScore, Nielsen, and/or other similar measuring services selected by us. As such, the Maven Platform serves as the primary digital media and social platform with respect to each of our Channel Partners’ website domains during the applicable term of each Partnership Agreement.
 
Our Brands and Growth Strategy
 
Our growth strategy is to continue to expand the coalition by adding new Mavens in key verticals that management believes will expand the scale of unique users interacting on the Maven Platform. In each vertical, we seek to build around a leading brand, such as Sports Illustrated (for sports) and TheStreet (for finance), surround it with subcategory Maven specialists, and further enhance coverage with individual expert contributors. The primary means of expansion is adding independent Mavens and/or acquiring publishers that have premium branded content and can broaden the reach and impact of the Maven Platform.
Maven
 
We operate a best-in-class technology platform empowering premium publishers who impact, inform, educate, and entertain. We operate the media businesses for Sports Illustrated and TheStreet, and power more than 250 independent brands including History, Maxim, and Biography. These brands range from individual thought-leaders to world-leading independent publishers, operating on the Maven Platform, a shared digital publishing, monetization and distribution platform.
Sports Illustrated
 
We assumed management of the Sports Illustrated media assets (pursuant to the Sports Illustrated License Agreement) on October 4, 2019. Sports Illustrated is owned by ABG, a brand development, marketing, and entertainment company that owns a global portfolio of media, entertainment, and lifestyle brands. Since assuming management of the Sports Illustrated media assets, we have implemented significant changes to rebuild the historic brand and beacon of sports journalism, to evolve the business and to position it for growth and continued success going forward.
 
TheStreet and Cramer Digital
 
TheStreet is a leading financial news and information provider to investors and institutions worldwide and has produced business news and market analysis for individual investors for more than 20 years. TheStreet brings its editorial tradition, strong subscription platform and valuable membership base to us, and benefits from our mobile-friendly CMS, social, video, and monetization technology.

We acquired HubPages to enhance the user’s experience by increasing content. HubPages operates a network of 27 premium content channels that act as an open community for writers, explorers, knowledge seekers, and conversation starters to connect in an interactive and informative online space. HubPages operates in the United States.
 
Say Media
 
We acquired Say Media to enhance the user’s experience by increasing content. Say Media operates a comprehensive online media publishing platform and enables brand advertisers to engage today’s social media consumer through rich advertising experiences across its network of web properties. Say Media operates in the United States and has subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.

Aided by machine-learning technology, publishers can identify and target those interested in their content.

Intellectual Property
 
We have seven patent registrations in the United States in connection with our technology. All of our patent registrations are owned by Maven Coalition, Inc.
 
Maven and Key Design
 
We currently have trademark registrations directed to our primary key design logo and the MAVEN name in the United States, Australia, China, the European Union, India, and New Zealand, as well as international Madrid Protocol registrations. We have trademark applications directed to our primary key design logo and the MAVEN name pending in Japan and Canada.
 
Moreover, we have a U.S. trademark registration for the word mark MAVEN COALITION, a European Union trademark registration for the word mark THEMAVEN, and a U.S. trademark registration for the word mark A MAVEN CHANNEL. We have trademark applications for the word mark A MAVEN CHANNEL pending in Australia, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and New Zealand, as well as a pending international Madrid Protocol application.
 
We have a trademark registration for the word mark BULL MARKET FANTASY in the United States and a trademark application for BULL MARKET FANTASY pending in Canada. We have trademark applications for the word marks SPORTSLIGHTNING and STREETLIGHTNING pending in the United States.

HubPages
 
We have trademark registrations for the word mark HUBPAGES in the United States, Australia, China, the European Union, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, India, Peru, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico and the Philippines, as well as an international Madrid Protocol registration.
 
We continue to file updated trademark applications to reflect our branding evolution and intend to continue strengthening our trademark portfolio as financial resources permit.
 
Our Channel Partners and Licensing
 
In connection with our Partnership Agreements and any other applicable agreements between us and our Channel Partners, (i) we and our affiliates own and retain (a) all right, title, and interest in and to the Maven Platform, Advertising Solutions, and data collected by us, and (b) we and our licensors’ trademarks and branding and all software and technology we use to provide and operate the Maven Platform and Advertising Solutions, and (ii) each Channel Partner owns and retains (a) all right, title, and interest in and to the Channel Partner’s assets, content, and data collected by Channel Partner and (b) each Channel Partner’s trademarks and branding.
Seasonality
 
We expect to experience typical media company advertising and membership sales seasonality, which is strong in the fiscal fourth quarter and slower in the fiscal first quarter.
Competition
 
Currently we believe that there are dozens of competitors delivering niche media content on the web and on mobile devices and an even broader array of general media companies and major media brands. All those competitors use mobile alerts, invest heavily in video, and leverage social media. We believe that we have developed distribution, production, and technology tactics that are superior because our management team’s tactics in the past with prior companies have proven to be highly engaging and effective for our particular model, which organizes channels into interest groups, led by key brands, such as Sports Illustrated in the sports vertical and TheStreet.com in the finance vertical.

11
--


The web provides unlimited access to the market by niche or general media companies, so there are a large number and variety of direct competitors of ours competing for audience and ad and membership dollars. The general business of online media, combined with some level or method of leveraging community attracts many potential entrants, and in the future, there may be strong competitors that will compete with us in general or in selected markets. These and other companies may be better financed and be able to develop their markets more quickly and penetrate those market more effectively. The following is a list of possible competitors and their respective categories:
 

● | Vice, Buzzfeed, Business Insider et al – niche content, leveraging social, mobile and video, competing for ad dollars; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Fortune, CNN, ESPN, Yahoo!, Google, et al – general content, major media companies, competing for ad dollars; 
● | WordPress, Medium, RebelMouse, Arc – content management software, open to all including experts and professionals, competing for publishers; 
● | YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit – social platforms open to all including experts and professionals; and 
● | Affiliate networks such as Liberty Alliance – competing for ad dollars. 

 
We believe that we compete on the basis of our technology, substantial scale in traffic, ease of use, recognized lead media brands, and platform evolution through a continuing development and acquisition program. We believe that our scale, methods, technology, and experience enable us to compete for a material amount of market share of media dollars and membership revenue.
 
Government Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state laws and regulations that involve privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, or other subjects. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate.

12

A number of government authorities, both in the United States and abroad, and private parties are increasing their focus on privacy issues and the use of personal information. All states have enacted some form of data privacy legislation, including data security and breach notification laws in all 50 states, and some form of regulation regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information at the federal level and in several states. California has been the most active in the area of consumer privacy legislation, including passing a comprehensive law requiring transparency, access, and choice known as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which was amended in November 2020 by a ballot measure known as the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”).The CCPA went into effect January 1, 2020, with enforcement having begun in June 2020. The CPRA goes into effect over time, with enforcement to begin July 2023. Other states are also considering comprehensive consumer privacy legislation. Certain states have also enacted legislation requiring certain encryption technologies for the storage and transmission of personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and more states are considering laws for or have enacted laws about information security, which may require the adoption of written information security policies that are consistent with state laws if businesses have personal information of residents of those states. Data privacy and information security legislation is also being considered at the federal level, concerning the privacy of individuals and use of internet and marketing information. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and attorneys general in several states have oversight of business operations concerning the use of personal information and breaches of the privacy laws under existing consumer protection laws. In particular, an attorney general or the FTC may examine privacy policies to ensure that a company discloses all material practices and fully complies with representations in the policies regarding the manner in which the information provided by consumers and other visitors to a website is used and disclosed by it, and the failure to do so could give rise to a complaint under state or federal unfair competition or consumer protection laws. The California Attorney General has begun aggressively investigating companies, especially those with websites, with respect to CCPA compliance and these investigations reportedly include inquiries into issues for which there has not yet been clear guidance issued by the state, such as regarding third party cookies that collect personal information from users when they visit our and other websites.
 
We review our privacy policies and overall operations on a regular basis to ensure compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state laws, and to the extent applicable, any foreign laws. We launched a CCPA compliance program in January 2020 and at the end of 2020 reviewed the program and made adjustments to our privacy notice and compliance program practices to account for our evolving practices and the new CCPA regulations, which were promulgated in July 2020 and continue to be subject to ongoing rulemaking. We believe the position we take regarding various CCPA issues, including third party cookies, is based on sound and good faith interpretations of the law based on consultation with legal counsel. However, there are conflicting interpretations of the law that have been adopted by various parties in the digital media industry, and given the lack of guidance to date on many of these issues, our compliance posture on some issues might not be accepted by the State of California.
 
In addition to the laws of the United States, we may be subject to foreign laws regulating web sites and online services, and the laws in some jurisdictions outside of the United States are stricter than the laws in the United States. For instance, in May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) went into effect in the European Union (the “EU”) and European Economic Area and Switzerland. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that include significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some EU countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing additional data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of personal data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. How the GDPR will be fully applied to online services, including cookies and digital advertising, is still being determined through ongoing rulemaking and evolving interpretation by applicable authorities. We operate a GDPR compliance program that we believe, based on our good faith interpretation of the GDPR in consultation with counsel, is consistent with our obligations under that law. The highest court in the EU recently ruled that the US/EU Privacy Shield was inadequate under GDPR and questioned the viability or legality of any EU to U.S. personal data transfer methods. We are working to address this issue, for instance, including standard contractual clauses as part of our Data Processing Agreements, and we continue to monitor the development of EU to U.S. personal data transfer methods and the law relating thereto.
 
Social networking websites are under increasing scrutiny. Legislation has been introduced on the state and federal level that could regulate social networking websites. Some rules call for more stringent age-verification techniques, attempt to mandate data retention or data destruction by Internet providers, and impose civil and/or criminal penalties on owners or operators of social networking websites.

The FTC regularly considers issues relating to online behavioral advertising (a/k/a interest-based advertising), which is a significant revenue source for us, and Congress and state legislatures are frequently asked to regulate this type of advertising, including requiring consumers to provide express consent for tracking purposes, so that advertisers may know their interests and are, therefore, able to serve them more relevant, targeted ads. Targeted ads generate higher per impression fees than non-targeted ads. New laws, or new interpretations of existing laws, could potentially place restrictions on our ability to utilize our database and other marketing data (e.g., from third parties) on our own behalf and on behalf of our advertising clients, which may adversely affect our business.
 
Legislation concerning the above described online activities has either been enacted or is in various stages of development and implementation in other countries around the world and could affect our ability to make our websites available in those countries as future legislation is made effective. It is possible that state and foreign governments might also attempt to regulate our transmissions of content on our website or prosecute us for violations of their laws. U.S. law offers limited safe harbors and immunities to publishers for certain liability arising out of user-posted content, but other countries do not. Further, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, and internationally, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties and liability for defamation or other claims arising out of user-posted content. Our business could be negatively impacted if applicable laws subject us to greater regulation or risk of liability.
 
Our business could also be adversely affected if regulatory enforcement authorities, such as the California Attorney General or EU/EEA data protection authorities, take issue with any of our approaches to compliance, or if new laws, regulations or decisions regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and/or disclosure of personal information are implemented in such ways that impose new or additional technology requirements on us, limit our ability to collect, transmit, store and use or disclose the information, or if government authorities or private parties challenge our data privacy and/or security practices that result in liability to, or restrictions, on us, or we experience a significant data or information breach which would require public disclosure under existing notification laws and for which we may be liable for damages and/or penalties.
 
Furthermore, governments of applicable jurisdictions might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities even though we do not have a physical presence and/or operate in those jurisdictions. As our platforms, products and advertisement activities are available over the Internet anywhere in the world, multiple jurisdictions may claim that we are required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each of those jurisdictions and pay various taxes in those jurisdictions. We address state and local jurisdictions where we believe we have nexus, however, there can be no assurance that we have complied with all jurisdictions that may assert that we owe taxes.
