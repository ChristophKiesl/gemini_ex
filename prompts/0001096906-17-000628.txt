 ITEM 1.  Business
 Overview
 Dynatronics Corporation designs, manufactures and distributes advanced-technology medical devices, therapeutic and medical treatment tables, rehabilitation equipment, custom athletic training treatment tables and equipment, institutional cabinetry as well as other rehabilitation and therapy products and supplies. Through our various distribution channels, we market and sell our products to physical therapists, chiropractors, athletic trainers, sports medicine practitioners, and other medical professionals and institutions. We offer customers a one-stop shop for their medical equipment and supply needs, including electrotherapy, therapeutic ultrasound, phototherapy, rehabilitation products and supplies, treatment tables, customized training room products and exercise products.
 Our business is conducted through our legacy operations at our headquarters facility in Cottonwood Heights, Utah, in the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, and in subsidiary operations in Chattanooga, Tennessee and Northvale, New Jersey.  Dynatronics was founded on a technology platform to treat patients non-invasively using microprocessor-based therapeutic devices. Over the past 35+ years, we have grown our business and product offerings by building upon these core therapeutic technologies, acquiring businesses in related medical fields, including our recent acquisition of the assets of Hausmann Industries during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, and developing products and distribution to further meet the needs of our target customers.
 On April 3, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Hausmann Industries, Inc. in Northvale, New Jersey, a suburb of New York City ("Hausmann"). Hausmann was a privately held manufacturer of medical, therapy, and athletic training equipment founded in 1955. The acquisition expanded our capital equipment product offerings and manufacturing capacity, and is expected to add approximately $15 million in annual sales to Dynatronics' operations.
 Vision
 We aspire to become a global leader in providing therapeutic equipment and physical medicine technology that helps medical professionals treat their patients effectively and non-invasively, while at the same time, providing a high quality investment for shareholders. We believe we will achieve these goals by evaluating and pursuing the best business combinations, strengthening our brand and generally becoming a top player in the markets in which we compete.

Strategy
 We are focusing on three ways to increase growth: (1) introducing new and improved products to the market; (2) expanding geographically and improving market penetration; and (3) making strategic acquisitions.
 Our executive leadership team has established the following near-term objectives aimed at implementing this strategy.
 Product Development and Improvement. We are investing in product development to improve current products and to create a pipeline of innovative solutions. Consistent with our competitive advantage as a manufacturer, we focus our development on therapeutic technologies and related products that have the potential for timely and material returns on investment. We also seek innovative technologies to license that help to broaden and complete our product offerings.
 Geographic Expansion and Market Penetration. We see opportunity to continue our organic growth by expanding our U.S. geographic presence and improving our market penetration through the addition of direct sales reps in key markets and expansion of dealer distribution nationally. Part of that dealer expansion is leveraging the relationships that Hausmann Industries has established with key dealers and introducing them to the broad line of products offered by Dynatronics. We also continue to explore possibilities for expansion internationally which presently accounts for less than 5% of our sales.  Our market strengths continue to be in physical therapy as well as athletic training/sports medicine. The recent Hausmann acquisition has significantly strengthened our presence in both of these markets. This year we have increased our presence in the post-acute care market characterized by rehab hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and nursing homes. We will continue to drive growth in these markets through execution of our strategic plans.
 Strategic Acquisitions. In the past decade, we have acquired businesses to expand our operations and strengthen our market position. In fiscal 2017 we successfully acquired and integrated the assets of Hausmann. Our business development program will continue to be an important part of our strategy to increase scale. We intend to pursue acquisitions to expand product offerings, strengthen domestic or international distribution, add technologies, increase the scale of one of our current portfolios, and/or provide access to complementary or strategic growth areas.

Recent Developments
 Acquisition of Bird & Cronin, Inc.
 On September 26, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") to acquire substantially all of the assets of Bird & Cronin, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("B&C"), for $14.5 million to $15.5 million in cash and securities, subject to adjustment, as provided in the Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Acquisition"). We will fund the Acquisition with proceeds from the private placement of our Series C 6% Convertible Non-Voting Preferred Stock (the "Private Placement") and borrowings under a commitment to modify an asset-based lending facility that the Company has in place with Bank of the West (the "Amended Credit Facility"). B&C designs and manufactures orthopedic soft goods and medical supplies which it sells and distributes in the United States and internationally under its own brands and under private-label manufacturing agreements.
 Asset Purchase Agreement. Closing of the Acquisition is expected to occur on or about October 2, 2017, concurrent with the closing of the Private Placement and funding of the Amended Credit Facility. At the Closing, we will acquire substantially all of the assets of B&C and following the Closing we will operate the business formerly conducted by B&C at its Minneapolis, Minnesota facility, which is owned by an affiliate of the principal shareholder of B&C. We will lease the facility on terms contained in a lease agreement (the "Lease") with an initial three-year term, with annual lease payments of $600,000.

The purchase price for B&C is an amount not to exceed $15.5 million and no less than $14.5 million, payable in cash of $10.5 million and shares of the Company's Series D 6% Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series D Preferred") valued at $4.0 million (as provided in the Asset Purchase Agreement), with a potential for an additional $1.0 million earn-out based on revenues of the business during the two-year period following the closing of the Acquisition. We will hold back $1.4 million of the purchase price for purposes of satisfying adjustments to the purchase price as may be required by the Asset Purchase Agreement and indemnification claims, if any. Subject to adjustments or claims as provided by the Asset Purchase Agreement, 50% of the holdback amount will be released to B&C on the first anniversary date of the closing of the Acquisition; the balance of this holdback amount will be released to B&C 18 months after Closing. As part of the Acquisition transaction, we will pay and discharge certain liabilities and obligations of B&C related to its ongoing business (primarily trade accounts and similar obligations in the ordinary course). Each share of Series D Preferred is convertible into one share of common stock of the Company automatically upon, but not before receipt of shareholder approval as described below under the heading "Conversion of Series C and Series D Preferred Stock."

We will make offers of employment to employees of B&C to become Dynatronics employees at Closing. The Company has also entered into employment agreements with the co-presidents of B&C, Michael Cronin and Jason Anderson, who will act in the same positions with the wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Company that will act as assignee of Dynatronics at closing and become the operating entity thereafter. Under these agreements, we will pay each of Messrs. Cronin and Anderson an annual salary of $175,000, a bonus up to $10,000 as determined by our CEO, Mr. Cullimore, and other employee benefits provided to our employees generally at their level of management at the Minnesota location (including, e.g., paid time off and paid holidays, medical/dental/vision insurance, Section 125 Flexible Spending Account (FSA), and 401(k)).  Additionally, Mr. Anderson and Mr. Cronin are each subject to restrictive covenants not compete with the Company for a period of two years and one year, respectively, after termination of their employment with the company.
 The Asset Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by B&C and the Company, as well as customary indemnification provisions among the parties. Post-closing covenants include a covenant that for a period of five years (the "Restrictive Period"), B&C and its shareholders (including Mr. Cronin as a beneficial owner of B&C) will refrain from solicitation of employees, customers and business of B&C or the Company and from other competitive activity as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement, and requires them and their representatives (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) to maintain (other than in connection with performing obligations pursuant to the Lease or the Employment Agreements, as applicable) the confidentiality of, and not use, confidential information relating to the acquired business or purchased assets, except as permitted by the Asset Purchase Agreement.

We will file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Asset Purchase Agreement, Financial Statements and other documents as exhibits, containing a more complete description of the Acquisition and the related transactions. The foregoing description of the Asset Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Asset Purchase Agreement.
 
The Amended Credit Facility. On September 25, 2017, we obtained a commitment letter for an amended loan and security agreement and related documentation to amend our credit facility with Bank of the West ("Bank") to provide asset-based financing to the Company to be used for funding the Acquisition and for operating capital (the "Amended Credit Facility"). Amounts available to us under the Amended Credit Facility will be subject to a borrowing base calculation of up to a maximum availability of $11,000,000 and will bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%. We will pay a line increase fee of $7,500 and an unused line fee of .25%. The maturity date is two years from the date of the note. The borrowing base is computed as an amount equal to 80% of eligible accounts receivable, 48% of finished goods inventory, and 15% of raw materials inventory.

 The Amended Credit Facility is subject to documentation (including a loan and security agreement, financing statements, notes and other agreements) and the obligations of the Company will be secured by first priority liens on substantially all of the Company's and its subsidiaries' assets (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility). The Amended Credit Facility includes financial covenants, such as ratios for consolidated leverage and fixed charge coverage, and customary affirmative and negative covenants for a transaction of this type, including, among others, the provision of annual, quarterly and monthly financial statements and compliance certificates, maintenance of property, insurance, compliance with laws and environmental matters, restrictions on incurrence of indebtedness, granting of liens, making investments and acquisitions, paying dividends, entering into affiliate transactions and asset sales. The Amended Credit Facility also contains penalties in connection with customary events of default, including, among others, payment, bankruptcy, representation and warranty, covenant, change in control, judgment and events or conditions that have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility).

The foregoing description of the Amended Credit Facility does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the loan and security agreement and related documents, which will be filed as exhibits to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, to be filed in connection with the Acquisition.
 
Securities Purchase Agreement. In connection with the Acquisition, we initiated a private offering of our equity securities to raise up to $7.0 million (the "Private Placement"). Closing of the Private Placement under the Securities Purchase Agreement will occur simultaneously with the Closing of the Acquisition. In the Private Placement, we offered and sold shares of the Company's Series C 6% Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series C Preferred") and common stock purchase warrants to a limited number of accredited investors (the "Investors") pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Securities Purchase Agreement.

 The Series C Preferred and the warrants and the underlying common stock are offered and will be issued in reliance upon exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), including the exemptions under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder, relating to offers and sales by an issuer not involving any public offering, and in reliance on similar exemptions under applicable state laws. Each purchaser represented that it is an accredited investor and that it is acquiring the securities for investment purposes only and not with a view to any resale, distribution or other disposition of such securities in violation of the United States federal securities laws. Securities issued in the Private Placement are "restricted securities" under the Securities Act and may not be transferred, sold or otherwise disposed of unless they are subsequently registered or an exemption is available under the Securities Act. Neither this Form 10-K, nor the exhibits attached hereto, is an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein.
 
Each share of Series C Preferred is convertible into one share of common stock of the Company automatically upon, but not before receipt of shareholder approval.  However, a holder may elect not to convert, in favor of retaining ownership of the Series C Preferred which would no longer be entitled to any dividends, liquidation preference, redemption rights and other preferences, and subject to further limitations on conversion based on beneficial ownership of the Company's securities by the holder and affiliates of the holder. Purchasers of the securities include a select group of accredited investors, including institutional investors (the "Investors"). Certain of our officers and directors and significant shareholders, are Investors in the Private Placement.

Conversion of the Series C and Series D Preferred Stock. Until we have obtained shareholder approval, we will not issue any shares of common stock in an amount that exceeds 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, in connection with the Series C Preferred or the Series D Preferred.
 Our Common Stock is currently listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market and therefore we are subject to the Nasdaq Listing Rules ("Nasdaq Rules") governing listing requirements (Section 5500 of the Nasdaq Rules for securities listed on the Capital Market) and corporate governance (Section 5600 of the Nasdaq Rules) of companies with securities listed on Nasdaq. Pursuant to the terms of both the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Securities Purchase Agreement, we have covenanted to obtain approval of our shareholders ("Shareholder Approval") as may be required by the Nasdaq Rules for us to issue the shares of common stock underlying the conversion or exercise of any rights under the Series C or the Series D Preferred Stock or the execution of the warrants, including the following:
 Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(a), which requires shareholder approval prior to the issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition of the stock or assets of another company where the total number of shares of common stock to be issued is or will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding before the issuance of the stock or securities;
 Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(b), which requires prior shareholder approval for issuances of securities that could result in a "change of control" of the issuer - Nasdaq may deem a change of control to occur when, as a result of an issuance, an investor or a group would own, or have the right to acquire, 20% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or voting power, and such ownership or voting power of an issuer would be the largest ownership position of the issuer;
 Nasdaq Rule 5635(c), requiring shareholder approval when common stock may be issued to "insiders" (directors, officers, employees or consultants) of the issuer in transactions at prices less than market value, which includes sales deemed to be "equity compensation" paid to insiders, as well as the issuance of common stock at less than market prices in payment of dividends or for redemption of other securities or payment of debt; and
  4
 
Nasdaq Rule 5635(d), which requires shareholder approval prior to the issuance of common stock in connection with certain non-public offerings involving the sale, issuance or potential issuance of common stock (and/or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock) equal to 20% or more of common stock outstanding before the issuance.
 At our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, to be held in November or December 2017, we will seek shareholder approval of these matters as described above. Certain key shareholders of the Company (officers, directors and certain shareholders) have entered into agreements with the Investors and with B&C to vote all voting securities of the Company over which such persons have voting control as of the record date for the meeting of shareholders, amounting to, in the aggregate, at least 35% of all current voting power of the Company in favor of the shareholder approvals described above.
 In connection with the Private Placement and the shares of common stock to be issued upon conversion of the Series D Preferred issued in connection with the Acquisition, we agreed to file registration statements under the Securities Act registering the issuance and resale of all shares of common stock underlying the conversion of the Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred and the exercise of the warrants.
 The rights and preferences of the Series C Preferred and the Series D Preferred will be designated by the Company's Board of Directors in amendments to the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Designations") which will be filed prior to the closing of the Acquisition with the Utah Division of Corporations and Commercial Code.
 The Warrants have an exercise price of $2.75 per share of Common Stock and a term of six years. The Warrants may not be exercised unless and until Shareholder Approval has been obtained. At the election of the holder of the Warrant, the holder may be restricted from the exercise of the Warrant or any portion of the Warrant held by such holder, to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion, such holder (together with such holder's affiliates, and any persons acting as a group together with such holder or any of such holder's affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% (or 9.99%, as such holder may elect) of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise.
 Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. ("Ladenburg") acted as placement agent and we will pay Ladenburg fees for its services in connection with proceeds received in the Private Placement from Investors introduced to the Company by Ladenburg pursuant to its agreement with the Company, in accordance with applicable FINRA rules and regulations. No compensation, fees, or discounts will be paid or given to any other person in connection with the offer and sale of the securities.
 The foregoing descriptions of the Designation, Securities Purchase Agreement, Voting Agreements, and Warrants do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, the full text of these documents, which will be filed as exhibits to our Current Report on Form 8-K regarding the Acquisition.
 Our Products
 We sell products we manufacture and products manufactured by others. Approximately 49% of our net sales (excluding freight, repairs, and miscellaneous items) in fiscal year 2017 were products we manufacture. With Hausmann operations, we expect approximately 65% of our sales to be products we manufacture.
 Our products include a broad line of therapeutic products for physical medicine and athletic training applications including therapy devices, medical supplies and soft goods, custom and standard treatment tables and rehabilitation equipment. They are used primarily by physical therapists, chiropractors, athletic trainers, sports medicine practitioners and other physical medicine professionals. Our Hausmann subsidiary also sells a line of custom cabinetry and furnishings through its institutional division. The following table illustrates our various product categories.

Therapeutic Modalities
 Electrotherapy – The therapeutic effects of electrical energy have occupied an important position in physical medicine for over six decades. Medium frequency alternating currents, which we use primarily in our electrotherapy devices, are believed to be the most effective and comfortable for patients. Electrotherapy can be effective in treating chronic intractable pain and/or acute post-traumatic pain, increasing local blood circulation, relaxation of muscle spasms, prevention or retardation of disuse atrophy, and muscle re-education. 
 Therapeutic Ultrasound – Ultrasound therapy provides therapeutic deep heat to soft tissue through the introduction of sound waves into the body. It is one of the most common modalities used in physical therapy for treating pain, muscle spasms and joint contractures. The new stand-alone Dynatron® 125B ultrasound device was introduced in September 2016. 
 We market a broad line of devices that include electrotherapy, ultrasound or a combination of both of these modalities in a single device. The Dynatron Solaris® Plus and Dynatron 25 Series™ include combination devices that provide electrotherapy and ultrasound therapy treatments to patients. In August 2016, we released upgraded versions of these combination products which have improved their design, manufacturing process, and international reach. The Dynatron 25 Series™ devices target the lower-priced segment of the market while the Dynatron Solaris® Plus products add Tri-Wave phototherapy capabilities as well as thermal therapy available through the patented ThermoStim probe accessory. We will continue to develop our core therapy technology and remain a leader in the design, manufacture and sale of therapy equipment. 
 Phototherapy – Phototherapy has been popular among physical medicine practitioners for its ability to provide topical heating to increase local blood circulation, provide temporary relief of minor muscle and joint aches, pain and stiffness, as well as to treat minor pain and stiffness associated with arthritis. The benefits of phototherapy have been documented by numerous research studies published over the past four decades that indicate applications beyond those approved for use in the United States including such areas as accelerated wound healing. 
  6
 
Our Dynatron Solaris® 709Plus, 708Plus, 707Plus, 706Plus, and 705Plus units all feature phototherapy technology. The Dynatron Solaris® Plus products are capable of powering either the handheld Tri-Wave phototherapy probe or the larger Tri-Wave phototherapy pads. The Dynatron® Tri-Wave pad is capable of treating larger areas of the body via unattended infrared, red and blue wavelength phototherapy. The Dynatron® Tri-Wave phototherapy probe is used in an attended mode targeting specific treatment sites by the practitioner.
 Thermal Therapy – For many decades, physical therapists and other medical practitioners have relied on cold compression therapy as a primary standard of care for treating patient injuries and for post-surgical conditions. In August 2015, we announced a patent for "Systems and Methods for Providing a Thermo-electro-stimulation Probe Device". The innovative ThermoStim Probe incorporates technology designed to deliver thermal therapy (hot or cold) together with electrotherapy treatments. This novel technology has become popular among physical therapists, sports medicine practitioners and athletic trainers for increasing blood circulation, reducing muscle spasm and relieving pain in patients and athletes. 
 Iontophoresis – Iontophoresis uses electrical current to transdermally deliver drugs such as lidocaine for localized treatment of pain and inflammation without the use of needles. The Dynatron® iBox™, our proprietary iontophoresis device, provides support for this market. We also distribute a line of proprietary iontophoresis electrodes under the brand name of Dynatron® Ion electrodes, along with other types of iontophoresis electrodes from other manufacturers. 
 Traction Therapy – We offer a complete line of traction equipment including traction devices, traction tables, traction harnesses and related positioning products. Our traction products are designed to provide static, intermittent, and cycling distraction forces to relieve pressures on structures that may be causing low back or neck pain. These products relieve pain through decompression of intervertebral discs or unloading due to distraction and positioning. During the fiscal year we introduced the new SmarTrac™ traction device. This device replaces the DX2 product we introduced over 10 years ago. 
 Other Modalities – In addition to the modalities listed above we also offer products that incorporate Radial Pulse Therapy that delivers kinetic energy through for the relief of muscle pain and increasing circulation; Short Wave Diathermy that incorporates electromagnetic energy to heat body tissues for therapeutic benefit; Oscillation Therapy that creates an electrostatic field within the patient, resulting in a highly effective treatment for reducing minor muscle aches and pains. 
Medical and Rehabilitation Equipment
 Treatment Tables and Rehabilitation Equipment – We sell power and manually operated treatment tables, mat platforms, parallel bars and work tables.  We also sell training stairs, weight racks, as well as other rehabilitation and athletic training room products.  Most of these products are manufactured at our Tennessee facility for the Dynatronics brand and in our New Jersey facility for the Hausmann brand.
 The Hausmann facility specializes in manufacturing high quality laminated med-surg and rehabilitation products. Laminate construction allows for better contamination control and ease of maintenance over other materials.  Over 75% of Hausmann products are part of an unrivaled "Quick Ship" program promising shipment within 1 to 10 business days from date of order. Last year Hausmann shipped 98% of orders on time. One of the fastest growing segments of our business is the PROTEAM™ line of products for athletic training. The athletic training tables and taping stations are for professional and college teams in over 5,000 locations.
 At our Tennessee facility the focus is on solid wood products. Between the two facilities we cover the spectrum of products for a wide array of customers.  
 Manufactured Medical Supplies and Soft Goods
 We currently manufacture or have manufactured for us over 700 medical supply and soft goods products including hot packs, cold packs, lumbar rolls, exercise balls, wrist splints, ankle weights, cervical collars, slings, cervical pillows, bolsters, positioning wedges, back cushions, weight racks, rehabilitation products and back and wrist braces. By manufacturing our own products we not only assure the best possible quality of product, but we are able to maximize gross profit margins. 
  7
 
Distributed Medical Equipment, Supplies and Soft Goods
 Over the years, we have significantly expanded the number of products from other manufacturers that we distribute including additional exercise equipment, treatment tables, parallel bars, hand therapy products, hot and cold therapy products, lotions and gels, paper products, athletic tape, splints, elastic wraps, exercise weights, exercise bands and tubing, walkers, treadmills, stair climbers, heating units for hot packs, whirlpools, electrodes, hydrotherapy and aquatic exercise products, clinical supplies, diagnostic and evaluation products, orthopedic supports, patient positioners, rehabilitation equipment, traction equipment, wound and edema care products, nutritional supplements, and portable electrotherapy products.
 We market our products through direct sales representatives, independent dealers, our e-commerce websites and our product catalog. We continually seek to update our line of manufactured and distributed medical supplies and soft goods.
 Sales Mix among Key Products
 No single product accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Sales of products manufactured by the Company represented approximately 49% and 44% of total product sales, excluding freight and other revenue, in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in percentage of products manufactured in fiscal year 2017 can be attributed to the acquisition of Hausmann in the last quarter of the fiscal year. As the Hausmann acquisition is fully integrated into our operations, we expect sales of manufactured products as a percentage of net sales to increase to approximately 65% per year.
Patents and Trademarks
 Patents. The United States patent on our thermoelectric technology will remain in effect until February 2033. We also hold a United States patent on our combination traction/phototherapy technology that will remain in effect until December 2026, a United States patent on our phototherapy technology that will remain in effect until August 2025. In addition, we recently filed and have pending a patent application relating to our knee range of motion technology with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
 Trademarks. We have developed and use registered trademarks in our business, particularly relating to our corporate and product names. The trademark Dynatron® has been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, we own United States trademark registrations. Those that are significant to our business include Dynatron Solaris®, Dynaheat®, Body Ice®, Powermatic®, and the Hausmann Logo. Our print materials are also protected under copyright laws, both in the United States and internationally.
 Federal registration of a trademark enables the registered owner of the mark to bar the unauthorized use of the registered mark in connection with a similar product in the same channels of trade by any third party anywhere in the United States, regardless of whether the registered owner has ever used the trademark in the area where the unauthorized use occurs. We may register additional trademarks in countries where our products are or may be sold in the future. Protection of registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection in the United States.
 We also claim ownership and protection of certain product names, unregistered trademarks, and service marks under common law. Common law trademark rights do not provide the same level of protection that is afforded by the registration of a trademark. In addition, common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used. We believe these trademarks, whether registered or claimed under common law, constitute valuable assets, adding to recognition of Dynatronics and the effective marketing of Dynatronics products. As long as a registered mark is in use on the goods or services claimed in the registration, the registered owner of the mark may renew the registration. There is no limit to how many times registration can be renewed, subject to the payment of a renewal fee. We believe these proprietary rights have been and will continue to be important in enabling us to compete.
 Trade Secrets. We own certain intellectual property, including trade secrets that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with key employees and other parties involved in research and development. Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors.
  8
 
We intend to protect our legal rights in our intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel.  
 Warranty Service
 We provide a warranty on all products we manufacture for time periods ranging in length from 90 days to five years from the date of sale. We service warranty claims on these products primarily at the Utah, Tennessee and New Jersey facilities depending on the service required. We also have field service available in other parts of the United States and Canada. Our warranty policies are comparable to warranties generally available in the industry. Warranty claims were approximately $144,000 in each of fiscal years 2017 and 2016. We expect this amount to increase in the next year as we will have a full year of sales from our Hausmann operations.
 Products we distribute carry warranties provided by the manufacturers of those products. We do not generally supplement these warranties or provide unreimbursed warranty services for distributed products. We also sell accessory items for our manufactured products that are supplied by other manufacturers. These accessory products carry warranties from their original manufacturers without supplement from us.
 Customers and Markets
 We sell our products primarily to licensed practitioners such as physical therapists, chiropractors, athletic trainers, professional sports teams and universities, sports medicine specialists, post-acute care facilities, hospitals and clinics. We utilize direct sales representatives and independent sales representatives to sell our products together with a network of over 40 independent dealers, with revenue greater than $50,000, throughout the United States and internationally. We have relationships with more than 100 additional independent dealers we are working with to strengthen distribution. Most dealers purchase and take title to the products, which they then sell to end users.
 We have entered into agreements with regional/national chains of physical therapy clinics and hospitals. We sell our products directly to these clinics and hospitals pursuant to preferred pricing arrangements. We also have preferred pricing arrangements with key customers who commit to purchase certain volumes and varieties of products. No single customer or group of related accounts was responsible for 10% or more of net sales in fiscal years 2017 and 2016.
 We export products to approximately 30 different countries. Sales outside North America totaled approximately $814,000 in fiscal year 2017 (or approximately 2.3% of net sales) and $850,000 in fiscal year 2016 (approximately 2.8% of net sales). Our Utah facility is certified to the ISO 13485 quality standard for medical device manufacturing. We also have CE Mark approval for our Dynatron Solaris® Plus family of products. We have clearance to sell our advanced technology devices in numerous markets around the world and have sales efforts ongoing to expand our international footprint. We have no foreign manufacturing operations, but we purchase certain products and components from foreign manufacturers.
 Competition
 We believe our key products are distinguished competitively by our use of the latest technology. Several of our products are protected by patents, or where patents have expired, the proprietary technology on which those patents were based. We believe that the integration of advanced technology in the design of each product has distinguished Dynatronics-branded products in a very competitive market. For example, we were the first company to integrate infrared phototherapy as part of a combination therapy device. The introduction of the ThermoStim probe was the first of its product type on the market. We believe these factors give us a competitive edge. Many of our competitors are solely distributors of competing products whereas the majority of our sales are expected to be products that we manufacture. Also, our distribution channels provide important competitive advantages due to many established relationships with clinics which directly affect the sale and distribution of our products.
 Information necessary to determine or reasonably estimate our market share or that of any competitor in any of these markets is not readily available.

Electrotherapy/Ultrasound
 We compete in the clinical market for electrotherapy and ultrasound devices with both domestic and foreign companies. Approximately 10-15 companies produce electrotherapy and/or ultrasound devices directly competitive with our products. Some of these competitors are larger and better established, and have greater resources than Dynatronics. Other than Dynatronics, few companies, domestic or foreign, provide multiple-modality devices, which is one important distinction between us and our competition. Furthermore, we believe no competitor offers three frequencies on multiple-sized soundheads or provides the proprietary electrotherapy features offered in our electrotherapy devices. We believe that our primary domestic competitors that manufacture competitive clinical electrotherapy and ultrasound equipment include DJO Global (Chattanooga Brand), Compass Health Brands, Rich-Mar, and Mettler Electronics.
 Phototherapy and Thermal Therapy
 We are aware of only two competitors, DJO and Rich-Mar that offer a device that includes phototherapy in combination with electrotherapy and ultrasound capabilities in the same device as we do.
 Dynatronics offers a hand-held accessory, the ThermoStim Probe that provides thermal therapy in combination with electrotherapy. Other manufacturers such as Game Ready or Thermo-Tek offer thermal therapy in combination with compression therapy. We distribute Game Ready products.
 Medical Supplies and Soft Goods
 We compete against various manufacturers and distributors of medical supplies and soft goods, some of which are larger, more established and have greater resources than Dynatronics. Excellent customer service, along with providing online ordering capability and value to customers is of key importance for us to remain competitive in this market. Our competitors are primarily distributors such as Performance Health, Scrip Companies, North Coast Medical and Meyer Distributing All competitors of distributed products rely primarily on catalog, inside sales, or internet sales.
Iontophoresis
 Our competitors in the iontophoresis market include DJO (Iomed), Rich-Mar, Travanti Pharma and North Coast Medical. We believe that our strong distribution network is important to our continued ability to compete in this increasingly competitive market.
Treatment Tables
 Our primary competition in the treatment table market is from domestic manufacturers including Hill Laboratories Company, Performance Health, Bailey Manufacturing, Tri-W-G, DJO, Armedica, Stonehaven, and Clinton Industries. Cardon Industries from Canada is also a competitor. We believe we compete based on our industry experience and product quality. In addition, certain components of the treatment tables are manufactured overseas, which we believe allows for pricing advantages over competitors.
Radial Pulse Therapy and Shortwave Diathermy
 Competitors that distribute Radial Pulse Therapy devices in the United States are CuraMedix, ELvation USA, Mettler Electronics and other smaller companies. CuraMedix imports the STORZ Medical devices and represent the largest portion of the market share of sales in this line of products in the United States.
 There are only a few manufacturers in the United States market that are producing shortwave diathermy units. The three primary companies that are distributing shortwave diathermy in the United States are DJO/Chattanooga, Accelerated Care Plus (ACP), and Mettler Electronics.
 Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
 We manufacture electrotherapy, ultrasound, phototherapy, iontophoresis, traction and oscillation therapy devices at our facility in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. We manufacture treatment tables, rehabilitation equipment, soft goods, and other medical products at our facilities in Chattanooga, Tennessee and Northvale, New Jersey. We purchase custom components for our manufactured products from third-party suppliers. All parts and components purchased from these suppliers meet established specifications. Trained staff performs all sub-assembly, final assembly and quality assurance testing by following established procedures. Our design and development process ensures that products meet the requirements of the medical device industry. The supply chain process manages quality suppliers of components and materials to ensure their availability for our manufacturing teams.

The development and manufacture of a portion of our products manufactured at our Utah facility, is subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by the FDA and other international regulatory agencies. In compliance with the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or CGMP, and ISO standards we have developed a comprehensive Quality System that processes customer feedback and analyzes product performance trends. Conducting prompt reviews of timely information, allows Dynatronics to respond to customer needs and ensure quality performance of the devices we produce.
 Our Utah facility is certified to ISO 13485:2003 standards for medical products. ISO 13485 is an internationally recognized quality management system standard adopted by over 90 countries. The ISO 13485 certification also allows us to qualify for CE Mark certification. With the CE Mark certification, we are able to market qualified products throughout the European Union and in other countries where CE Mark certification and ISO 13485 certification are recognized. Some of our products manufactured at the Utah facility are CE marked.
 Products manufactured at our facility in Tennessee are subject to our internal quality system which is modeled on the quality system at our facility in Utah.
 Products manufactured at our facility in New Jersey follow a similar pattern of compliance to an internal quality system that meets the requirements of Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP). This quality system controls the production of products meeting the expectations of our customers for quality products and services.
 Research and Development
 Total research and development ("R&D") expenses in fiscal year 2017 were $1,081,000, compared to approximately $1,070,000 in fiscal year 2016. R&D expenses in 2017 were related to development of therapeutic devices introduced in fiscal year 2017 and others expected to be introduced in fiscal year 2018. R&D expenses represented approximately 3.0% and 3.5% of our net sales in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. R&D expenditures are expected to remain near current levels in fiscal year 2018.
Regulatory Matters
 The manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates a portion of our products pursuant to the Medical Device Amendment of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and regulations promulgated thereunder. Advertising and other forms of promotion (including claims) and methods of marketing of the products are subject to regulation by the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, under the Federal Trade Commission Act.
 As a device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and once registered we are subject to inspection for compliance with the FDA's Quality Systems regulations. These regulations require us to manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing, and control activities. Further, we are required to comply with various FDA requirements for reporting customer complaints involving our devices. The FDC Act and its medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been caused or contributed to by the use of our products, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to occur. The FDA also prohibits an approved device from being marketed for unapproved uses. All of our therapeutic treatment devices as currently designed are cleared for marketing under section 510(k) of the Medical Device Amendment to the FDC Act or are considered 510(k) exempt. If a device is subject to section 510(k) approval requirements, the FDA must receive pre-market notification from the manufacturer of its intent to market the device. The FDA must find that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device before the agency will clear the new device for marketing.
 We intend to continuously improve our products after they have been introduced to the market. Certain modifications to our marketed devices may require a premarket notification and clearance under section 510(k) before the changed device may be marketed, if the change or modification could significantly affect safety or effectiveness. As appropriate, we may therefore submit future 510(k) notifications to the FDA. No assurance can be given that clearance or approval of such new applications will be granted by the FDA on a timely basis, or at all. Furthermore, we may be required to submit extensive preclinical and clinical data depending on the nature of the product changes. All of our devices, unless specifically exempted by regulation, are subject to the FDC Act's general controls, which include, among other things, registration and listing, adherence to the Quality System Regulation requirements for manufacturing, medical device reporting and the potential for voluntary and mandatory recalls described above.

The passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Educational Reconciliation Act (the "Health Care Reform Law") in 2010 included new reporting and disclosure requirements for device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain healthcare providers. Specifically, any transfer of value exceeding $10 in a single transfer or cumulative transfers over a one-year period exceeding $100 to any statutorily defined practitioner (primarily physicians, podiatrists, dentists and chiropractors, or a teaching hospital) must be reported to the federal government by March 31st of each year for the prior calendar year. The data will be assembled and posted to a publicly accessible website by September 30th following the March 31st reporting date. If we fail to provide these reports, or if the reports we provide are not accurate, we could be subject to significant penalties. Several states have adopted similar reporting requirements. We believe we are in compliance with the Health Care Reform Law and have systems in place to assure continued compliance.
 On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law H.R. 2029, the "Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016", which includes a two-year moratorium on the 
medical device excise 
tax, effective January 1, 2016. The 2.3% tax on sales of medical devices (except certain devices sold at retail) was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and applied to device sales beginning on January 1, 2013. Absent further legislative action, the tax will be automatically reinstated for medical device sales starting on January 1, 2018.
 In March 2017, FDA published guidance relating to Class II devices that would no longer be required to submit a pre-market notification (510(k)). This list was finalized in the Federal Register on July 11, 2017. Among the Class II devices exempted by this determination are some phototherapy devices such as those manufactured by us. That guidance indicates that such devices are considered safe and effective without adding the burden of a pre-market approval by the FDA. While this change diminishes the regulatory burden for such products, it also lowers the barriers to entry for competitive products. We view this change as generally positive for the Company and our ability to leverage existing technology competencies in this segment.
 Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines, and criminal prosecutions. Any such action by the FDA could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products. Our Utah, Tennessee and New Jersey facilities are inspected periodically by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's CGMP and other requirements, including appropriate reporting regulations and various requirements for labeling and promotion. The FDA Current Quality Systems Regulations are similar to the ISO 13485 Quality Standard. The CGMP regulation requires, among other things, that (i) the manufacturing process be regulated and controlled by the use of written procedures, and (ii) the ability to produce devices that meet the manufacturer's specifications be validated by extensive and detailed testing of every aspect of the process.
 Advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the FTC under the FTC Act. Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Section 12 of the FTC Act provides that the dissemination or the causing to be disseminated of any false advertisement pertaining to, among other things, drugs, cosmetics, devices or foods, is an unfair or deceptive act or practice. Pursuant to this FTC requirement, we are required to have adequate substantiation for all advertising claims made about our products. The type of substantiation required depends upon the product claims made.
 If the FTC has reason to believe the law is being violated (e.g., the manufacturer or distributor does not possess adequate substantiation for product claims), it can initiate an enforcement action. The FTC has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement, both administratively and judicially, including compulsory process authority, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement could result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, consumer redress, and divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, or such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of such orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Any such action against us by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products.
 From time to time, legislation is introduced in the Congress of the United States or in state legislatures that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing, and marketing of medical devices and products like those we manufacture. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance, or interpretations will be changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be on our business and our results of operations. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, domestically or internationally, would have on our business in the future. They could include, however, the recall or discontinuance of certain products, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, and additional scientific substantiation. The necessity of complying with any or all such requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

In addition to compliance with FDA rules and regulations, we are also required to comply with international regulatory laws including Health Canada, CE Mark, or other regulatory schemes used by other countries in which we choose to do business. Foreign governmental regulations have become increasingly stringent and more common, and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by foreign governmental authorities in the future. Penalties for a company's non-compliance with foreign governmental regulation could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company's business license and criminal sanctions. Any domestic or foreign governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on us. We believe all of our present products are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable performance standards in countries where the products are sold. We also believe that our products comply with CGMP, record keeping and reporting requirements in the production and distribution of the products in the United States.
 Foreign Government Regulation
 Although it is not a current focus we intend to expand our efforts to market our products in European and other select international markets in the future. The regulatory requirements for our products vary from country to country. Some countries impose product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions on some of the devices we manufacture and distribute. Each country has its own tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Environment
 Environmental regulations and the cost of compliance with them are not material to our business.
 Seasonality
 We believe that the effect of seasonality on the results of our operations is not material.
 Backlog
 Our backlog represents orders received and waiting to be shipped on a given day either because of lead time delays or because of customer requests for specific delivery dates beyond the period end. Backlog is not a term recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. As of June 30, 2017, we had a backlog of orders of approximately $2,643,000, compared to approximately $1,543,000 as of June 30, 2016. The increase in the backlog of approximately $1,100,000 as of June 30, 2017, compared to June 30, 2016, was due primarily to the Hausmann acquisition which added backlog of $1,064,000 as of June 30, 2017. We expect to see the backlog of orders gradually increase over historic levels as sales grow.
Employees
 On June 30, 2017, we had a total of 233 employees, of which 219 were full-time employees and 14 were part-time employees. Included in these figures were 91 employees at our Hausmann division, 56 of which are union employees. By comparison, we had 153 employees (139 full-time and 14 part-time, none of which was represented by any collective bargaining agreement or union) on June 30, 2016. We believe our labor relations with both union and non-union employees are satisfactory.
