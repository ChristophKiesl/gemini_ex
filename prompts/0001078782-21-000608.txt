Item 1. Business
 
The Company was incorporated in Nevada on February 6, 2002. Our Company is engaged in the business of acquisition and exploration of mineral properties within the Homestake Gold District (“District”) of the Black Hills of South Dakota. To date, while no development or mining activities have commenced, our strategy is to move projects from exploration to development and finally into production as results of exploration may dictate. 
Dakota Territory maintains 100% ownership of eight mineral properties in the district comprised of approximately 1,000 unpatented claims and a combination of surface leases and/or ownership covering a total of approximately 19,500 acres located in the Black Hills of South Dakota, including the Blind Gold, City Creek, Tinton, West Corridor, Ragged Top, Poorman Anticline and Homestake Paleoplacer Properties, all of which are located in the heart of the Homestake District. Our goal is to obtain sufficient capital to advance our current property portfolio, to fund acquisition of additional prospective mineral properties, and for the general working capital needs of the Company.

Recent Developments
 
Dakota Territory entered into an agreement with JR Resources Corp. (“JR”) on May 27, 2020, as subsequently amended (“Purchase Agreement”), whereby JR loaned the Company $1,150,000 and the Company granted JR the right to purchase up to 35,641,667 shares of common stock at $0.60 per share (approximate 64% of the Company on a fully diluted basis) in one or more closings on or prior to March 17, 2021 (“Termination Date”). On October 15, 2020, the Company and JR effected the first closing under the Purchase Agreement whereby JR purchased 17,416,667 shares of Company common stock for aggregate consideration of $10,450,000, $9,000,000 in cash and $1,450,000 upon conversion of the principal amount of the May 2020 promissory note. The Purchase Agreement allowed Dakota to advance its mineral property acquisition strategy. On March 12, 2021, the Company and JR effected the second and final closing under the Purchase Agreement, whereby JR purchased 18,225,000 shares of Company common stock for aggregate consideration of $10,935,000, $10,635,000 in cash and $300,000 upon conversion of the principal amount of a promissory note issued in January 2021. The final closing resulted in a change of control (“Change of Control”). 
 
Jonathan Awde was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Gerald Aberle resigned as Chief Executive Officer and was appointed Chief Operating Officer. As a result of the Change of Control, the Company board consists of members recommended by JR, the JR designees, and certain current Company directors, as Company designees, it being understood that the number of Company directors shall initially not exceed five, and that the number of JR designees at any given time shall be one more than the number of Company designees. Robert Quartermain and Jonathan Awde were appointed to the Company board concurrently with Richard Bachman’s resignation from the Company board. 
 
Until the earlier to occur of (i) April 15, 2022 and (ii) a listing of the Company common stock (or the common stock of a successor-in-interest to the Company) to the NYSE or the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Standstill Period”), JR has agreed to the following corporate governance provisions, among others:
 
·
to not vote its shares of common stock to remove any Company designee without the consent of a majority of the Company designees or approve a material amendment to the articles of incorporation or the amended bylaws unless approved and recommended by a majority of the Company Designees;  
 
·
JR shall vote its shares of common stock for the election of Company designees; 
 
·
any transaction between JR or any of its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand (including, without limitation, the issuance of Company capital stock or derivative securities to JR or any of its affiliates and entering into certain business combinations by and between JR, the Company and any of their respective affiliates), shall be subject to approval by the Company designees and the JR designees shall recuse themselves from voting on the approval of such transactions; and  
 
·
not to engage in proxy solicitations or certain communications (other than in connection with a sale of the Company to a third party), or acquire additional shares of Company common stock or assets of the Company, in each case without the approval of the Company designees.

On May 14, 2021, the Company announced it had entered into a definitive merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with JR.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, JR and the Company have incorporated a new company (“NewCo”) that will acquire all of the outstanding securities of JR and of the Company in exchange for securities of NewCo (the “Merger”). Shareholders of JR will receive a number of NewCo shares of common stock equal to their percentage shareholding in JR multiplied by the 35,641,667 Dakota Territory shares that JR owns. Shareholders of the Company other than JR will receive one share of common stock of NewCo for each share of common stock of the Company.
 
In addition, at the closing of the Merger, (i) each outstanding option to purchase Dakota Territory common stock, whether vested or unvested, will be assumed and converted into an option with respect to a number of shares of NewCo common stock in the manner set forth in the Merger Agreement, (ii) each outstanding warrant to purchase JR common stock, whether or not exercisable, will be assumed and converted into a warrant with respect to a number of shares of NewCo common stock in the manner set forth in the Merger Agreement, (iii) any outstanding awards of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Dakota Territory common stock will be assumed and converted into the right to receive an award of restricted stock units representing a right to receive a number of shares of NewCo common stock in the manner set forth in the Merger Agreement and (iv) NewCo will change its name to “Dakota Gold Corp.”
 
The completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions for a transaction of this nature, including securities law compliance, the approval of JR shareholders and the approval of Dakota Territory shareholders. In addition, in connection with the Merger, the Company and JR intend to cause NewCo to prepare and file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). 
 
In June 2020, the Company secured the services of New-Sense Geophysics Ltd. (“New-Sense”) to undertake a high-resolution helicopter-borne district scale magnetic and radiometric survey of the Northern Black Hills of South Dakota. Robert B. Ellis (EGC Inc.) has been engaged to process and model the data, and to work with the Dakota Territory’s technical team to integrate the high resolution geophysics with the Company’s geology and geochemistry data sets. The results of this survey have been utilized as a basis for acquisition of new properties, as well as for program planning on the existing properties. In addition, Dakota engaged Magee Geophysical Services LLC in April 2021 to conduct a broad ground-based gravity survey comprised of approximately 1,500 stations located across the Northern Black Hills. The survey has commenced and should be completed mid-summer. 
 
In October 2020, we closed the purchase of the Maitland Gold Property in the Black Hills of South Dakota from Homestake Mining Company of California, a wholly owned subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”), for consideration of $3.5 million cash and the issuance of 750,000 shares of Dakota Territory’s common stock. Additionally, Barrick retained a 2.5% net smelter returns royalty on the property. The 2,112 mineral-acre Maitland acquisition secures an important component of the Company’s strategy for the structural corridor that extends from the Homestake Gold Mine to the Company’s Blind Gold Property at the northern end of the Black Hills District.
 
In January 2021, the Company purchased an office building located at 141 Glendale Dr., Lead, South Dakota 57754 to serve as the Company’s new corporate headquarters. The cash purchase price of the building, furniture, fixtures and other property was approximately $755,000. The building, built in the 1890’s as a railroad roundhouse, was completely renovated between 2000 and 2010 and is approximately 13,500 square feet with mixed use office and retail.
 
Corporate History
 
The Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation and has not realized any revenues from operations. For a full discussion of the general development of the Company’s business, see the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2020 at https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1182737/000107878220000497/f10k033120_10k.htm. The Company’s gold initiatives in the year ended March 31, 2021 included:
 
·
The May 2020 acquisition of 67 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 1,045 acres located on the western margin of the structural corridor that extends north of the Homestake Gold Mine. The West Corridor property is located just south of the mineral property Dakota Territory acquired from Deadbroke Mining Company in March of 2014, just north of the producing Wharf Mine (Coeur Mining) and just to the south and east of the former Richmond Hill Mine (Barrick Gold). We believe that the Property is a target for both Homestake Iron Formation hosted gold mineralization and tertiary-aged replacement gold and silver mineralization hosted in the younger sedimentary and igneous rocks.

·
The July 2020 staking of 166 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 3,152 acres located immediately north and adjacent to the Company’s City Creek Property. Through this staking, the City Creek project area was expanded from approximately 1,167 acres to 4,319 acres. The City Creek Property is comprised of a combination of patented and unpatented mining claims covering the continuous extension of the iron-formation gold host northeast of the Homestake Mine. The City Creek geology is dominated by the Homestake, Ellison and Poorman stratigraphic sequence that has been delineated by more than 40,000 ft of core drilling across the property. The historic drilling also documents the occurrence of gold mineralization in the classic quartz vein, chlorite-arsenopyrite style of the Homestake Mine. 
 
·
The September 15, 2020 acquisition of 50 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 840 acres at the historic Ragged Top Gold Camp of the Black Hills of South Dakota. 
Tertiary-aged gold mineralization in the Ragged Top area is hosted primarily in the Paha Sapa Limestone formation and has been mined from both vertical fissures called “Verticals” and from collapsed breccias. The Ragged Top acquisition is located just northwest of the producing Wharf Mine (Coeur Mining) and approximately 3 miles southwest of the former Richmond Hill Mine (Barrick Gold). Dakota Territory believes the Property to be prospective for additional tertiary-aged limestone hosted gold mineralization and for tertiary-aged gold and silver replacement mineralization in the preferred Deadwood formation host that lies under the cover of the limestone that dominates the surface exposure. 
 
·
The October 26, 2020 purchase of the Maitland Gold Property from Homestake Mining Company of California, a wholly owned subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”). At closing, the Company paid Barrick $3.5 million cash and issued 750,000 shares of its common stock valued at $1.76 per share, for total consideration of $4.82 million. Additionally, Barrick retained a 2.5% net smelter returns royalty on the property. The 2,112 mineral-acre Maitland acquisition is an important component of Dakota Territory’s exploration and development strategy for the structural corridor that extends from the Homestake Gold Mine to the Company’s Blind Gold Property at the northern end of the District. 
 
·
The November 25, 2020 acquisition of 64 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 1,092 acres located south and to the west of the former Homestake Gold Mine at Lead, South Dakota. The Poorman Anticline geological structure is the southwestern-most known extension of the Homestake iron-formation host in the district. Gold mineralization was discovered underground on the 2600 and 4100 foot levels in the far western extents of the Homestake Mine in the 1950's and 60’s with little historic follow-up exploration in the Poorman Anticline closer to surface. Dakota Territory’s targeting in the Poorman Anticline is based on the presence of the Homestake iron-formation host and projected intersections with important shear fabric that is known to have conducted fluids necessary to the deposition of gold mineralization in the northern extents of the structural corridor. 
 
·
The January 26, 2021 acquisition of 143 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 2,468 acres. The acquisition was based on continuing analysis of the Company’s historic data sets coupled with new insights derived from the Company’s district-scale airborne geophysical survey flown during the summer of 2020. The acquisition increased the acreage covered by three of the Company’s existing project areas. At the west side of the Homestake District, the Tinton property was extended to the north and northwest adding approximately 1,966 acres to the original claim block. In the central region of the District, the West Corridor property was extended west to Cleopatra Creek covering approximately 242 additional acres between Richmond Hill and Wharf gold mines, and the Blind Gold Property was expanded west adding approximately 260 acres immediately north of the Richmond Hill Mine. 
 
·
The March 8, 2021 acquisition of 39 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 806.5 acres at the eastern boundary of the Company’s Tinton Property. Tinton was the site of placer mining activity between 1876 and 1900, the lode source for which has not been discovered. Our original Tinton claim block was located based on historic research and exploration conducted by members of our technical team while at Homestake Mining Company in the 1980’s and 1990’s, which suggested a Pre-Cambrian lode source at depth. The latest property acquisition is focussed on additional younger Tertiary-aged gold mineralization in the younger sedimentary and igneous rocks covering the property. 
 
·
The March 9, 2021 acquisition by option of 25 patented mining claims covering approximately 307 acres at the eastern boundary of the northern segment of the Company’s Ragged Top Property. Two additional unpatented lode claims covering approximately 29 acres were also acquired by staking and added at the north end of the property on/around the same date. The Ragged Top Property has been subject to historic mining operations producing Tertiary-aged gold and silver mineralization primarily from vertical fissures and collapsed breccias within the Paha Sapa limestone unit. The Ragged Top property is located just northwest of the producing Wharf Mine (Coeur Mining) and approximately 3 miles southwest of the former Richmond Hill Mine (Barrick Gold).

·
The May 21, 2021 purchase of surface and mineral title to approximately 213 acres located contiguous to the northwest boundary of the Company’s West Corridor Property. The property is located just south of the mineral property the Company acquired from Deadbroke Mining Company in the Maitland Area in March of 2014, just north of the producing Wharf Mine (Coeur Mining) and just to the south and east of the former Richmond Hill Mine (Barrick Gold). The purchased property is subject to a 2% NSR Royalty held by Homestake Mining Company of California and a buyback right for 51% interest in the property subject to, among other provisions, the establishment of a 1,000,000-ounce reserve and/or inferred resource from one or more deposits located within a one-kilometer area of influence surrounding the property. 
 
U.S. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any defined resources will ever be converted into SEC Guide 7 Compliant Reserves. We have not established that any of our properties contain proven or probable reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7.
 
Competitors
 
The mining industry is highly competitive. We will be competing with numerous companies, some with greater financial resources available to them. We therefore will be at a significant disadvantage in the course of acquiring mining properties and obtaining materials, supplies, labor, and equipment. Additionally, there are established and well-financed companies active in the mining industry that will have an advantage over us if they are competing for the same properties. 
Government Approvals
 
The exploration, drilling and mining industries operate in a legal environment that requires permits to conduct virtually all operations. Thus, permits are required by local, state and federal government agencies. Local authorities, usually counties, also have control over mining activity. The various permits address such issues as prospecting, development, production, labor standards, taxes, occupational health and safety, toxic substances, air quality, water use, water discharge, water quality, noise, dust, wildlife impacts, as well as other environmental and socioeconomic issues.
 
Prior to receiving the necessary permits to explore or mine, the operator must comply with all regulatory requirements imposed by all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project area. Very often, in order to obtain the requisite permits, the operator must have its land reclamation, restoration or replacement plans pre-approved. Specifically, the operator must present its plan as to how it intends to restore or replace the affected area. Often all or any of these requirements can cause delays or involve costly studies or alterations of the proposed activity or time frame of operations, in order to mitigate impacts. All these factors make it more difficult and costly to operate and have a negative and sometimes fatal impact on the viability of the exploration or mining operation. Finally, it is possible that future changes in these laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our business, causing those activities to be economically re-evaluated at that time.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Government and Environmental Regulations
 
Mineral exploration, including mining operations are subject to governmental regulation. Our operations may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation such as restrictions on production, price controls, tax increases, expropriation of property, environmental and pollution controls or changes in conditions under which minerals may be marketed. An excess supply of certain minerals may exist from time to time due to lack of markets, restrictions on exports, and numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include market fluctuations and government regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, allowable production and importing and exporting minerals. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately determined, and we are not aware of any probable government regulations that would impact the Company. This section is intended as a brief overview of the laws and regulations described herein and is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the subject matter.
Overview. Like all other mining companies doing business in the United States, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations designed to protect the quality of the air and water, and threatened or endangered species, in the vicinity of its operations. These include “permitting” or pre-operating approval requirements designed to ensure the environmental integrity of a proposed mining facility, operating requirements designed to mitigate the effects of discharges into the environment during exploration, any mining operations, and reclamation or post-operation requirements designed to remediate the lands affected by a mining facility once any commercial mining operations have ceased.
 
Federal legislation in the United States and implementing regulations adopted and administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”), the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies—in particular, legislation such as the federal Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Forest Management Act, the Wilderness Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act—have a direct bearing on domestic mining operations. These federal initiatives are often administered and enforced through state agencies operating under parallel state statutes and regulations.

The Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act is the principal federal environmental protection law regulating mining operations in the United States as it pertains to water quality.
 
At the state level, water quality is regulated by the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources of the State of South Dakota. If our exploration or any future development activities might affect a ground water aquifer, it will have to apply for a Ground Water Discharge Permit from the Ground Water Quality Bureau in compliance with the Groundwater Regulations. If exploration affects surface water, then compliance with the Surface Water Regulations is required.
The Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act establishes ambient air quality standards, limits the discharges of new sources and hazardous air pollutants and establishes a federal air quality permitting program for such discharges. Hazardous materials are defined in the federal Clean Air Act and enabling regulations adopted under the federal Clean Air Act include various metals. The federal Clean Air Act also imposes limitations on the level of particulate matter generated from mining operations.
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires all governmental agencies to consider the impact on the human environment of major federal actions as therein defined.
 
Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA requires federal agencies to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitat. In order to facilitate the conservation of imperiled species, the ESA establishes an interagency consultation process. When a federal agency proposes an action that “may affect” a listed species, it must consult with the USFWS and must prepare a “biological assessment” of the effects of a major construction activity if the USFWS advises that a threatened species may be present in the area of the activity.
National Forest Management Act. The National Forest Management Act, as implemented through title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, provides a planning framework for lands and resource management of the National Forests. The planning framework seeks to manage the National Forest System resources in a combination that best serves the public interest without impairment of the productivity of the land, consistent with the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960.
Wilderness Act. The Wilderness Act of 1964 created a National Wilderness Preservation System composed of federally owned areas designated by Congress as “wilderness areas” to be preserved for future use and enjoyment.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). CERCLA imposes clean-up and reclamation responsibilities with respect to discharges into the environment, and establishes significant criminal and civil penalties against those persons who are primarily responsible for such discharges.
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). RCRA was designed and implemented to regulate the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. It restricts solid waste disposal practices and the management, reuse or recovery of solid wastes and imposes substantial additional requirements on the subcategory of solid wastes that are determined to be hazardous. Like the Clean Water Act, RCRA provides for citizens’ suits to enforce the provisions of the law.
National Historic Preservation Act. The National Historic Preservation Act was designed and implemented to protect historic and cultural properties. Compliance with the Act is necessary where federal properties or federal actions are undertaken, such as mineral exploration on federal land, which may impact historic or traditional cultural properties, including native or Indian cultural sites.
 
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we incurred minimal costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations in relation to our operating activities, although costs may increase in future periods.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2021 we have no employees. Our management conducts our operations. Given the early stage of our exploration properties, we outsource certain of our personnel requirements by retaining consultants on an as needed basis.
Insurance
 
Where prudent and available at reasonable premiums, we maintain insurance sufficient to cover losses or risks incurred in the ordinary course of our current business.
