Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
U.S. Energy Corp. (“U.S. Energy”, the “Company”, “we” or “us”) is a Wyoming corporation organized in 1966. We are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas producing properties in the continental United States. Our business activities are currently focused on the Gulf Coast of Texas, South Texas, Southeastern New Mexico, Wyoming and the Williston Basin in North Dakota.
 
We have historically explored for and produced oil and natural gas through a non-operator business model. As a non-operator, we primarily rely on our operating partners to propose, permit, drill, complete and produce oil and natural gas wells. Before a well is drilled, the operator provides all oil and natural gas interest owners in the designated well the opportunity to participate in the drilling and completion costs and revenues of the well on a pro-rata basis. Our operating partners also produce, transport, market and account for all oil and natural gas production. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we acquired operated properties in the Williston Basin, North Dakota, the Texas Gulf Coast, the Permian Basin in New Mexico and the Powder River Basin in Wyoming.

Oil and Natural Gas Operations
 
During 2020 we actively pursued acquisitions of exploration, development and production-stage oil and natural gas properties or companies resulting in three separate acquisitions of operated and non-operated properties. We participate in oil and natural gas projects as both a non-operating working interest owner through exploration and development agreements with various oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and as an operator. Our working interest varies by project and may change over time based on the terms of our leases and operating agreements. These projects may result in numerous wells being drilled over the next three to five years depending on, among other things, commodity prices and the availability of capital resources required to fund the expenditures. We are also actively pursuing potential acquisitions of exploration, development and production-stage oil and natural gas properties or companies. Key attributes of our oil and natural gas properties include the following:

● | Estimated proved reserves of 1,255,236 BOE (78% oil and 22% natural gas) as of December 31, 2020, with a standardized measure value of $8.6 million. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | As of December 31, 2020, our oil and natural gas leases covered 90,136 gross acres and 6,064 net acres. 
● | 134 gross (30.7 net) producing wells as of December 31, 2020. 
● | 218 BOE per day average net production for 2020.

Acquisition of Operated Properties
 
During 2020 we acquired operated properties in the Williston Basin, North Dakota, the Permian Basin in New Mexico, the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and in the Gulf Coast of Texas. Although production from the operated properties was only 4,598 BOE during 2020, they represented $3.7 million, or 42.6% of the PV-10 related to our oil and gas reserves at December 31, 2020. The operated properties have an average working interest of approximately 96% and an average net revenue interest of 81%.
Activities with Operating Partners
 
We own working interests in a geographically and geologically diverse portfolio of oil-weighted prospects in varying stages of exploration and development. Prospect stages range from prospect origination, including geologic and geophysical mapping, to leasing, exploratory drilling and development. The Company participates in the prospect stages either for its own account or with prospective partners to enlarge its oil and natural gas lease ownership base.
 
Each of the operators of our principal prospects has a substantial technical staff. We believe that these arrangements currently allow us to deliver value to our shareholders without having to build the full staff of geologists, engineers and land personnel required to work on diverse projects involving horizontal drilling in North Dakota, New Mexico and South Texas. However, consistent with industry practice with smaller independent oil and natural gas companies, we also utilize specialized consultants with local expertise, as needed.
 
Presented below is a description of significant oil and natural gas projects with our key operating partners, which constitute the majority of our production and reserves. In addition to the below descriptions, the Company holds interests in non-operated wells with several operators, which constitute the remainder of our PV-10.
 
Williston Basin, North Dakota (Bakken and Three Forks Formations)
 
Zavanna, LLC. We have an interest in multiple wells with Zavanna, LLC (“Zavanna”) with an average working interest of approximately 16% and net revenue interests ranging from 2% to 31%. These properties operated by Zavanna comprised approximately 25.1% of the PV-10 related to our oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2020.
Permian Basin, New Mexico
 
Cimarex Energy Company. During 2020 we acquired an interest in three wells Cimarex Energy Company operates in Lea County, New Mexico. We currently hold a 43.8% working interest and a 36.3% net revenue interest in these wells. All of the leases are currently held by production and comprised approximately 15.3% of the PV-10 related to our oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2020.
Texas (Gulf Coast)
 
Contango Resources Inc. We have an interest in multiple wells with Contango Resources Inc., which is the operator of the Leona River and Booth Tortuga prospects in which we currently hold a 29% working interest and a 22.2% net revenue interest. All of the leases are currently held by production and comprised approximately 5.5% of the PV-10 related to our oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2020.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations and properties are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment, and relating to safety and health. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation generally is toward stricter standards, and this trend will likely continue. These laws and regulations may:

● | Require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8
-


● | Limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness and other protected areas; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations. 

 
The permits required for our operations may be subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce their regulations, and violations are subject to fines or injunctions, or both. In the opinion of management, we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on our company, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general.
 
Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint and several liabilities on owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of “hazardous substances” found at such sites. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, persons who disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at the site, and any person who accepted hazardous substances for transportation to the site. CERCLA authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), state environmental agencies, and in some cases third parties, to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of “hazardous substance,” state laws affecting our operations may impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum related products.
 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). RCRA is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes. Analogous state laws also impose requirements associated with the management of such wastes. In the course of our operations, we and others generate petroleum hydrocarbon wastes, produced water and ordinary industrial wastes. RCRA currently exempts drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration development, or production of crude oil, natural gas, or geothermal resources from regulation as hazardous wastes, allowing us to manage these wastes under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements. A similar exemption is contained in many of the state counterparts to RCRA.
 
Previously, following the filing of a lawsuit by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its non-hazardous waste (RCRA Subtitle D) criteria regulation for oil and natural gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in December 2016. Under the decree, the EPA was required to propose no later than March 15, 2019 a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. The EPA missed the March 15, 2019 deadline, but in April 2019, the EPA determined that revisions to the federal regulations for the management of wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and geothermal energy under Subtitle D of RCRA were not necessary. This determination fulfilled EPA’s obligations under the referenced 2016 Consent Decree.
 
The imposition of new federal requirements under RCRA Subtitle D can result in an increase of our operating expenses. Moreover, repeal or modifications of the exemption for certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes to be classified and regulated as non-hazardous by administrative, legislative or judicial process, or through changes in applicable state statutes, would increase the volume of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose and would cause us, as well as our competitors, to incur significantly increased operating expenses.
 
Federal, state and local laws may also require us to remove or remediate wastes or hazardous substances that have been previously disposed or released into the environment. This can include removing or remediating wastes or hazardous substances disposed or released by us (or prior owners or operators) in accordance with then current laws, suspending or ceasing operations at contaminated areas, or performing remedial well plugging operations or response actions to reduce the risk of future contamination.

The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”). The ESA seeks to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animal, fish and plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species. Under the ESA, exploration and production operations, as well as actions by federal agencies, may not significantly impair or jeopardize the species or its habitat. The ESA provides for criminal penalties for willful violations of the ESA. Other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and that may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. Although we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with such statutes, any change in these statutes or any reclassification of a species as endangered could subject our company (directly or indirectly through our operating partners) to significant expenses to modify our operations or could force discontinuation of certain operations altogether. Further, the ESA prohibits the taking of endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our assets and lease acreage may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in material compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species in areas where we intend to operate could materially limit or delay our plans.
 
Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and state air pollution laws and regulations provide a framework for national, state and local efforts to protect air quality. Applicable to our business and operations, the CAA regulates emissions, discharges and controls with respect to oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. The CAA includes New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) for the oil and natural gas source category to address emissions of sulfur dioxide, methane and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) from new and modified oil and natural gas production, processing and transmission sources as well as a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. Further, the CAA regulates the emissions from compressors, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment as well as leak detection for natural gas processing plants. These rules have required a number of modifications to the operations of our third-party operating partners, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from compressors.
 
In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions at specified sources. For example, under the EPA’s NSPS and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) regulations, since January 1, 2015, owners and operators of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells (wells drilled principally for the production of natural gas) have been required to use so-called “green completion” technology to recover natural gas that formerly would have been flared or vented. In 2016, the EPA issued additional rules for the oil and natural gas industry to reduce emissions of methane, VOCs and other compounds. These rules apply to certain sources of air emissions that were constructed, reconstructed, or modified after September 18, 2015. Among other things, the new rules impose green completion requirements on new hydraulically fractured or re-fractured oil wells and leak detection and repair requirements at well sites. We do not expect that the currently applicable NSPS or NESHAP requirements will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, any future laws and their implementing regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permitting requirements or require us to use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions.
 
On December 17, 2014, the EPA proposed to revise and lower the existing 75 ppb National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone under the CAA to a range within 65-70 ppb. On October 1, 2015, the EPA finalized a rule that lowered the standard to 70 ppb. This lowered ozone NAAQS could result in an expansion of ozone nonattainment areas across the United States, including areas in which we operate. Oil and natural gas operations in ozone nonattainment areas likely would be subject to more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements for new sources, and increased permitting delays and costs. This could require a number of modifications to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from our wells.
 
Permit and related compliance obligations under the CAA, each state’s development and promulgation of regulatory programs to comport with federal requirements, as well as changes to state implementation plans for controlling air emissions in regional non-attainment or near-non-attainment areas, may require oil and natural gas exploration and production operators to incur future capital and operating expenditures in connection with the addition or modification of existing air emission control equipment and strategies.

Clean Water Act. The federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or the Clean Water Act (the “CWA”), and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of produced waters and other pollutants into navigable waters. The CWA and certain state regulations prohibit the discharge of produced water, sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings, sediment and certain other substances related to the oil and natural gas industry into certain regulated waters without an individual or general discharge permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater and/or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of the CWA require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of waters of the United States in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak.
 
The reach and scope of the CWA, and the determination of what water bodies and land areas are regulated as waters of the U.S., is the subject of various rules adopted by EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (which we refer to as the WOTUS Rules), and on-going federal court litigation arising out of the rules and recent amendments. The WOTUS Rules, litigation over the rules, and the associated regulatory uncertainty, could impact our operations by subjecting new land and waters to regulation and increase our cost of operations. The CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of oil and other pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges, for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release.
 
Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”). Federal regulations also require certain owners and operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil to prepare and implement spill response plans relating to the potential discharge of oil into surface waters. The OPA, and analogous state laws, contain numerous requirements relating to prevention of, reporting of, and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. A failure to comply with OPA’s requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill response action may subject a responsible party to civil or criminal enforcement actions. The OPA establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that release oil into waters of the United States. The OPA and its associated regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. A “responsible party” under the OPA includes owners and operators of certain onshore facilities from which a release may affect waters of the United States.
 
Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”). The disposal of oil and natural gas wastes into underground injection wells are subject to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended, and analogous state laws. The SDWA’s Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) Program establishes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting of injection well activities as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminants into underground sources of drinking water. State programs may have analogous permitting and operational requirements. In response to concerns related to increased seismic activity in the vicinity of injection wells, regulators in some states are considering additional requirements related to seismic safety. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission (“RRC”) adopted new oil and natural gas permit rules in October 2014 for wells used to dispose of saltwater and other fluids resulting from the production of oil and natural gas in order to address these seismic activity concerns within the state. Among other things, the rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells, and allow the RRC to modify, suspend, or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. If new regulatory initiatives are implemented that restrict or prohibit the use of underground injection wells in areas where we rely upon the use of such wells in our operations, our costs to operate may significantly increase and our ability to continue production may be delayed or limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells may cause degradation of freshwater, potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource, and imposition of liability by third parties for property damages and personal injury.

The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”). OSHA and comparable state laws regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established workplace safety standards that provide guidelines for maintaining a safe workplace in light of potential hazards, such as employee exposure to hazardous substances. OSHA also requires employee training and maintenance of records, and the OSHA hazard communication standard and EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.
 
Hydraulic Fracturing. Substantially all of the oil and natural gas production in which we have interests is developed from unconventional sources that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and oil from dense subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Over the years, there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies, and proposals have been made to enact separate federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and natural gas regulatory programs, but where these operations occur on federal or tribal lands, they are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”). The EPA has taken the following actions and issued: guidance under the SDWA for hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel; final regulations under the federal CAA governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of volatile organic compounds and methane emissions released during hydraulic fracturing; and finalized rules in June 2016 that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants.
 
In addition, the BLM finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. However, in December 2017 the BLM finalized a rule repealing its March 2015 hydraulic fracturing regulations. The repeal has been challenged in court and the final outcome is uncertain at this time.
 
In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The EPA has not proposed to take any action in response to the report’s findings, and additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level appears unlikely at this time.
 
While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, the prospect of additional federal legislation related to hydraulic fracturing appears remote at this time. In addition to federal legislative and regulatory actions, some states and local governments have considered imposing, or have adopted, various conditions and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing operations. This includes states where we have interests. Louisiana and Texas, for example, have adopted legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Moreover, some states and local governments have enacted laws or regulations limiting hydraulic fracturing within their borders or prohibiting the activity altogether. In the event that new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
 
In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. Recently, several municipalities have passed or proposed zoning ordinances that ban or strictly regulate hydraulic fracturing within city boundaries, setting the stage for challenges by state regulators and third parties. Similar events and processes are playing out in several cities, counties, and townships across the United States. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in the future plan to conduct, operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and could even be prohibited from drilling and/or completing certain wells.

In May 2014, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act to initiate a stakeholder process to request input on various aspects of obtaining information on chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas exploration and production. To date, no further action has been taken on the proposal.
 
National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lands, including tribal lands and lands administered by the BLM, are subject to NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the BLM, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. If we were to conduct any exploration and production activities on federal lands in the future, those activities may need to obtain governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay, limit or increase the cost of developing oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt projects. Many of our activities and those of our third-party operating partners are covered under categorical exclusions which results in a shorter NEPA review process, however, the impact of the NEPA review process on our activities and those of our third-party operating partners is uncertain at this time and could lead to delays and increased costs that could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
 
Climate Change
 
The EPA has determined that greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment and has issued regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the CAA. These regulations include limits on tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles and preconstruction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”). The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from a variety of sources in the United States, including certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis, including GHG emissions from completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. In June 2016, the EPA published NSPS Subpart OOOOa standards that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. However, in April 2017, the EPA announced that it would review this methane rule for new, modified and reconstructed sources and initiated reconsideration proceedings to potentially revise or rescind portions of the rule. In June 2017, the EPA also proposed a two-year stay of certain requirements of the methane rule pending the reconsideration proceedings. The stay, however, was vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in July 2019. Accordingly, the June 2016 rule remains in effect, however, in September 2019, the EPA proposed amendments to the 2012 and 2016 NSPS for the oil and gas industry. The rule’s primary proposal would redefine the types of sources covered under the oil and gas industry to remove all sources in the transmission and storage segment of the oil and natural gas industry from regulation under the NSPS, both for ozone-forming VOCs and GHGs. In addition, the primary proposal would rescind emission limits for methane from the remaining segments in the oil and gas industry – production and processing. As a secondary proposal, EPA would not redefine the types of sources covered under the oil and gas NSPS, but would still rescind the methane emission limits for the oil and gas industry. The rule would retain VOC standards for the production, processing, and transmission and storage segments of the industry. The comment period for this rulemaking ended on November 25, 2019 and EPA has not taken further action at this time.
 
Similarly, in November 2016, the BLM issued a final rule to reduce methane emissions by regulating venting, flaring, and leaks from oil and natural gas operations on federal and American Indian lands. California and New Mexico have challenged the rule in ongoing litigation. In addition, in April 2018, a coalition of states filed a lawsuit aiming to force the EPA to establish guidelines for limiting methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas section; that lawsuit is currently pending. These rules, should they remain in effect, or any other new methane emission standards imposed on the oil and natural gas sector, could result in increased costs to our operations as well as result in delays or curtailment in such operations, which costs, delays or curtailment could adversely affect our business. The potential increase in operating costs could include new or increased costs to (i) obtain permits, (ii) operate and maintain our equipment and facilities, (iii) install new emission controls on equipment and facilities, (iv) acquire allowances authorizing greenhouse gas emissions, (v) pay taxes related to greenhouse gas emissions and (vi) administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. In addition to these federal actions, various state governments and/or regional agencies may consider enacting new legislation and/or promulgating new regulations governing or restricting the emission of greenhouse gases from stationary sources.

Currently, federal legislation related to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions appears unlikely; however, many states have established greenhouse gas cap and trade programs, and others are considering carbon taxes or initiatives that promote the use of alternative fuels and renewable sources of energy. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce, which could in turn have the effect of lowering the value of our reserves. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency in its 2019 World Energy Outlook report estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and natural gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other extreme weather events. Such events could disrupt our operations or result in damage to our assets and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our third-party operating partners are required to report their GHG under these rules. Although we cannot predict the cost to comply with current and future rules and regulations at this point, compliance with applicable rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.
 
In addition, the United States was actively involved in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years. The Paris Agreement, which went into effect in November 2016, could further drive regulation in the United States. While the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement in in November 2020 under then President Trump, President Biden has since taken action for the United States to rejoin the Paris Agreement. Separately, certain U.S. city and state governments have announced their intention to satisfy their proportionate obligations under the Paris Agreement. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that have been or may be imposed in various states, or at the federal level could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources as a means of addressing climate change could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.
 
Research and Development
 
No research and development expenditures have been incurred during the past three fiscal years.
 
Insurance
 
We have liability insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient for our business operations, consisting of property loss insurance on all major assets equal to the approximate replacement value of the assets and additional liability and operator’s and control of well insurance for our oil and natural gas operations and drilling programs. Payment of substantial liabilities in excess of coverage could require diversion of internal capital away from regular business, which could result in curtailment of projected future operations.

In 2021 and beyond, we intend to seek additional opportunities in the oil and natural gas sector, including but not limited to further acquisition of assets, participation with current and new industry partners in their exploration and development projects, acquisition of existing companies, and the purchase of oil producing assets. In addition, we plan to grow production by performing workovers on operated idle wells acquired in 2020 to return them back to production.
Business Strategy
 
Key elements of our business strategy include:
 

● | Deploy our Capital in a Conservative and Strategic Manner and Review Opportunities to Bolster our Liquidity. In the current industry environment, maintaining liquidity is critical. Therefore, we will be highly selective in the projects we evaluate and will review opportunities to bolster our liquidity and financial position through various means. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Evaluate and Pursue Value-Enhancing Transactions. We will continuously evaluate strategic alternative opportunities that we believe will enhance shareholder value. 

Industry Operating Environment
 
The oil and natural gas industry is affected by many factors that we generally cannot control. Government regulations, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy, climate change and the environment, can have a significant impact on operations and profitability. Significant factors that will impact oil prices in the current fiscal year and future periods include political and social developments in the Middle East, demand in Asian and European markets, and the extent to which members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil exporting nations manage oil supply through export quotas. Additionally, natural gas prices continue to be under pressure due to concerns about excess supply of natural gas due to the high productivity of emerging shale plays in the United States. Natural gas prices are generally determined by North American supply and demand and are also affected by imports and exports of liquefied natural gas. Weather also has a significant impact on demand for natural gas since natural gas is a primary heating source.
 
In early March 2020, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19, which resulted in a drastic decline in global demand of certain mineral and energy products including crude oil. As a result of the lower demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the oversupply of crude oil, spot and future prices of crude oil fell to historic lows during the second quarter of 2020, which remained depressed for the majority of 2020. Operators in North Dakota’s Williston Basin responded by significantly decreasing drilling and completion activity and shutting in or curtailing production from a significant number of producing wells, all of which have since come back online. Operators decisions on these matters are changing rapidly and it is difficult to predict the future effects on the Company’s business. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues, but an extended decline in oil or gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial position, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures and the oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce.
 
Additionally, the outbreak of COVID-19 and decreases in commodity prices resulting from oversupply, government-imposed travel restrictions, and other constraints on economic activity have caused a significant decrease in the demand for oil and has created disruptions and volatility in the global marketplace for oil and gas which began in the first quarter of 2020, and continued through most of 2020, which negatively affected our results of operations and cash flows. While demand and commodity prices have recently recovered and are back to pre-pandemic levels, our financial results may continue to be depressed in future quarters. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals’ actions in response to the pandemic; the availability and efficacy of vaccines; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact the supply and demand for oil and gas and our ability to produce and transport oil and gas and perform operations at and on our properties. This uncertainty also affects management’s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including investments, receivables, and forward-looking guidance.

Development
 
Until acquiring operated properties during 2020, we primarily engaged in oil and natural gas exploration and production by participating, on a proportionate basis, alongside third-party interests in wells drilled and completed in spacing units that include our acreage. In addition, from time-to-time, we acquire working interests in wells in which we do not hold the underlying leasehold interests from third parties unable or unwilling to participate in well proposals. We typically depend on drilling partners to propose, permit and initiate the drilling of wells. Prior to commencing drilling, our partners are required to provide all owners of oil, natural gas and mineral interests within the designated spacing unit the opportunity to participate in the drilling costs and revenues of the well to the extent of their pro-rata share of such interest within the spacing unit. We assess each drilling opportunity on a case-by-case basis and participate in wells that we expect to meet our return thresholds based upon our estimates of ultimate recoverable oil and natural gas, expected oil and natural gas prices, expertise of the operator, and completed well cost from each project, as well as other factors. Historically, we have participated pursuant to our working interest in a vast majority of the wells proposed to us.
 
During 2020, we acquired operated interests in several wells in North Dakota, New Mexico, Wyoming, and the Texas Gulf Coast. Beginning in December 2020 and throughout 2021, our development efforts will be focused on returning idle wells to production.
 
Competition
 
The oil and natural gas industry is extremely competitive, and we compete with numerous other oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Some of these companies have substantially greater resources than we have. Not only do other companies explore for and produce oil and natural gas, many also engage in midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. The operations of other companies may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties. Our competitors may also have more resources to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit.
 
Larger or integrated competitors may be better able to absorb the burden of existing and future federal, state, and local laws and regulations than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to discover reserves and acquire additional properties in the future will be dependent upon our ability and resources to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. In addition, we may be at a disadvantage in producing oil and natural gas properties and bidding for exploratory prospects because we have fewer financial and human resources than other companies in our industry. Should a larger and better financed company decide to directly compete with us, and be successful in its efforts, our business could be adversely affected.
 
Marketing and Customers
 
The market for oil and natural gas produced from our properties depends on factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas, the proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities, demand for oil and natural gas, the marketing of competitive fuels and the effects of state and federal regulation. The oil and natural gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers.

Our oil production is sold at prices tied to the spot oil markets. Our natural gas production is sold under short-term contracts and priced based on first-of-the-month index prices or on daily spot market prices. For our non-operated production, we rely on our operating partners to market and sell our production. Our operating partners include a concentrated list of exploration and production companies, from large publicly traded companies to small, privately held companies.
 
Seasonality
 
Winter weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit or temporarily halt our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations and those of our operating partners. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt the operations of our operating partners and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Such seasonal anomalies can also pose challenges for meeting well drilling objectives and may increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay or temporarily halt our operations and those of our operating partners.
Governmental Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to various rules, regulations and limitations impacting the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry as whole.
 
Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production
 
Our oil and natural gas exploration, production and related operations are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state, tribal and local authorities and agencies. For example, North Dakota requires permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and imposes other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Many states may also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the sourcing and disposal of water used in the process of drilling, the flaring of natural gas, completion and abandonment, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells, and the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, many states impose a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within their jurisdictions. Failure to comply with any such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry will most likely increase our cost of doing business and may affect our profitability. Because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective.
 
Regulation of Transportation of Oil
 
Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil by common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate and access regulation. The FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system (based on inflation) for transportation rates for oil pipelines that allows a pipeline to increase its rates annually up to a prescribed ceiling, without making a cost-of-service filing. Every five years, the FERC reviews the appropriateness of the index level in relation to changes in industry costs. On December 17, 2015, the FERC established a new price index for the five-year period that commenced on July 1, 2016.

Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors that are similarly situated.
 
Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is generally governed by pro-rationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors.
 
Regulation of Transportation and Sales of Natural Gas
 
Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”) and regulations issued under those statutes. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
 
Onshore gathering services, which occur upstream of FERC jurisdictional transmission services, are regulated by the states. Although the FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non-jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function, the FERC’s determinations as to the classification of facilities is done on a case-by-case basis. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.
 
Intrastate natural gas transportation and facilities are also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies, and certain transportation services provided by intrastate pipelines are also regulated by FERC. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
 
Recent Developments
 
On February 11, 2021, we sold 1,131,500 shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering at a public offering price of $5.10 per share (the “Offering”). The Offering closed on February 17, 2021. The net proceeds to us from the Offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and Offering expenses, were $5.3 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, capital expenditures, working capital, and potential acquisitions of oil and gas properties.
 
On March 4, 2021 we entered into a Debt Conversion Agreement with APEG Energy II, L.P. (“APEG II”) beneficially owned by our former director, Patrick E. Duke. Pursuant to the Debt Conversion Agreement, APEG II converted a total of approximately $413,000, representing the principal amount of the Secured Promissory Note of $375,000 and accrued interest of approximately $38,000 into 97,962 unregistered shares of our common stock. The number of shares was based on a conversion price of $4.21 per share, a 9.9% discount to the ten-day volume weighted average price of our common stock for the ten days immediately preceding the signing of the Debt Conversion Agreement (the “Discounted VWAP”).
 
Also, on March 4, 2021, APEG II entered into a Subscription Agreement with us, whereby APEG II subscribed to purchase 90,846 unregistered shares of our common stock for an aggregate of approximately $383,000 based on the Discounted VWAP. The $383,000 subscription price was paid by way of forgiveness by APEG II of the same amount of funds owed by us for reimbursement of APEG II’s legal costs in connection with certain shareholder derivative actions brought by APEG II against us and our former Chief Executive Officer in Colorado and Texas, which were dismissed in May 2020 and August, respectively.
 
On March 9, 2021, we entered into a commodity derivative contract to fix the price of 100 barrels of crude oil per day from March 1 to December 31, 2021 at $61.90 based on the calendar month average of WTI Crude Oil.
