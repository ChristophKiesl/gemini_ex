Item 1. Business
Overview
Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. ("CBA") is the seventh largest craft brewing company in the U.S. and a leader in brewing, branding, and bringing to market world-class American craft beers and beverages.
Our distinctive portfolio combines the power of Kona Brewing Co., one of the top craft beer brands in the world, with strong regional breweries and innovative lifestyle brands, Appalachian Mountain Brewery ("AMB"), Cisco Brewers, Omission Brewing Co., Redhook Brewery, Square Mile Cider Co., Widmer Brothers Brewing, and Wynwood Brewing Co. We nurture the growth and development of our brands in today’s increasingly competitive beer market through our state-of-the-art brewing and distribution capability, integrated sales and marketing infrastructure, and strong focus on innovation, local community and sustainability.
CBA was formed in 2008 through the merger of Redhook Brewery and Widmer Brothers Brewing, the two largest craft brewing pioneers in the Northwest at the time. Following a successful strategic brewing and distribution partnership, Kona Brewing Co. joined CBA in 2010. As part of CBA, Kona has expanded its reach across all 50 U.S. states and approximately 30 countries, while remaining deeply rooted in its home of Hawaii.
As consumers increasingly seek more variety and more local offerings, Craft Brew Alliance has expanded its portfolio and home markets with strong regional craft beer brands in targeted markets. In 2015 and 2016, we formed strategic partnerships with Appalachian Mountain Brewery, based in Boone, North Carolina; Cisco Brewers, based in Nantucket, Massachusetts; and Wynwood Brewing Co., based in the heart of Miami’s vibrant multicultural arts district. Building on the success of these partnerships, we acquired all three brands in the fourth quarter of 2018, fundamentally transforming our footprint and paving the way to increase our investments in their growth and drive shareholder value.
We proudly brew and package our craft beers in three company-owned production breweries located in Portland, Oregon; Portsmouth, New Hampshire; and Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. In 2019, we continued to leverage our contract brewing agreement with A-B Commercial Strategies, LLC (“ABCS”), an affiliate of Anheuser-Busch, LLC (“A-B”), through which we brew select CBA brands in A-B’s Fort Collins, Colorado brewery. Additionally, we own and operate five innovation breweries in Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Boone, North Carolina; and Miami, Florida, which are primarily used for small-batch production and limited-release beers offered primarily in our brewpubs and brands’ home markets.
We distribute our beers to retailers through wholesalers that are aligned with the A-B network. These sales are made pursuant to a Master Distributor Agreement (the “A-B Distributor Agreement”) with A-B, which extends through 2028. As a result of this distribution arrangement, we believe that, under alcohol beverage laws in a majority of states, these wholesalers would own the exclusive right to distribute our beers in their respective markets if the A-B Distributor Agreement expires or is terminated. As competition puts increasing pressure on craft brands outside of their home markets, in 2019 we invested in accelerating Kona’s growth through our first-ever national marketing campaign, expanded distribution of our newly acquired brands Appalachian Mountain Brewery, Cisco Brewers, and Wynwood Brewing Co. across their respective home markets of North Carolina, New

England, and South Miami, and continued our efforts to stabilize and strengthen Widmer Brothers and Redhook in the Pacific Northwest, which is a mature craft beer market.
Separate from our A-B wholesalers, we maintain an internal independent sales and marketing organization with resources across the key functions of brand management, field marketing, field sales, and national retail sales.
On November 11, 2019, CBA and Anheuser-Busch Companies, LLC ("ABC") jointly announced an agreement to expand their partnership, with ABC agreeing to purchase the remaining CBA shares it does not currently own in a merger transaction for $16.50 per share, in cash. ABC was formed in 1979 as the holding company of A-B. The transaction represents an exciting next step in a long and successful partnership between the two companies that traces back over 25 years. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by a majority of CBA’s shareholders not affiliated with ABC and certain regulatory approvals. For additional information about the merger transaction, see "Agreement and Plan of Merger" on page 11 of this report. 
We operate in two segments: Beer Related operations and Brewpubs operations. Beer Related operations include the brewing, and domestic and international sales, of craft beers and ciders from our breweries. Brewpubs operations primarily include our five brewpubs, four of which are located adjacent to our Beer Related operations, as well as other merchandise sales, and sales of our beers directly to customers.
Publicly traded on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol BREW, Craft Brew Alliance is headquartered in Portland, Oregon and operates breweries and brewpubs across the U.S. For more information about CBA and its brands, see “Available Information” on page 16 of this report.
Industry Background
We are one of the top seven brewers in the craft brewing segment of the U.S. brewing industry. The domestic beer market includes ales and lagers produced by large domestic brewers, international brewers and craft brewers. As the overall domestic market experienced a decrease in shipments of 0.8% in 2019, the craft beer segment also began to show signs of a slowdown. Shipments of craft beer in the U.S. are estimated by industry sources to have increased by 3.8% in 2019 over 2018, compared to a 0.6% decrease in 2018 over 2017. Of total beer shipped in the U.S., craft beer shipments were approximately 12.9% in 2019 and 12.4% in 2018. Approximately 27.1 million barrels and 26.1 million barrels, respectively, were shipped in the U.S. by the craft beer segment during 2019 and 2018, while total beer sold in the U.S., including imported beer, was 204.9 million barrels and 205.5 million barrels, respectively. Compared with the other segments of the U.S. brewing industry, craft brewing is a relative newcomer. Twenty years ago, Redhook and Widmer Brothers Brewery were two of the approximately 200 craft breweries in operation. By the end of 2019, the number of craft breweries in operation had grown to more than 7,500. Industry sources estimate that craft beer produced by regional and national craft brewers, similar to CBA, accounts for approximately two-thirds of total craft beer sales, with one-third of the production brewed by smaller craft breweries.
Our comprehensive portfolio and national scale provide a competitive advantage in today’s market environment, which includes craft brewers, domestic specialty beers, and imports. Our distinctive brand portfolio is positioned to address significant changes in consumer trends, including increased demand for innovative flavors and styles, a growing interest in sustainability, and the increasing importance of local community relevance. As an example, Kona Brewing is one of the top craft brewers, with a broad portfolio of beers that reflect a uniquely Hawaii-inspired flavor profile, a recognized track record in sustainable business practices, and deep ties to its local community as Hawaii’s longest-running craft brewery.
Business Strategy 
At Craft Brew Alliance, we believe we have an advantaged strategy to sustain long-term growth in today’s increasingly complex beer market. 
The central elements of our business strategy in 2019 were:

• | Increased focus on topline growth, driving our Kona Plus portfolio strategy, supporting our strong regional craft brands in their home markets, and unlocking the potential of Kona as a global lifestyle brand.


• | Building on healthy business fundamentals, including strong revenue management and improved supply chain execution to expand gross margin.


• | Actualizing the future, through leveraging CBA’s enhanced partnership agreements with Anheuser-Busch to drive growth, value and cost savings, while continuing to explore potential new opportunities for innovation and to invest in our talent and culture.

Key Differentiators
Following are key differentiators that create competitive advantage for CBA in today’s rapidly evolving craft beer segment:

• | A distinctive portfolio of authentic craft beer brands anchored by Kona Brewing Co., which combines the power of a Top 10 national craft beer brand with a strong stable of award-winning lifestyle and regional craft brands.


• | A transformational strategic relationship with Anheuser-Busch InBev, through which we have been able to gain access to the best route to market in the industry, optimize our brewery footprint, and support Kona’s global growth.


• | A national brewing footprint that allows us to get our beers to market faster, fresher and more efficiently. We have significant flexibility to fully leverage the specific strengths of our distinct breweries and operations, as well as A-B's Fort Collins, Colorado brewery. Additionally, we guarantee the quality and consistency of all of our products through fine-tuned processes designed to ensure that everything, from brewing to quality-assurance to warehousing and distribution, meets our high standards. We believe that maximizing production under our direct supervision and through accomplished and expert partners is critical to our success. Further, we believe that our ability to engage in ongoing product innovation while controlling product quality provides critical competitive advantages. Each of our breweries is modern, has flexible production capabilities, and is designed to produce beer in smaller batches compared to the national domestic brewers, thereby allowing us to brew a wide variety of brand offerings. We believe that our investment in brewing and logistics technologies enables us to minimize brewery operating costs and consistently produce innovative beer styles.


• | National seamless distribution as an aligned brand within the Anheuser-Busch wholesaler network. This distribution footprint provides efficiencies in logistics and product delivery, state reporting and licensing, billing and collections. We have realized these efficiencies while maintaining full autonomy over the production, sale and marketing of our products as an independent craft beer company.


• | An experienced leadership team with expertise in the beer and beverage industries. The team has a proven ability to manage brand lifecycles, from development to turnaround, in both large and growth-company settings.


• | A commitment to innovation. In 2019, we built on our extensive consumer research initiative and formally launched The pH Experiment, a standalone business unit committed to driving our future growth.

Brand Overview
Our portfolio includes national lifestyle brands Kona Brewing Company and Omission Brewing, as well as regional craft brands Appalachian Mountain Brewery, Cisco Brewers, Redhook Brewery, Square Mile Cider Company, Widmer Brothers Brewing, and Wynwood Brewing Co., each with deep community roots.
We produce a variety of specialty craft beers, ciders and seltzers using traditional brewing methods complemented by American innovation and invention. We brew our beers using high-quality hops, malted barley, wheat, rye and other natural traditional and nontraditional ingredients. Our seltzers are made with organic cane sugar and are naturally gluten free.
Below is an overview of our eight owned brands:
Kona Brewing Company
Kona Brewing Company was started in Kailua-Kona on the Island of Hawaii in the spring of 1994 by father and son team Cameron Healy and Spoon Khalsa, who had a dream to create fresh, local island brews made with spirit, passion and quality.
Today, Kona is Hawaii’s largest and favorite craft brewery, known for top-selling flagship beers Big Wave Golden Ale and Longboard Island Lager and award-winning innovative small-batch beers available across the islands. The Hawaii born and Hawaii-based craft brewery prides itself on brewing the freshest beer of exceptional quality closest to market. This helps to minimize its carbon footprint by reducing shipping of raw materials, finished beer and packaging materials. In 2019, we continued work on Kona’s new 100,000-barrel state-of-the-art brewery, which will be one of the most innovative and sustainable breweries in the world. The new brewery is on schedule to open in Kailua-Kona in the summer of 2020 and will allow Kona to brew more beer on the islands and meet increasing demand in its home state, while saving precious natural resources.
Kona Brewing Company has become one of the top craft beer brands in the world, while remaining steadfastly committed to its home market through a strong focus on innovation, sustainability and community outreach.
Omission Brewing Co.
Founded in 2012, Omission Brewing Co. is the first craft beer brand in the U.S. focused exclusively on brewing great-tasting beers with traditional beer ingredients, including malted barley, that are specially crafted to remove gluten. Each batch of Omission Beer is tested independently using the R5 competitive ELISA test to ensure that it contains gluten levels below the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) gluten-free standard of 20ppm or less. Omission’s line up of beers is the most awarded within the gluten

reduced segment, and includes Omission Lager, Omission Pale Ale, Omission IPA, and Omission Ultimate Light Golden Ale, a full-flavored gluten-reduced ale with only 99 calories and 3 carbs. In 2019, the portfolio expanded to include a line of all-natural hard seltzers.
Appalachian Mountain Brewery
Nestled in the High Country of North Carolina, Appalachian Mountain Brewery (AMB) is Boone, NC’s beer pioneer. The brewery is dedicated to making seriously delicious craft beer while focusing its business model on community, sustainability and philanthropy. Through its beers, AMB supports a variety of non-profits that are dedicated to enriching the land, water, air and people of the High Country. AMB has earned numerous awards for its innovative craft beers and ciders, including three medals from the highly prestigious Great American Beer Festival in 2018, which recognized Lager, Boone Creek Blonde Ale and Not an IPA (P.S., it’s an IPA) out of thousands of entries. Boone Creek Blonde also won Gold at the 2017 Great American Beer Festival Competition and 2015 U.S. Open Beer Championships. AMB’s Not a Double IPA won a Silver Medal at the 2018 Great American Beer Festival. The brewery’s core portfolio also includes Long Leaf IPA, Spoaty Oaty Pale Ale, and Porter, which was a gold medal winner at the 2015 Great International Beer and Cider Competition.
Cisco Brewers
Founded by hard-working, entrepreneurial islanders who began selling beer from their outdoor brewery near Cisco Beach in 1995, Cisco Brewers is Nantucket’s first craft brewery. Since then, Cisco has carved out its own special place on Nantucket where they tough out the winters to celebrate the summers. Over the years they’ve attracted a cult following with visitors to the island and open the door to anyone willing to make the trek. Named a top travel destination by Time Magazine, Huffington Post, Travel & Leisure and Men's Journal, Cisco’s brewery is a common ground where people from all walks of life connect over classic and approachable craft beers like Whale’s Tale Pale Ale, Grey Lady Ale, Sankaty Light Lager, and most recently, Gripah IPA. In addition to its Nantucket location, Cisco operates a brewpub in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and seasonal pop-up pubs in New England.
Redhook Brewery
Redhook was born out of the entrepreneurial spirit of the early 1980s in the heart of Seattle. While the term didn’t exist at the time, Redhook became one of America’s first craft breweries with its focus on creating a better beer. From a modest start in a former transmission shop in the Seattle neighborhood of Ballard, to a Fremont trolley barn that housed The Trolleyman brewpub, to its current brewery in Seattle, Washington, Redhook continues its passion for brewing innovative beers that stand apart in today’s crowded craft beer marketplace.
Redhook opened Brewlab, an experimental 10-barrel brewery and pub in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle in 2017, and it is continuously recognized as being among Seattle's best breweries and brewpubs.
Redhook’s beer lineup includes year-round offerings Big Ballard Imperial IPA, Long Hammer IPA, ESB, El Sonido Mexican-Style Lager, and Peaches for Me IPA, and a variety of seasonal beers, including Winterhook and Atomic Robot IPA.
Square Mile Cider Company
Launched in 2013, Square Mile Cider is the hard cider for the modern-day pioneers celebrating the spirit of the Pacific Northwest. We set out to reinvigorate an enduringly classic American beverage with a blend of hand-selected apples combined with unique Northwest ingredients. Square Mile Cider produces three varieties of hard cider: Original Apple Cider, Hopped Apple Cider, and Rosé Apple Cider, which debuted in 2017 as one of the first rosé ciders in the market.
Widmer Brothers Brewing
Widmer Brothers Brewing was founded in 1984 in Portland, Oregon. Brothers Kurt and Rob Widmer, with help from their father, Ray, helped lead the Pacific Northwest craft beer movement when they began brewing unique interpretations of traditional German beer styles. In 1986, Widmer Brothers Brewing introduced the original American-style Hefeweizen, which elevated the brewery to national acclaim. Since then, Hefe has grown to become Oregon’s favorite craft beer and the brewery has continued to push the boundaries, developing beers with an unapologetic, uncompromised commitment to innovation.
Widmer Brothers currently brews a variety of award-winning beers. Its flagship Hefe has won more than 30 medals, including nine from the Great American Beer Festival. The brewery’s other beers include Upheaval IPA, Drop Top Amber Ale, and a full seasonal lineup.

Wynwood Brewing Company
Wynwood Brewing Company is Miami’s first craft production brewery. Founded by Luis Brignoni and his father Luis “Pops” Brignoni Sr., Wynwood is deeply rooted in its founders’ Puerto Rican heritage and the brewery’s namesake neighborhood, the vibrant Wynwood Arts District. Wynwood Brewing Co. operates a 15-barrel brewhouse and taproom in the heart of the Wynwood Art District and distributes a variety of year-round, seasonal and limited beer offerings throughout South Florida, including flagship La Rubia Blonde Ale, Laces IPA, and Pop’s Porter, which earned a Gold Medal at the 2014 Great American Beer Festival.
Developments in Brands and Packaging 
Our recent brand and packaging developments include:
Kona Brewing
In 2019, Kona Brewing Co. celebrated its 25th anniversary as Hawaii’s favorite and longest-running brewery with the release of Hibiscus Brut IPA. Featuring hibiscus - Hawaii’s national flower - and hop-based hints of gooseberry and melon, Hibiscus Brut IPA boasts a gorgeous light rose hue, and clean, dry finish thanks to Nelson Sauvin and Hallertau Blanc hops that complement the beer’s wine-like resemblance. The celebratory beer released on draft across Hawaii in February and launched nationally in September as part of Kona’s limited-release Aloha Series, a series of unique, island-inspired beers with ingredients that bring the flavors of Hawaii to fans on the mainland.
2019 represented another year of robust growth for Kona, bolstered by the launch of CBA’s first-ever national media campaign tied to the NCAA March Madness tournament. Kona increased volumes by 4% over the prior year and again exceeded the growth rate for the overall craft category. Kona’s growth was primarily led by flagship Big Wave, which added a 19.2-ounce can format to its portfolio in 2019 to offer fans even more ways to enjoy the popular, easy-drinking golden ale. Big Wave grew sales to retailers by 17% over 2019. In 2019, Kona’s Dawn Patrol initiative incentivized wholesalers to help grow distribution for Big Wave and Longboard Lager, contributing to thousands of new placements across the U.S. Kona Brewing Co. beers are distributed across all 50 states and approximately 30 countries worldwide. 
Omission Brewing Co.
Omission Brewing Co. remains the market leader in the gluten-removed beer category. In 2019, Omission launched its first-ever line of all-natural hard seltzers. Offered in four distinct flavors - Pomegranate-Blueberry-Acai, Orange Twist, Lime, and Grapefruit - the seltzers enhance Omission’s better-for-you portfolio, which includes the 99-calorie, 3-carb Ultimate Light Golden Ale, as the perfect go-to for all drinking occasions while supporting fans on their journey to a well-balanced life. Featuring a clean, streamlined design, the new seltzers are available nationally in 12-ounce cans, offered in a 12-pack Variety Pack and Pomegranate-Blueberry-Acai 6-pack.
Appalachian Mountain Brewery
In 2019, Appalachian Mountain Brewery expanded distribution of its award-winning Lager beyond North Carolina into South Carolina and Tennessee in 12-ounce cans. With this expansion, Lager joins AMB’s core portfolio, Long Leaf IPA, Boone Creek Blonde and Not an IPA (P.S., it’s an IPA), which are distributed across North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. AMB launched two new series in 2019 - Cloud Pleaser, a rotating line of hazy IPAs, and its new Sour Series. The first beer in the Sour Series was Margarita Gose, one of the most requested beers in AMB’s NC taproom, which rolled out in 12-ounce cans across North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. At 3.8% ABV, Margarita Gose is a traditional easy-drinking German sour brewed with fresh lemons and limes, sea salt, and coriander. AMB’s second sour release was Raspise, a Berliner Weiss bursting with raspberry and mint flavors, launched in August 2019. In November 2019, AMB introduced the third beer in its sour series, Slice of Paradise, a kettle sour inspired by a Southern pie made with peaches, vanilla, cinnamon, and graham cracker. AMB launched its Cloud Pleaser series in 16-ounce 4-pack cans across North Carolina with the release of Thunder Cloud - an IPA fermented with mango - in February, before rolling out Mumantus Milkshake, a hazy IPA brewed with peaches and lactose; Space Cloud, an IPA made with apricots; Sunrise, and IPA brewed with dragonfruit and pineapple; Nuclear, a grapefruit IPA; and Sunset, an IPA brewed with plum. 
In 2019, AMB also entered into two local partnerships- with Appalachian State University and Beech Mountain Brewing Company, a part of Beech Mountain Resort, North Carolina’s premier destination for winter and summer sports. As part of its agreement with Appalachian State University, AMB released Yosef Golden Ale, a light ale developed by AMB master brewer and co-founder Nathan Kelischek, who graduated from App State. Yosef is sold in black cans featuring Appalachian’s block A logo and is available at AMB’s Boone location, as well as in restaurants, grocery stores and other alcohol-serving establishments throughout the North Carolina High Country. For its first collaboration beer with Beech Mountain Brewing Company, the two breweries collaborated on Beech Bike IPA, a nod to the scenic trails that attract thousands of mountain bikers to Beech Mountain during the warm summer months. To celebrate the winter ski season, AMB and Beech Mountain Brewing Company collaborated on Beech Pow Pow IPA, a 6.2% ABV IPA brewed with orange peel for a bright burst of citrus.

Cisco Brewers 
Cisco expanded its Nantucket Island-inspired portfolio in 2019, with the launch of Getaway IPA and Crantucket Brut Rosé IPA. The two new IPAs joined Cisco’s popular line-up that includes Whale’s Tale Pale Ale, Grey Lady, Shark Tracker Light Lager, and Gripah, a grapefruit IPA. Making its debut as a year-round core offering in 2019, Getaway IPA is a bold, West Coast-style IPA brewed with Mosaic, Chinook, Amarillo, and Simcoe hops that quickly became a pub favorite for its balanced hop flavor, slight spiciness and citrus notes. With its beautiful pink appearance and refreshing effervescence, Crantucket Brut Rosé IPA also quickly gained traction at Cisco’s Portsmouth pub as the perfect limited-release beer for summer and fall.
In May, Cisco Brewers brought back its popular “Island Vibes” Cisco pop-up pub in Boston’s Seaport, featuring a larger footprint, two additional bars serving more award-winning craft beer and wines, more live music and more food trucks. The larger Cisco pop-up space offered a vibrant place for beer lovers and families to enjoy a slice of Nantucket Island life in Seaport six days a week with live music daily from May through October.
Wynwood Brewing Co.
2019 was the year for La Rubia, Wynwood Brewing’s flagship blonde ale. As part of a deliberate marketing strategy to target Hispanic drinkers, Wynwood expanded distribution of La Rubia into Puerto Rico, the founders’ hometown, before heading east to introduce New York and Connecticut barrios to the easy-drinking blonde ale. The expansion builds on La Rubia’s robust double-digit growth in its home of South Florida and is focused on connecting the beer’s easy-drinking style and authentic brand story rooted in family with Hispanic consumers in key markets.
Wynwood completed the addition of a canning line in its brewery in 2019, which allowed the team to roll out two new core packages, Father Francisco, a Belgian style golden ale with aromatic notes of cloves and other spices, and Laces IPA, which pays homage to the sneakers tossed over power lines in the neighborhoods around Wynwood. The canning line also enabled the first-ever distribution of key seasonal offerings such as Wyntoberfest, Rickenbacker Pilsner and others. Wynwood entered into multiple strategic agreements in 2019, most recently a three-year partnership with the Miami Heat to become the “Official Craft Beer” for the popular NBA team. As part of the partnership, Miami HEAT fans can find Wynwood’s flagship La Rubia Blonde Ale, Laces IPA, and rotating seasonal beers on tap at four co-branded Wynwood Brewing and Miami HEAT beer carts in the AmericanAirlines arena. Pop’s Porter bottles, La Rubia bottles, and La Rubia 16-ounce cans are also available throughout the arena. In August, Wynwood’s partnership with Richard Branson-founded cruise line company Virgin Voyages was also announced, through which Wynwood is brewing a custom beer called Stray the Course. The English Pale Ale (EPA) is created by connecting American and English brewing traditions; brewed using American malts and hops in Miami but using an English yeast, tying back to Virgin’s British roots.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, which devastated the Bahamas, Wynwood Brewing organized the largest South Florida brewery collaboration in history, which resulted in 11 breweries tapping Onward Together, a Bohemian pilsner brewed with fruits local to the Bahamas, including mango, sour orange, pineapple and coconut. The beer, which was available on tap only, helped raise awareness and funds for the Bahamas hurricane relief efforts. 
Widmer Brothers Brewing 
In 2019, Widmer Brothers continued to focus on the brewery’s award-winning flagship Hefe, which is the best-selling craft beer in Oregon, with a variety of new package sizes and designs. Widmer Brothers released 18-packs of 12-ounce cans of Hefe, one of the first craft beers available in the popular new package size, and released special edition 19.2-ounce Hefe cans featuring a sleek black and gold design. Widmer Brothers celebrated longstanding partnerships with two of Portland’s favorite sports teams - the Portland Trail Blazers and The Portland Timbers - with the release of co-branded 16-ounce cans of Hefe available in 4-packs throughout the Pacific Northwest during each team’s season. Widmer Brothers is the longest-running craft beer sponsor in the NBA, and the co-branded Hefe and Trail Blazers cans featured a red, white, and black design inspired by the Blazers home jerseys. The co-branded Timbers cans, designed in the team’s signature green and gold, celebrate Hefe as the Official Craft Beer of Portland’s beloved MLS team. The brewery celebrated Hefe Day in May 2019 with a celebration at the taproom and adjacent beer garden featuring $1.00 Hefe specials. 
Widmer Brothers added Tang-a-Rang Tropical Sour and fan-favorite Dreifecta German Style Pilsner to their 2019 seasonal lineup, which includes Brrr Hoppy Red Ale. Tang-a-Rang Tropical Sour is a tart and refreshing beer made with passionfruit, guava, and hibiscus. The beer released in 6-packs and on draft across the Pacific Northwest. Widmer Brothers also brought back Dreifecta German Style Pilsner, a dry, crisp pilsner brewed with a trio of hops that was first introduced as a limited release beer in 2018. Dreifecta released in May 2019 in 6-packs and 12-packs of 12-ounce cans as Widmer Brothers’ summer seasonal.

Widmer Brothers continued to package fan-favorite beers as part of a limited release series. Juicy Sunrise IPA, a tropical and juicy IPA with notes of orange, pineapple, and stone fruit, and Secret Stash IPA, an IPA brewed with hop hash and hemp seeds, both released in March 2019 in 6-packs of 12-ounce cans across the Pacific Northwest. In November, Widmer Brothers released 6-packs and 12-packs of 12-ounce cans of Snow Plow Milk Stout, an award-winning beer that was first brewed in 1999 as the first winning recipe of the Collaborator Project, an annual homebrewing competition with the Oregon Brew Crew. 
The Widmer Way: How Two Brothers Led Portland’s Craft Beer Revolution written by Portland beer writer Jeff Alworth and published by Ooligan Press released in March 2019. The book chronicles brothers Kurt and Rob’s journey from humble homebrewers to craft beer pioneers who saw their Original American Hefeweizen become a national sensation. The brewery also celebrated its 15th annual Oktoberfest with an event at the North Portland brewery campus featuring live music, traditional German food, and plenty of beers on tap, including a small-batch Oktoberfest Ale, a malty märzen-style beer inspired by the first Oktoberfest recipe developed in Bavaria in the 1800s. 
Redhook Brewery 
In 2019, Redhook bolstered its year-round portfolio, which includes Big Ballard Imperial IPA, Long Hammer IPA, ESB, Peaches for Me IPA and Bicoastal IPA, by adding El Sonido Mexican-Style Lager as a new year-round offering. El Sonido Mexican-Style Lager, which pays tribute to the mighty Puget Sound and the artists who live and work in the Seattle area, launched in March 2019 in 6-packs of 12-ounce cans and 4-packs of 16-ounce cans. The vibrant can artwork, which features colorful alebrijes -Mexican folk-art sculptures of mythical creatures -was designed by Victor Melendez, a Seattle artist and designer who drew inspiration from his childhood in Mexico City. The Mexican-style lager bursts with subtle flavors of citrus and, at 5.7% ABV, gives fans a lighter lager with great flavor. A portion of proceeds from El Sonido benefits SMASH, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing access to healthcare to Seattle-area working musicians.
To meet the demand for new package sizes and pack types, Redhook released Big Ballard IPA in three different can sizes - 12-ounce, 16-ounce, and 19.2-ounce - and offered 18-packs of Big Ballard and Long Hammer IPA for the first time. After finding success as a limited-release beer, Redhook added Peaches for Me IPA to its year-round lineup and offered the juicy peach and mango IPA in 19.2-ounce cans and 6-packs of 12-ounce cans. 
Building on the success of the Brewlab Limited Release Series, in 2019 Redhook released two new Limited Release beers based on recipes first brewed in Brewlab’s innovation brewery: Mothers of the Sun Raspberry Saison and Atomic Robot IPA. At 6% ABV, Mothers of the Sun marries summer-fresh raspberries with the beauty of saison yeast, giving the beer distinctive and refreshing flavors with a hint of spice. Redhook tapped Seattle illustrator and tattoo artist Kyler Martz to design the bottle artwork, a whimsical design featuring two goddess-like women emerging from a lake to hold up a shining sun. Mothers of the Sun released in June 2019 in six-packs of 12-ounce bottles throughout Washington state. The beer was also included in Redhook’s new Summer Set Variety Pack, a 12-pack that featured bottles of El Sonido, Tangelic Halo IPA, and Bicoastal IPA. In September 2019, Redhook introduced Atomic Robot IPA, a sessionable, hazy IPA available in 6-packs of 12-ounce cans throughout the Pacific Northwest. Sub Pop Records Creative Director Jeff Kleinsmith brought the Atomic Robot cans to life with a retro-style robot can design.
Square Mile Cider Company
In 2019, Square Mile Cider Company continued to focus on its line of award-winning hard-ciders, transitioning all three -- Rosé Apple Cider, Hopped Apple Cider, and Original Apple Cider - into 12-ounce cans to complement any Pacific Northwest adventure. Square Mile’s portfolio includes Original Apple Cider, a classic American hard cider; Hopped Apple Cider, a hopped version of the classic American hard cider, with the addition of Citra and Galaxy hops; and Rosé Apple Cider, a dry apple cider made with rose hips and hibiscus for a rosé flavor and pink hue. In March, Square Mile also released Rosé Apple Cider in 19.2-ounce cans to capitalize on more drinking occasions. In the fall, Square Mile partnered with Fighting Pretty, a Portland-based non-profit that supports women battling cancer, to donate $1 for every 6-pack of Rosé Cider sold to support the organization. 
Brewing Operations
Brewing Facilities
We use highly automated brewing equipment at our owned production breweries and innovation breweries. As of December 31, 2019, our total owned production capacity was 855,000 barrels. Our breweries include:

• | Oregon Brewery. Our Oregon Brewery is our largest capacity production brewery, which has an annual capacity of 630,000 barrels. In 2019, we leveraged our new canning line, which enabled us to produce a variety of can sizes - such as 12-ounce, 16-ounce and 19.2-ounce - to meet consumer demand.


• | New Hampshire Brewery. Our New Hampshire Brewery utilizes a 100-barrel brewing system, with an annual capacity of 215,000 barrels, and uses an anaerobic waste-water treatment facility with power co-generation that completes the process cycle.

• | Hawaii Brewery. Our current Hawaii Brewery utilizes a 25-barrel brewing system, with an annual capacity of 10,000 barrels, and a 229-kilowatt photovoltaic solar energy generating system to supply approximately 50 percent of its energy requirements through renewable energy. In 2019, we broke ground on construction of a new 100,000-barrel state-of-the-art brewery located steps away from our existing brewery and pub in Kona. The new brewery is being built with best-in-class sustainability and innovation, and is scheduled to go online during the summer of 2020.


• | Innovation Breweries. In 2019, we continued to leverage a 10-barrel small-batch innovation brewery built for Redhook in Seattle. The heart of the new brewery is a High Efficiency Brewing System that uses a mash filter press, allowing us to use significantly less water and energy than a typical brewery. The brewery’s flexibility enables Redhook to produce hundreds of different beer recipes that can be tested in the pub and scaled for larger production based on popularity. Our Portland 10-barrel innovation brewery and New Hampshire 3-barrel innovation brewery - as well as our newly acquired 10-barrel brewery in North Carolina and 15-barrel brewery in Florida, continued to focus on producing small batch beers for the local markets.

In addition to our owned brewing capacity, we continued to produce CBA beers in A-B’s Fort Collins, Colo. brewery. This partnership, which began in 2016, allows us to produce up to 300,000 barrels at this location annually.
Packaging
We package our craft beers in cans, bottles and kegs. All of our production breweries, with the exception of the Hawaii Brewery, have fully automated bottling and keg lines, and our Portsmouth, Portland, Boone, and Miami breweries each have canning capability. The bottle fillers at all of the breweries utilize a carbon dioxide environment during bottling, ensuring that minimal oxygen is dissolved in the beer and extending the beer’s shelf life. We offer an assortment of packages to highlight the unique characteristics of each of our beers and to provide greater opportunities for customers to drink our beers in more locations and at more events and occasions, matching the active lifestyles and preferences of our consumers. Additionally, in our Hawaii brewpub and Seattle brewpub, we package our small-batch and innovation beers for consumers in crowlers.
Quality Control
We monitor production and quality control at all of our breweries, with central coordination at the Oregon Brewery. All of the production breweries have an on-site laboratory where microbiologists and lab technicians supervise on-site yeast propagation, monitor product quality, test products, measure color and bitterness, and test for oxidation and unwanted bacteria. We also regularly utilize outside laboratories for independent product analysis. In addition, every batch of beer that we produce goes through an internal taste panel to ensure that it meets our taste and profile standards.
Ingredients and Raw Materials
We currently purchase a significant portion of our malted barley from two suppliers and our premium-quality select hops, mostly grown in the Pacific Northwest, from competitive sources. We also periodically purchase small lots of hops from international sources, such as New Zealand and Western Europe, which we use to achieve a special hop character in certain beers. In order to ensure the supply of the hop varieties used in our products, we enter into supply contracts for our hop requirements. We believe that comparable quality malted barley and hops are available from alternate sources at competitive prices, although there can be no assurance that pricing would be consistent with our current arrangements. We currently cultivate our own yeast supply for certain strains and maintain a separate, secure supply in-house. We have access to multiple competitive sources for packaging materials, such as labels, six-pack carriers, crowns, cans and shipping cases.
Contract Brewing
Strategically, we may enter into contract brewing arrangements under which we produce beer in volumes and per specifications as designated by the arrangements.
During 2019, we shipped 11,800 barrels under contract brewing arrangements, compared to 28,200 barrels in 2018 and 17,700 in 2017.
Innovation
In 2019, we launched The pH Experiment as a standalone business unit focused on quickly anticipating and identifying new trends in quenching drinkers’ thirst. The launch builds on the vast learnings and insights we amassed through a comprehensive consumer research effort in 2018 that included two research projects with global consultancy Prophet and the Yale Center for Customer Insights to help understand new segmentation strategies, and an in-house product testing initiative run by the pH Experiment. Combined with the ongoing learnings from our innovation breweries in Boone, Kailua-Kona, Miami, Portland, Portsmouth, and Seattle, we are committed to anticipating today’s changing consumer landscape to inform the evolution of our business model and portfolio.

Brewpubs Operations
We own and operate five brewpub restaurants and retail stores in our brewery home markets to support consumer awareness and research and development: two Kona brewpubs in Kailua-Kona and Oahu, Hawaii, one AMB brewpub in Boone, NC, one Redhook brewpub in Seattle, WA, and one Wynwood Brewing Co. brewpub in Miami, Florida. Our Cisco brewpub in Portsmouth is operated by the founders of Cisco Brewing to ensure it mirrors the original brewpub on Nantucket Island. These restaurants allow us to interact directly with over 1.5 million consumers annually in our home markets, which support brand awareness and trial. In addition, our brewers are continually experimenting with different varieties of hops and malts in all styles of beer, and our brewpubs allow us to bring those beers to market in test-size batches in order to evaluate their potential prior to releasing them on a wider basis.
Distribution
With limited exceptions, all brewers in the United States are required to sell their beers to independent wholesalers, who then sell the beers to retailers. We are the only independent craft brewer in the U.S. to have established a wholly aligned distribution network through our partnership with A-B. This partnership provides us national distribution, which results in both an effective distribution presence in each market and administrative efficiencies. Our beers are available for sale directly to consumers in draft, cans and bottles at restaurants, bars and liquor stores, as well as in cans and bottles at supermarkets, warehouse clubs, convenience stores and drug stores. We sell beer directly to consumers at our brewpubs and breweries.
We distribute in all 50 states, pursuant to a master distributor agreement with A-B that allows us access to A-B’s national distribution network. For additional information regarding our relationship with A-B, see “Relationship with Anheuser-Busch, LLC” below. Management believes that our competitors in the craft beer segment generally negotiate distribution relationships separately with wholesalers in each locality and, as a result, typically distribute through a variety of wholesalers representing differing national beer brands with uncoordinated territorial boundaries.
In 2019 and 2018, we sold approximately 645,400 barrels and 653,300 barrels, respectively, to the wholesalers in A-B’s distribution network, accounting for 88.0% and 87.4%, respectively, of our shipment volume for the corresponding periods.
Sales and Marketing
In addition to leveraging our owned brewpubs and retail locations, we promote our products through a national sales and marketing network that includes, but is not limited to, i) creating and executing a range of advertising programs; ii) training and educating wholesalers and retailers about our products; and iii) promoting our name, product offerings, brands, and experimental beers at local festivals, venues and brewpubs.
We advertise and promote our products through an assortment of media, including television, radio, billboard, print, digital and social media, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, in key markets and by participating in cooperative programs with our wholesalers. We believe that the financial commitment by the distributor helps align the distributor’s interests with ours, and the distributor’s knowledge of the local market results in an advertising and promotion program that is targeted in a manner that will best promote our products.
Our breweries also play a significant role in increasing consumer awareness of our products and enhancing our image as a craft brewer. Thousands of visitors take tours at our breweries each year and some of our production breweries have a retail restaurant or pub where our products are served. In addition, several of the breweries have meeting space that the public can rent for business meetings, parties and holiday events, and that we use to entertain and educate wholesalers, retailers and the media about our products. At our brewpubs, we sell various items of apparel and other merchandise bearing our trademarks, which creates further awareness of our beers and brands. To further promote retail canned and bottled product sales, and in response to local competitive conditions, we regularly recommend that wholesalers offer discounts to retailers in most of our markets.
Relationship with Anheuser-Busch, LLC
As a significant element of our business operations, we have entered into various contractual relationships with A-B as described in more detail below. With regard to agreements with A-B or one of its affiliates that provide for the payment of fees or other compensation in exchange for products or services, due to the related party nature of the agreements, the contract pricing may not be commensurate with amounts that an independent market participant would pay.

Agreement and Plan of Merger
On November 11, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with ABC and Barrel Subsidiary, Inc., a Washington corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of ABC (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into CBA (the “Merger”), with CBA continuing as the surviving entity in the Merger as a direct subsidiary of ABC.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each issued and outstanding share of common stock of CBA (the “Shares”) (other than (i) Shares owned by ABC, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ABC and Shares owned by us or any of our direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (ii) Shares that are owned by shareholders of CBA (other than ABC, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ABC) who did not vote in favor of the Merger Agreement or the Merger and who exercise dissenters’ rights when and in the manner required by Washington law) will be converted into the right to receive $16.50 per Share in cash, without any interest.
The completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions, including (i) the approval of the Merger Agreement by a majority of all of the outstanding Shares, as well as the approval of the Merger Agreement by holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares not held by ABC or any of its affiliates, which approval was received on February 25, 2020, (ii) the expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods under the federal antitrust laws, (iii) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the Merger, and (iv) certain other customary conditions relating to the parties’ representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and the performance of their respective obligations. The Merger is not subject to approval by the shareholders of ABC or to any financing condition, and ABC and Merger Sub made representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement that they have, and will have at the Effective Time, available to them cash and other sources of immediately available funds sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration and all other cash amounts payable in connection with the closing pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties made by us and ABC, and also contains customary pre-closing covenants, including covenants, among others, by us to (i) operate our businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and to refrain from taking certain actions without ABC’s consent and (ii) not solicit, initiate, propose, knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate any third-party proposals for a competing takeover proposal and, subject to certain exceptions, not to participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person making any proposal for an alternative transaction, as well as certain pre-closing covenants by us, ABC and Merger Sub, including a covenant to use reasonable best efforts to obtain governmental and third-party approvals, subject to certain limitations specified in the Merger Agreement.The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights, including (i) in the event that the parties mutually agree to termination, (ii) by either us or ABC, if the Merger is not consummated on or before November 11, 2020 (the “Outside Date”), with either party having the right to extend to February 11, 2021, if antitrust clearance has not been received, and with either party having the right to extend further to May 11, 2021 if antitrust clearance has not been received, (iii) by either us or ABC, if any law or order permanently prohibits consummation of the Merger, (iv) by either us or ABC, if the other party is in breach of its respective representations and warranties or covenants under the Merger Agreement such that a closing condition is not satisfied (subject to notice and cure and other customary exceptions), (v) by us, in order to enter into an agreement providing for a superior alternative transaction, or (vi) by us, if (1) any court or other governmental authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated or entered any permanent or temporary order but with an extension or lapse date that is on or after the date that is three business days prior to the Outside Date and (2) ABC determines at any point to drop any appeal of such order or to cease any efforts to resist any action seeking to block or enjoin consummation of the Merger.
In connection with the Merger, CBA and ABC filed notification and report forms under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”) with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) on December 6, 2019. ABC subsequently withdrew its HSR Act filing, and refiled it on January 6, 2020.
On February 5, 2020, CBA and ABC each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (the “Second Request”) from the DOJ in connection with the DOJ’s review of the Merger. The effect of the Second Request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act until 30 days after CBA and ABC have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the DOJ. Both parties continue to work cooperatively with the DOJ in its review. 
On February 25, 2020, the Merger Agreement was adopted by a majority of the shares of CBA common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, including a majority of the shares held by shareholders other than ABC and its affiliates.

Index

Completion of the Merger is expected to occur in 2020 and remains subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and the satisfaction or waiver of the other closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement provides that, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including as a result of a change in the recommendation of CBA's board of directors, CBA will be required to pay to ABC a termination fee equal to $9.0 million in cash. ABC will be required to pay a termination fee equal to $15.0 million in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated due to failure to satisfy the antitrust-related conditions. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 12, 2019.
Distributor Agreement
The Master A-B Distributor Agreement (the "A-B Distributor Agreement"), as amended in August 2016, provides for the distribution of our brands in all states, territories and possessions of the United States, including the District of Columbia and, except with respect to Kona beers, all U.S. military, diplomatic, and governmental installations in a U.S. territory or possession. Under the A-B Distributor Agreement, we have granted A-B the right of first refusal to distribute our products, including any internally developed new products, but excluding new products that we may acquire. We are responsible for marketing our products to A-B’s wholesalers, as well as to retailers and consumers.
As amended in August 2016, the term of the A-B Distributor Agreement will expire on December 31, 2028, unless terminated earlier as a result of the Merger or otherwise. The A-B Distributor Agreement is also subject to immediate termination, by either party, upon the occurrence of standard events of default as defined in the agreement. Additionally, the A-B Distributor Agreement may be terminated by A-B, with six months’ prior written notice to us, upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

• | we engage in incompatible conduct that damages the reputation or image of A‑B or the brewing industry;


• | any A-B competitor or affiliate thereof acquires 10% or more of our outstanding equity securities, and that entity designates one or more persons to our board of directors;


• | our current chief executive officer ceases to function in that role or is terminated, and a satisfactory successor, in A‑B’s opinion, is not appointed within six months;


• | we are merged or consolidated into or with any other entity or any other entity merges or consolidates into or with us without A-B’s prior approval; or


• | A-B, its subsidiaries, affiliates, or parent, incur any obligation or expense as a result of a claim asserted against them by or in our name, or by our affiliates or shareholders, and we do not reimburse and indemnify A-B and its corporate affiliates on demand for the entire amount of the obligation or expense.

Under the A-B Distributor Agreement, we pay $0.25 per case-equivalent as a margin fee. In addition, since January 1, 2019, we have been required to reinvest an aggregate amount equal to $0.25 per case-equivalent in sales and marketing efforts for our products. 
International Distribution Agreement
On August 23, 2016, we also entered into an International Distribution Agreement (the “International Distribution Agreement”) with Anheuser-Busch Worldwide Investments, LLC (“ABWI”), an affiliate of A-B, pursuant to which ABWI is the sole and exclusive distributor of our malt beverage products in jurisdictions outside the United States, subject to the terms and conditions of our agreement with our other international distributor, CraftCan Travel LLC, and certain other limitations, in each case as set forth in the International Distribution Agreement. Under the International Distribution Agreement, following delivery of notice to us, ABWI may also elect to commence brewing outside of the United States some or all of the products to be distributed in the non-U.S. jurisdictions covered by the International Distribution Agreement. 
Under the terms of the International Distribution Agreement, with respect to our exported products produced by us, ABWI pays us our costs of production plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating to export shipment costs. Additionally, ABWI pays us an international royalty fee based on volume of our products sold by ABWI, equal to either $40 per barrel or $30 per barrel, depending on certain factors described in the International Distribution Agreement, which royalty fee is subject to escalation annually, beginning in calendar year 2018, on the terms described in the International Distribution Agreement. A-B has also paid us fees totaling $34.0 million recognized in Beer Related Net sales on a straight-line basis over the 10-year contract term.
The International Distribution Agreement contains specified termination rights, including, among other things, the right of either party to terminate the International Distribution Agreement if (a) the other party fails to perform any material obligation under the International Distribution Agreement, subject to certain cure rights or (b) the Brewing Agreement (as defined below) is terminated pursuant to certain specified provisions thereof. Unless terminated sooner, including upon completion of the Merger, the International Distribution Agreement will continue in effect until December 31, 2026.

Contract Brewing Arrangements
On August 23, 2016, we entered into a Contract Brewing Agreement (the “Brewing Agreement”) with A-B Commercial Strategies, LLC (“ABCS”), an affiliate of A-B, pursuant to which ABCS will brew, bottle and package up to 300,000 barrels of our mutually agreed products annually, in facilities owned by ABCS within the United States, for an initial term through December 31, 2026. Production of CBA's products in ABCS’s brewery in Fort Collins, Colorado, began in the second quarter of 2017. We share equally with ABCS in any cost savings arising from the Brewing Agreement, provided that our cost savings will equal at least $10.00 per barrel on an aggregate basis, following certain adjustments as set forth in the Brewing Agreement. The Brewing Agreement provides specified termination rights, including, among other things, the right of either party to terminate the Brewing Agreement if (i) the other party fails to perform any material obligation under the Brewing Agreement, subject to certain cure rights, (ii) the International Distribution Agreement (as defined above) is terminated pursuant to certain specified provisions thereof, or (iii) subject to certain conditions, if the A-B Distributor Agreement (as defined above) is terminated pursuant to certain specified provisions thereof.
Exchange Agreement
We have also entered into an Amended and Restated Exchange and Recapitalization Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with A-B, pursuant to which we have granted A-B certain contractual rights. The Exchange Agreement originally was entered into in 2004 as part of a recapitalization in which we redeemed preferred shares held by A-B in exchange for cash and the shares of our common stock currently held by A-B. A-B owned 6,069,047 shares, or approximately 31.1%, of our outstanding shares of common stock at December 31, 2019.
The Exchange Agreement entitles A-B to designate two members of our board of directors. A-B also generally has the right to have a designee on each committee of the board of directors, except where prohibited by law or stock exchange requirements, or with respect to a committee formed to evaluate transactions or proposed transactions between A-B and us. The Exchange Agreement contains limitations on our ability to take certain actions without A-B’s prior consent, including, but not limited to, our ability to issue equity securities or acquire or sell assets or stock, amend our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, grant board representation rights, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, distribute our products in the United States other than through A-B or as provided in the A-B Distributor Agreement, or voluntarily terminate our listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Fees
We pay fees to A-B in connection with the sale of our products, including margin fees, invoicing, staging and cooperage handling fees, and inventory manager fees. In addition, our contract brewing arrangements call for the payment of fees to the respective brewing partner, and A-B pays us distribution costs and fees and royalty fees under the International Distribution Agreement.
See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.
Seasonality
Our sales generally reflect a degree of seasonality, with the first and fourth quarters historically exhibiting low sales levels compared to the second and third quarters. Accordingly, our results for any particular quarter are not likely to be indicative of the results to be achieved for the full year.
Competition
We compete in the craft brewing market, as well as in the much larger alcohol beverage market, which encompasses domestic and imported beers, flavored alcohol beverages, spirits, wine, hard ciders and hard seltzers. We are also monitoring the impact of marijuana as more states continue to pass legalization. With the proliferation of variety and offerings, we are also seeing more and more consumers being less loyal to individual brands as they favor sampling a wider spectrum of alcohol beverages in a single occasion.
In 2019, the craft brewing industry continued to experience unprecedented change and competition, characterized by three trends: 1) the growing number and popularity of local craft breweries; 2) continued acquisition and investment activity between craft brewers, large domestic and foreign brewers, and private equity firms; and 3) new category entrants like hard seltzer, which captured market share from both craft and bigger beer. 
Competition varies by regional market. Depending on the local market preferences and distribution, we have encountered strong competition from microbreweries, regional specialty brewers and national craft brewers such as MillerCoors’ Tenth and Blake 
13

Index

Beer Company division (“Tenth and Blake”), Constellation Brands, and A-B’s craft division. A-B’s craft division includes Goose Island, Blue Point Brewing, 10 Barrel Brewing Company, Elysian, Golden Road, Shock Top, Karbach Brewing, Devil's Backbone and others. Because of the large number of participants and offerings in this segment, along with the accelerating consumer preference for local offerings and lighter, “better for you” options such as hard seltzer, the competition for packaged product placements and especially draft beer placements has intensified. Although certain of these competitors distribute their products nationally and may have greater financial and other resources than we have, we believe that we possess certain competitive advantages. Our unique portfolio strategy combines strong national lifestyle brands with distinctive regional craft brands, supported by the scale and specialization of our production breweries, strategically distributed sales and marketing resources, and alignment within the A-B distribution network.
We also compete against imported brands, such as Heineken, Stella Artois, Corona Extra and Guinness, which typically have significantly greater financial resources than we have. Although imported beers currently account for a greater share of the U.S. beer market than craft beers, we believe that craft brewers possess certain competitive advantages over some importers, including lower transportation costs, no importation costs, proximity to and familiarity with local consumers, a higher degree of product freshness, eligibility for lower federal excise taxes and absence of exposure to currency fluctuations.
Competition for consumers of craft beers also comes from wine and spirits, which reflects today’s millennial consumers who typically drink across alcohol beverage categories in a single drinking occasion. Growth in this segment appears to be attributable to competitive pricing, targeted advertising, increased merchandising and greater consumer interest in local products. In the past, the wine industry has been aided, on a limited basis, by its ability to sell outside of the three-tier system, allowing sales to be made directly to consumers. While the craft beer segment competes with wine and spirits, it also benefits from many of the same advantages enjoyed by wine and spirit producers, including consumers who allow themselves affordable luxuries in the form of high quality alcohol beverages.
Recently, several major distilled spirits producers and national brewers have introduced flavored alcohol beverages, such as hard seltzers, which have captured sizable market share in the higher-priced end of the malt beverage industry. These products are particularly popular in certain regions and markets in which we sell our products. In response to consumer demand for these products, we have introduced our own line of hard seltzers.
A significant portion of our sales volume continues to be in the Pacific Northwest and in California, which we believe are among the most competitive craft beer markets in the U.S., both in terms of number of participants and consumer awareness. We believe that these areas offer significant competition for our products, not only from other craft brewers but also from the growing wine market and from hard seltzers and flavored alcohol beverages. Additionally, we are monitoring the impact of cannabis as more states legalize marijuana for retail sales. Our recent marketing efforts have been focused on promoting the national relevance of Kona as a leading lifestyle brand, the authenticity of our pioneering regional brands, along with better segmenting our marketing strategies to communicate the attributes of our portfolio to our target consumers. We believe that our broad array of beers and brands enables us to offer an assortment of flavors and experiences that appeal to more people.
Segment and Enterprise-Wide Information
See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for the required segment and enterprise-wide information.
Regulation
Our business is highly regulated at federal, state and local levels. Various permits, licenses and approvals necessary for our brewery, wineries and pub operations and the sale of alcoholic beverages are required from a number of agencies, including the U.S. Treasury Department, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (“TTB”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the FDA, state alcohol regulatory agencies, and state and local health, sanitation, safety, fire and environmental agencies. In addition, the beer industry is subject to substantial federal and state excise taxes.
The FDA issued a proposed rule in November 2015 on the use of “gluten-free” labeling for fermented and hydrolyzed foods and beverages that may affect our ability to market our Omission Beer as “crafted to reduce gluten.” A final rule has not been issued. While the rule remains on FDA’s Federal Agenda, it appears adoption will continue to be delayed under the current administration’s executive order to reduce and freeze new regulations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.
We operate our breweries, and wineries to produce hard cider, under federal licensing requirements imposed by the TTB. The TTB requires the filing of a “Brewer’s Notice” upon the establishment of a commercial brewery and the filing of an amended Brewer’s Notice whenever there is a material change in the brewing or warehousing locations, brewing or packaging equipment,

Index

brewery ownership, or officers or directors. The TTB requires us to obtain a winery permit and registration for each facility that produces hard cider. Our operations are subject to audit and inspection by the TTB at any time. In 2019, the TTB conducted an audit of our Federal excise tax returns and related operation for the period of March 1, 2016 to October 31, 2018. The audit was completed on August 1, 2019 and all outstanding matters resolved by December 18, 2019. 
Management believes that we have all the licenses, permits and approvals required for our current operations. Existing permits or licenses could be revoked if we fail to comply with the terms of such permits or licenses and additional permits or licenses may be required in the future for our current operations or because of expanding our operations.
Beginning January 1, 2018, the federal excise taxes imposed on domestic brewers that produce less than 2 million barrels annually, were reduced from $7.00 to $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels shipped annually and from $18.00 to $16.00 per barrel on the first 6 million barrels shipped annually for all other brewers and all beer importers. Barrels shipped in excess of 6 million barrels in a given year continue to be subject to a federal excise tax of $18 per barrel on beer sold for consumption in the United States. Certain states also levy excise taxes on alcoholic beverages but are usually paid by the wholesaler. Also, while the existing excise tax on hard cider did not change from $0.226 per gallon, the small producer tax credit for hard cider was expanded to $0.062 on the first 30,000 gallons for an effective rate of $0.164 per gallon; the tax credit on the next 100,000 gallons produced became $0.056 for an effective rate of $0.17 per gallon; and producers like us who produce between 130,000 and 750,000 gallons of hard cider annually receive a $0.033 credit for an effective tax rate of $0.193 per gallon. We pay excise taxes in states where we produce (Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Florida).
The reductions in federal excise taxes described above were set to expire at the end of 2019, but due to the efforts of the Beer Institute, of which we are a member, and other industry groups, the provisions in the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform were extended through December 31, 2020. Efforts among the industry will continue this year to make this federal excise tax relief for all brewers and beer importers wineries (and distilleries) permanent. Excise taxes may be increased in the future by the federal government or any state government or both. In the past, increases in excise taxes on alcoholic beverages have been considered in connection with various governmental budget-balancing or funding proposals.
Federal and State Environmental Regulation
Our brewing and winery operations are subject to environmental regulations and local permitting requirements and agreements regarding, among other things, air emissions, water discharges and the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes. While we have no reason to believe the operation of our breweries violates any such regulation or requirement, if such a violation were to occur, or if environmental regulations were to become more stringent in the future, we could be adversely affected.
Dram Shop Laws
The serving of alcoholic beverages to a person known to be intoxicated may, under certain circumstances, result in the server being held liable to third parties for injuries caused by the intoxicated customer. Our restaurants and brewpubs have addressed this issue by maintaining reasonable hours of operation and routinely performing training for personnel.
Trademarks
We have obtained U.S. trademark registrations for numerous products. Trademark registrations generally include brand names and logos and specific product names. The Kona Brewing Co., Widmer Brothers Brewing, Redhook, and Omission marks and certain other marks are also registered in various foreign countries. We regard our Kona, Widmer Brothers, Redhook, Omission, Square Mile, Cisco, AMB, Wynwood and other trademarks as having substantial value and as being an important factor in the marketing of our products. We also have several similar international trademarks. We are not aware of any infringing uses that could materially affect our current business or any prior claim to the trademarks that would prevent us from using such trademarks in our business. Our policy is to pursue registration of our material trademarks in our markets whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our trademarks.
Employees
At December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 655 people, including 270 employees in the brewpubs and retail stores, 155 employees in production, 146 employees in sales and marketing and 84 employees in corporate and administration. Included in the totals above are 155 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a union or employed under a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relations with our employees to be good.
