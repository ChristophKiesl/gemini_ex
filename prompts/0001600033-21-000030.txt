Item 1. Business. 
Overview
e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (“e.l.f. Beauty” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” or “we”) is a multi-brand beauty company that offers inclusive, accessible, cruelty-free cosmetics and skin-care products. Our mission is to make the best of beauty accessible to every eye, lip and face. 
We believe our ability to deliver 100% cruelty-free, premium-quality products at accessible prices with broad appeal differentiates us in the beauty industry. We believe the combination of our fundamental value equation, digitally-led strategy, as well as our world-class team’s ability to execute with speed has positioned us well to navigate a rapidly changing landscape in beauty. 
Our family of brands includes e.l.f. Cosmetics, W3LL PEOPLE and Keys Soulcare. Our brands are available online and across leading beauty, mass-market, and clean-beauty specialty retailers. We have strong relationships with our retail partners such as Walmart, Target, Ulta Beauty and other leading retailers that have enabled us to expand distribution both domestically and internationally.
Our Brands
Each of our brands is positioned to touch diverse consumer cohorts at different price points. All three of our brands have accessible pricing relative to their competitive set and further our mission of making the best of beauty accessible to every eye, lip and face. Below is a chart of our brands and how we view them based on distribution and price point:

e.l.f. Cosmetics makes the best of beauty accessible to every eye, lip and face by offering high-quality, prestige-inspired cosmetics and skincare products at an extraordinary value, all formulated 100% vegan and cruelty-free. 
W3LL PEOPLE is a clean beauty pioneer, raising the standard for high-performance, plant-powered, cruelty-free cosmetics since 2008. W3LL PEOPLE's product-line includes 35+ EWG VERIFIED™ products, a leading standard of “clean and healthy” in the beauty space. 
Keys Soulcare is a lifestyle beauty brand created with artist, producer, actress, and New York Times best-selling author Alicia Keys. With an inclusive point of view, an authentic voice and a line of skin-loving, dermatologist-developed, cruelty-free offerings, Keys Soulcare aims to bring new meaning to beauty by honoring ritual in our daily life and practicing intention in every action.

100% cruelty-free: We do not conduct or tolerate any tests on animals, nor do we use any ingredients that are tested on animals in any of its products. Each of our brands is certified by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) as “Global Animal Test-Free”, a label given to companies and brands who have verified that their own facilities and their suppliers do not conduct, commission, pay for, or allow any tests on animals for their ingredients, formulations, or finished products. e.l.f. Cosmetics is also certified by PETA as “Global Animal Test-Free and Vegan”, which recognizes companies and brands that not only ban animal tests but also refuse to use any animal-derived ingredients, such as honey, beeswax, or carmine in its products.
Clean ingredients: Our products are formulated with ingredients that have the health and safety of our consumers in mind. All products are formulated to meet Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") and European Union Cosmetic Regulation restrictions for over 1,600 ingredients including parabens, phthalates, sulfates, formaldehyde, nonylphenol ethoxylates, triclosan, triclocarban, toluene, coal tar, lead, mercury, acrylamide and hydroquinone as well as other substances. Additionally, W3LL PEOPLE's product-line includes 35+ EWG VERIFIED™ products, a leading standard of “clean and healthy” in the beauty space. 
Marketing & Digital
We deploy a consumer-centric marketing model. We build brand equity and drive traffic to our national retailer partners and to our own e-commerce websites and mobile applications primarily through digital and social media, as compared to legacy beauty brands that often seek to engage consumers through traditional media such as magazines, newspapers and television. Total expenses for marketing and digital in the year ended March 31, 2021 were $49.7 million, approximately 16% of our net sales.
Our consumers have been our best advocates through strong word of mouth. Many of our consumers are active in social media, write reviews of our products online and generate content on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube and other social media platforms. We had nearly 12 million followers on social media and through our Beauty Squad program as of March 31, 2021.
Innovation
We believe innovation is key to our success and that we are a leader in the industry in speed and first to mass product introductions. We have built an innovation capability that can progress a new, high-quality product from concept to online launch in as few as 13 weeks and 20 weeks on average. We leverage multiple sources of inspiration to develop our new product ideas, including global trend assessments, supplier and industry research, strategic customer input and consumer feedback and insights. 
Our innovation strategy is underpinned by four key pillars:
•Holy Grails. “Holy grails” are beauty products that deliver premium quality at unbelievable prices with broad appeal. As consumers are increasingly savvy and knowledgeable about trends in the prestige market, they look for ways to get the best of beauty at an accessible price. Examples of our “holy grails” include the e.l.f. Cosmetics Poreless Putty Primer at $9 versus a comparable prestige primer at $52, the e.l.f. Cosmetics 16HR Camo Concealer at $6 versus a comparable prestige concealer at $27, and the W3LL PEOPLE Expressionist Pro Mascara at $19 versus a comparable clean prestige mascara at $28.
•Core Improvement. We consistently evaluate our core offerings to develop new products or improve quality based on category trends, consumer feedback, and other market intelligence. We launch trend-inspired, core expansion products that augment our assortment and deliver extraordinary value across price points. We also evaluate quality improvement opportunities with our product assortment, such as reformulating existing products with cleaner ingredients. 
•Adjacencies. We believe that we can reapply our model to launch products into adjacent product categories outside of color cosmetics. For example, Keys Soulcare’s initial product collection introduced in early calendar year 2021 included nine dermatologist-developed clean offerings in the skin care category. 
•Collaborations & Collections. We utilize collaborations and collections to build brand awareness and showcase our brands’ abilities to connect with, surprise and delight consumers while creating buzz-generating moments. For example, in the year ended March 31, 2021, e.l.f. Cosmetics launched a collaboration with Chipotle on a limited edition makeup collection. We also utilize exclusive collections with our national retailers, such as e.l.f. Cosmetics’ Mint Melt collection which was available exclusively at Walmart in the United States, at Superdrug in the United Kingdom, and at DM stores in Germany. 
Markets and Competition
The color cosmetics category primarily consists of face makeup, eye makeup, lip products, nail products and cosmetics sets/kits, along with beauty tools and accessories such as brushes and applicators. The skin care category primarily consists of facial skin care and eye skin care products. Color cosmetics and skin care products are broadly sold through food, drug and mass channels, as well as through department stores and direct and specialty channels. 
The color cosmetics and skin care categories are relatively concentrated, with a significant portion of retail sales in the United States generated by brands owned by a few large multinational companies, such as L’Oreal, Estee Lauder, Coty, Revlon, Shiseido, Johnson & Johnson, and Procter & Gamble. These large multinational companies typically own multiple brands. In addition to the traditional brands against which we compete, small independent companies continue to enter the market with new brands and customized product offerings.
Distribution 
We employ an omni-channel distribution strategy and sell our products online through our own direct e-commerce channels, and with national retailers in the United States, as well as internationally. Our main channels of distribution are described below.
•National retailers.    We sell our products in the United States primarily in the mass, drug store, food and specialty retail channels.
•e-commerce.   Our e-commerce platforms are an important component of our engagement and innovation model. Our roots as an e-commerce company and our digital engagement model drive conversion on our e-commerce websites and our mobile applications, where we sell our full product offerings.
•International.    Our products are also sold in a number of international markets, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and China.
Customers
Along with our direct e-commerce channels, we have strong relationships with our retail partners such as Walmart, Target, Ulta Beauty and other leading retailers that have enabled us to expand distribution both domestically and internationally.
Walmart and Target accounted for 26% and 22%, respectively, of our net sales in the year ended March 31, 2021. No other individual customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in the year ended March 31, 2021. We expect that Walmart and Target and a small number of other customers will, in the aggregate, continue to account for a large portion of our net sales in the future. 
As is customary in the industry, none of our customers is under an obligation to continue purchasing products from us in the future.
For more information regarding customer concentration, see Part II, Item 7 “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this report under the heading “Overview.”
Supply Chain
We have developed a scalable, asset-light supply chain centered on speed to market and high-quality at low cost. Substantially all of our products are sourced and manufactured in China through close collaboration with a network of third-party manufacturers. We have ample manufacturing capacity as well as redundant capabilities in the event that one or more suppliers cannot meet our needs. Our broad supply base gives us the ability to fulfill our product requirements and remain cost competitive.
We work closely with our suppliers on new product innovation and quality. Our China-based sourcing, quality and innovation teams work with their U.S.-based counterparts to deliver ongoing product quality, innovation and cost savings. We are not overly dependent on any single raw material. The raw materials used in our products are broadly available and have regular quality testing for ingredient integrity. 
We operate two main distribution centers: one in Ontario, California, which mainly serves our national retail customers, and one in Columbus, Ohio, which mainly services our e-commerce consumers. We have invested capital in picking, packaging, scanning, and conveying technology to more fully automate our processes. Our Ontario and Columbus distribution centers are both operated by a leading third-party logistics provider. For our international operations, we utilize third-party logistics providers in Canada and the United Kingdom to distribute to certain international customers and distributors.
Human Capital Management
We are led by our purpose—we stand with every eye, lip, face and paw—and our employees are at the core of our business strategy. As of March 31, 2021, we had 267 full-time employees (191 in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, and 76 in China) and 21 part-time employees and interns.
Culture and Commitments
By standing with every eye, lip, face and paw, we are committed to creating a culture internally—and in the world around us—where all individuals are encouraged to express their truest selves, are empowered to succeed, and where we strive to do the right thing for people, the planet and our furry friends. We are committed to:
•    Encourage Self Expression. We celebrate diversity and make the best of beauty accessible. 
•    Empower Others. We provide equal opportunities for growth and success. 
•    Embody Our Ethics. We strive to do the right thing for all people, the planet and our furry friends. 
In the year ended March 31, 2021, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we also implemented a range of initiatives to support the safety and well-being of our employees and community. 
 Encourage Self Expression: Promoting a Culture of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion. Our mission is to make the best of beauty accessible to every eye, lip and face and we believe it is important that our team reflects the diverse consumers we serve. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion starts at the top with a highly skilled and diverse board of directors. We promote diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels of our workforce, and our senior leadership team takes full ownership of and responsibility for our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and programs. 
We are proud of our workforce demographics and are committed to ensuring that appropriate levels of diversity – including but not limited to gender, race, sexual orientation, national origin, ability, and age – are represented across our entire team. 
The following table provides certain statistics of our team as of March 31, 2021:

 | Board of Directors(1) | Senior Leadership(2) | All Employees(3)
Female | 56% | 43% | 77% 
Black or African American | 22% | 14% | 8% 
Hispanic or LatinX | —% | —% | 14% 
Asian | 11% | 29% | 15% 
Native American | —% | —% | 1% 
Two or More Races | —% | —% | 5% 
White | 67% | 57% | 58% 


(1) | Excludes Sabrina Simmons, who notified us on March 26, 2021 of her decision to resign from the board of directors and all committees thereof, effective May 31, 2021.
(2) | Senior Leadership includes our Executive Officers and the Vice President, General Manager of our China operations. 
(3) | Includes our employees in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, where over 70% of our workforce is located. 

We believe that to drive change there must be continuous education, learning and sharing. We require all employees to participate in unconscious bias training, so that we might learn how to recognize potential bias in our thoughts and actions. We host open forums with our senior leadership to share and encourage uncomfortable conversations. Additionally, we regularly host education events for our employees to lean into cultural moments, such as Black History Month; International Women’s Month; Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month; Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) Pride Month; and LatinX Heritage Month.
Empower Others: Supporting the Full Potential of Our Employees
Our talented employees are at the core of our business strategy. We place a high priority on attracting, recruiting, developing and retaining diverse global talent. Our benefits and programs are designed to support the total well-being and promote the full potential of our employees. 
With regards to compensation, we take a “one-team” approach. Every employee receives a base salary, is bonus eligible under the same bonus target tied to our financial performance, and receives an equity award. We believe this approach – which applies across all employee levels and geographies – is unique in the beauty industry and contributes to our success in hiring and retaining top talent and driving business results.
In the United States, where over 70% of our workforce is located, the benefits for our full-time employees include, among other things: 
• Financial benefits, including competitive compensation as well as retirement savings plans and commuter benefits;
• Healthcare benefits including flexible spending accounts, disability and life insurance;
• Family support and flexibility benefits including up to 20 weeks of parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child as well as the placement of a foster child, as well as fertility and adoption support;
• Wellness and time off programs including an employee assistance program, access to wellness coaches and paid time off;
• Community impact programs including volunteer time off and donation matching programs; 
• Education and career development programs including high performance teamwork coaching, as well as ongoing learning and training opportunities; and
• Other benefits, such as “Pawternity Leave” for the adoption of a shelter animal.
Outside of the United States, we provide similarly competitive benefit packages to those of our United States employees but tailored to market-specific practices.
Embody Our Ethics: Doing the Right Thing for All People, the Planet and Our Furry Friends
All People
We proudly support human rights and individual expression and freedom. As such, we ensure our employees have their rights respected, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, religion, abilities or sexual orientation. We also expect our suppliers and partners to observe these principles when providing products and services to us. 
The Planet
We are committed to minimizing our environmental impact while providing our consumers with premium-quality beauty products. In the year ended March 31, 2021, we celebrated a significant milestone on our sustainability journey – eliminating an estimated 650,000 pounds of packaging waste since the inception of "Project Unicorn". Project Unicorn was designed to elevate e.l.f. Cosmetics’ product assortment, presentation, and navigation on-shelf, and resulted in a significant streamlining in our packaging footprint. The elimination of packaging waste was achieved by removing secondary cartons, vacuum formed trays and paper insert cards, slimming down secondary packaging, and designing a patented approach to display product on shelf. 
Our Furry Friends
We are proud to be a 100% cruelty-free company. We do not conduct or tolerate any tests on animals, nor do we use any ingredients that are tested on animals in any of our products. Each of our brands is certified by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) as “Global Animal Test-Free”, a label given to companies and brands who have verified that their own facilities and their suppliers do not conduct, commission, pay for, or allow any tests on animals for their ingredients, formulations, or finished products. 
Our COVID-19 Response
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our first priority has been the safety and well-being of our employees and community. In response to COVID-19, we sent safety kits with gloves, hand sanitizers, and disinfectant wipes to all of our employees, and included a free hand sanitizer with consumer orders placed online at elfcosmetics.com. We also gave each employee an addition of $1,000 to their regular paychecks to help defray some of the costs of supplies and delivery services, child and family care needs. Additionally, we donated $25,000 to local community food bank organizations to help feed those in need. 
Seasonality
Our results of operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters typically being higher than in the first and second fiscal quarters. The higher net sales in our third and fourth fiscal quarters are largely attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday season and customer shelf reset activity, respectively. Lower holiday purchases or shifts in customer shelf reset activity could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. To support anticipated higher sales during the third and fourth fiscal quarters, we make investments in working capital to ensure inventory levels can support demand. Fluctuations throughout the year are also driven by the timing of product restocking or rearrangement by our major retail customers as well as expansion into new retail customers. Because a limited number of our retail customers account for a large percentage 
of our net sales, a change in the order pattern of one or more of our large retail customers could cause a significant fluctuation of our quarterly results or impact our liquidity.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our primary trademarks include “e.l.f.,” “e.l.f. eyes lips face,” “W3LL PEOPLE,” and “Keys Soulcare” all of which are registered or have registrations pending in the United States with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for our goods and services of primary interest. These trademarks are also registered or have registrations pending in many other countries or registries. We also have other trademark registrations and pending applications for product names and tag lines. Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce the distinctiveness of our brands and our consumers’ favorable perception of our products. In addition to trademark protection, we own U.S. Design Patents covering packaging, make-up tools and brush handle shapes and we own numerous domain names, including the domains of our e-commerce websites. We also rely on and use reasonable business activities to protect unpatented proprietary expertise and product formulations, continuing innovation and other know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Government Regulation
We and our products are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations, including regulation in the United States by the FDA, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”), the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), and regulations outside of the United States by Health Canada and the European Commission, among others. These laws and regulations principally relate to the ingredients, proper labeling, advertising, packaging, marketing, manufacture, safety, shipment and disposal of our products. Further, as the vast majority of our products are imported from overseas manufacturers, we are subject to Customs Border Patrol clearance regulations prior to goods being released into the United States market.
We are also subject to a number of federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, including regulations related to consumer protection, the promotion and sale of merchandise, privacy, use and protection of consumer and employee personal information and data (including the collection of data from minors), behavioral tracking, and advertising and marketing activities (including sweepstakes, contests and giveaways).
Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we operate and may significantly increase our compliance costs. For information regarding the risks related to the laws and regulations to which we are subject, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk factors”.
Expenditures for Environmental Compliance
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, provincial, state, municipal and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and environmental protection, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to land and surface waters, generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, and the registration and evaluation of chemicals. We maintain policies and procedures to monitor and control environmental, health and safety risks, and to monitor compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements. Compliance with such laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 
Segments
We operate our business as a single operating and reportable segment. For more information regarding segment reporting, see Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 “Exhibits, financial statement schedules” under the heading “Segment reporting.”
Geographic Information
For information regarding the geographic source of our net sales and the location of our long-lived assets, see Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 “Exhibits, financial statement schedules” under the heading “Segment reporting.” For information regarding the risks related to our non-U.S. operations, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk factors.”
