Business Strategy
 
Eco Innovation Group, Inc. is a socially responsible and sustainability-focused technology incubator devoted to the commercialization of select intellectual property that, given the right business platform, has the potential to achieve high-value commercial success. Our value creation strategy is a strategic approach to environmental sustainability: we seek innovative socially responsible products and technologies with the potential to create globally important paradigm shifts in energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. Consistent with our strategy, we seek to license, develop and market environmentally sustainable and socially responsible technologies that have compelling market potential.
Market Opportunity 
 We believe our strategic approach to environmental sustainability and socially responsible technology development offers an attractive value proposition. Environmental sustainability and social responsibility are at the core of a rapidly growing target market recognized for its growth prospects, driven by consumer preference, competitive imperative, regulatory impacts, investor mandates and capital markets. Consumers, both individual and institutional, are core to the change.
 According to a report published by Deloitte in February 2020, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing is rapidly growing in major global economies and capital markets. As reported by Deloitte, ESG-mandated assets in the United States could grow almost three times as fast as non-ESG-mandated assets to comprise half of all professionally managed investments by 2025, and an estimated 200 new funds in the United States with an ESG investment mandate are expected to launch over the next three years, more than doubling the activity from the previous three years. Also, the Governance and Accountability Institute suggested that 86% of S&P 500 companies published sustainability reports in 2018 – up from 20% in 2011. Studies conducted by NYU Stern and Bank of America reported that consumers are also increasingly looking to align themselves with sustainable companies that serve a greater social purpose.
 In our approach to the Company’s market opportunity, we not only look for great people with great technology, as part of our nine-step “Evaluation to Market” discipline, we also look to choose scalable technology opportunities and to maximize profit margins.

Our Technology Agreements
 
JouleBox® Power Station Contract Manufacturing Agreement
 
On August 25, 2020, the Company signed a Master Outsourcing Contract Manufacturing Agreement with Eco-Gen Energy, Inc. (“Eco-Gen”), pursuant to which the Company has contracted to manage the production and delivery of Eco-Gen’s JouleBox® Power Station. The Master Outsourcing Contract Manufacturing Agreement with Eco-Gen is a related party transaction insofar as our CEO and controlling Stockholder, Julia Otey-Raudes, is a director and shareholder of Eco-Gen, and in that the Company’s offices are provided to the Company by Eco-Gen in a space located within Eco-Gen’s corporate offices. Our CEO and controlling Stockholder, Julia Otey-Raudes, owns 20.66% of Eco-Gen’s outstanding voting stock as of the date of this amended Prospectus.
 
Under the Eco-Gen agreement, the Company has contracted to provide material purchase and management services, supply base management services, final product and component production services, delivery services, inventory management services, and related financial services for the production and delivery of Eco-Gen’s JouleBox® Power Station. Pursuant to an addendum to this Eco-Gen agreement dated August 26, 2020, Eco-Gen is required to advance payment to the Company prior to the Company’s performance of these services with relation to Eco-Gen’s clients. The Company entered into this addendum to the agreement with Eco-Gen due to the credit risk that the Company perceived with relation to Eco-Gen’s clients, upon whose business Eco-Gen, and therefore the Company, are dependent. The Company records Eco-Gen revenue as earned, pursuant to the addendum to the Eco-Gen agreement.

To perform our obligations under the Eco-Gen agreement, the Company will engage contract manufacturers and other independent contractors to perform the services and charge the cost of goods and services through to Eco-Gen with a 15% margin. As the services will be outsourced by the Company using third parties, including (but not limited to) intellectual property legal counsel to register trademarks and patents, engineering and manufacturing firms to design and produce the Company’s products, and marketing and advertising firms, the Company plans to manufacture and source products under the Eco-Gen agreement with limited personnel resources.
 
Eco-Gen is a technology development and intellectual property holding company with no full-time employees. Eco-Gen’s management does not possess the time or resources to enter into the outsourcing agreements necessary to commercialize the company’s technology on their own, and as such, we understand that our services answer a specific need for Eco-Gen. With no full-time employees, Eco-Gen outsources the majority of its service needs. Our business model and service strategy are intended to meet that need, for Eco-Gen and for all of our customers.
 
Eco-Gen Energy, Inc. is a private Nevada corporation formed on March 23, 2009. According to the unaudited financial statements provided by Eco-Gen Energy, Inc., as of the fiscal year-end at December 31, 2019 and as of November 21, 2020, Eco-Gen has total current assets of $269,778.44 and $272,297.26, respectively, and total cash on hand as of November 21, 2020 is $267,297.26, consisting primarily of funds held in savings and checking accounts. According to Eco-Gen Energy, Inc.’s unaudited financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, Eco-Gen had total net loss of ($247,486.74), with total income at $812,224.23, total cost of goods sold of $430,551.94, gross profit of $381,672.29, and total expenses of $675,188.38. For the 2020 fiscal year as of November 21, 2020, Eco-Gen has total income of $25,800.00 and total cost of goods sold of $5,000.00, for a gross profit of $20,800.00, and total expenses of $28,281.18, for an operating loss of ($7,481.18) as of November 21, 2020, according to the unaudited financial statements provided by Eco-Gen Energy, Inc.
 
With relation to Eco-Gen’s primary contracted technology, the JouleBox® Power Station, the agreement between the Company and Eco-Gen requires that Eco-Gen pay all Company services in advance and does not require the Company to extend credit to Eco-Gen. As our services for the production of the JouleBox® Power Station must be pre-paid by Eco-Gen, we anticipate that none of the proceeds of this Offering will be necessary to allow the Company to perform services related to contract manufacturing of the JouleBox® Power Station under the contract with Eco-Gen. We expect our work with Eco-Gen to be focused primarily on the JouleBox® Power Station over the next 12 months following the Offering. Eco-Gen has a ten-year operating history and approximately 200 shareholders.
 
Our business with and anticipated revenue from Eco-Gen is dependent upon our ability to perform under our agreement with Eco-Gen, and dependent on both the functionality of Eco-Gen’s JouleBox® Power Station technology and the ability of Eco-Gen’s customers to pay Eco-Gen. According to Eco-Gen, Eco-Gen’s primary clients and business are with purchasers who have contracted with Eco-Gen for delivery of Eco-Gen’s products, where the Company will provide for the manufacture of those products. As such, our business and anticipated revenue from our agreement with Eco-Gen is completely dependent upon Eco-Gen’s business and anticipated revenue from Eco-Gen’s customers. Primarily, according to Eco-Gen, Eco-Gen’s business is dependent upon two clients who have contracted for the purchase and delivery of Eco-Gen’s products: a for-profit municipal enterprise dedicated to regional economic development and wholly owned and funded by a municipality in Puerto Rico, and a green technology distributor located in California, with total assets of $4,396,456, including current assets (cash and inventory) of $2,851,710, and year-to-date net revenues of $1,368,707, as of December 31, 2020. For specific risks related to our business with Eco-Gen, see the risk factor on page 17 titled “We face risks associated with our business with Eco-Gen Energy, Inc. that could harm our financial condition and results of operations.”
 
In relation to our agreement with Eco-Gen, Eco-Gen represents to us that Eco-Gen has received two purchase commitments from the above-mentioned customers related to the JouleBox® Power Station, for $13,749,875 from the Puerto Rican regional development enterprise, and $6,050,000 from the California green technology distributor, representing total current JouleBox® Power Station purchase commitments of $19,799,875. The purchase order in the amount of $13,749,875 was made on November 2, 2020, is for a 2 megawatt generator, and calls for a 50% down payment with the purchase order, and the balance due upon delivery of the 2 megawatt JouleBox® Power Station, with funds held in escrow by a California lawyer acting as escrow agent. The purchase commitment in the amount of $6,050,000 is in the form of a joint venture agreement, dated July 23, 2020, between Eco-Gen and the California green technology distributor, where that distributor will pay for the purchase of the joint venture’s JouleBox® Power Station as its consideration for the joint venture.
 
Under our agreement with Eco-Gen, these JouleBox® Power Station purchases will initiate our corresponding provision of services to Eco-Gen under our Master Outsourcing Contract Manufacturing Agreement with Eco-Gen, as we bear responsibility to cause those products to be manufactured for delivery to Eco-Gen’s customers. In the third quarter of 2020, Eco-Gen paid the Company $100,000 in cash for services towards fulfillment of these orders, which are service fees considered earned and non-refundable under the Eco-Gen agreement. As of the date of this 10k report, all services paid for by Eco-Gen have been performed pursuant to the relevant purchase orders. However, since the first phase of the contract is not complete, the Company has chosen to take conservative position of recording the deposit received as deferred revenue.

Power BoosterTM Licensing Agreement
 
On June 16, 2020, the Company signed a Master Exclusive Licensing, Marketing, Distribution and Sales Agreement with the Bellagio IP Trust for the Power Booster™ technology, giving the Company the exclusive right to market Power Booster™ products. The Power Booster™ technology utilizes proprietary technologies incorporating electrical magnetism and high-speed switching technology to boost energy output from residential and commercial power systems. The Power Booster™ is based on advanced electronics that allow an electrical system within a home or business to be supplied with 880 watts of electricity and output useful electrical power of 2,200 watts while increasing the Power Factor (PF) and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). 
 
The Company licensed the Power Booster™ technology based on the Company’s belief that the technology has the potential to achieve high-value commercial success. Based on tests performed by the Company and the patent holder, the Power Booster™ technology can achieve up to a 60% saving in energy consumption, depending on multiple factors, including intended usage, quality of existing power source and overall system configuration, over standard generator technology. Actual energy savings will vary depending on overall application and other factors. The Company plans to engage third parties to market products using the Power Booster™ technology in the United States.
 
The core technology behind the Power Booster™ system is based on an innovative use of high-speed switching that is not currently available the U.S. generator market.  The system allows for energy creation in direct proportion to the induction of the magnetic field implemented into the system, thus creating useful electric energy from the magnetic field.  The Company plans to administer the marketing of the Power Booster™ system via multiple sales channels, including solar power electrical manufacturers, solar power systems integrators and installers, new homebuilders, and power system distribution companies. Additionally, the increased PF and THD mean that in some installations, when the device is properly installed and configured, the user will need less electricity.
 
The Exclusive Global Licensing Agreement with the Bellagio IP Trust (“Bellagio”)(the “Bellagio Agreement”) grants rights to the Company to market the Power Booster™ and other products developed by Bellagio. In exchange for the agreement, the Company has issued Bellagio a restricted stock grant of twenty-five million (25,000,000) restricted common shares in the Company and will pay to Bellagio a royalty of 11% of the net manufacturing price of all Power Booster™ products sold. With the Bellagio Agreement put into place, the Company is in the initial stages of marketing and distributing the Power Booster™ system and has thus far generated no revenue from the product. Since the signing date of the Exclusive Global Licensing Agreement with Bellagio, the impacts of Covid-19 on the 2020 business climate has impeded significant progress by the Company on this initiative. Due to international travel restrictions since March of 2020, the "Development and Manufacturing Agreement" mentioned in the agreement has not been executed yet, and the Company cannot be sure if or when, under the current global climate, that manufacturing agreement will be signed. Additionally, bringing the Power Booster™ technology to market will require significant financial inputs on the Company’s part over the next 12 months.
 MagnoSpringTM Licensing Agreement
 On October 26, 2020, the Company signed an Exclusive License Agreement with Fortin & Associates LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Fortin”), giving the Company the exclusive worldwide right to make, use, sell, lease, import, export, or otherwise dispose of products utilizing Fortin’s magnetic spring mechanical motor technology, including the right to have products using the energy efficient technology made by third party manufacturers. The MagnoSpringTM technology comprises a mechanical motor that produces the rotation of its shaft using a system of magnets and springs. Pursuant to the MagnoSpringTM technology licensing agreement with Fortin, after the completion of an operable prototype that provides proof of concept for the technology, Fortin shall, at the Company’s expense, procure patents for the MagnoSpringTM technology. Under the agreement, the Company is responsible for all costs for preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of patents for the MagnoSpringTM technology, and shall have final authority over all decisions concerning filing prosecution of patent applications and patents, including the selection of patent attorneys.
 As compensation to Fortin for entering into the Exclusive License Agreement for the MagnoSpringTM technology with the Company, we agreed to pay Fortin (or its principals) a restricted stock grant of 6,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock subject to a vesting schedule to be determined in the relevant stock grant agreement. Additionally, the Company will pay a royalty of 10% of the net cost of goods for products using the MagnoSpringTM technology that are manufactured and sold. The MagnoSpringTM technology licensing agreement is a continuing worldwide licensing agreement that according to its terms shall remain in effect during the complete lifetime of all patents for the MagnoSpringTM technology.
