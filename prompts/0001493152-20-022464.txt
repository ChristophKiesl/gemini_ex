ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
General Information about Our Company
 
Life Clips, Inc. (“Life Clips”, “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company”) was incorporated in Wyoming on March 20, 2013 as Blue Sky Media Corporation and its principal business was developing, financing, producing and distributing motion pictures and related entertainment products. Following the Company’s October 2, 2015 acquisition of Klear Kapture, Inc. (“Klear Kapture”), the Company continued Klear Kapture’s business of developing a body camera and an auditable software solution suitable for use by law enforcement. The Company changed its name to Life Clips, Inc. on November 3, 2015 in order to better reflect its business operations at the time.
Recent Developments
 
On July 11, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of all of the outstanding equity securities of Batterfly Energy Ltd. (“Batterfly”), an Israel-based corporation that develops and distributes a single-use, cordless battery under the brand name Mobeego for use with cellular phones and other mobile devices. Batterfly is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Acquisition was completed pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 10, 2016 (the “Purchase Agreement”), among the Company, Batterfly and all of the shareholders of Batterfly, as amended.
 
Following the acquisition of Batterfly, we began to focus on developing three synergistic businesses:
 

● | Expanding the Mobeego line of mobile accessories. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Global Sourcing Services that includes product design, factory identification, negotiations, compliance qualification, and end-to-end logistics management to source products anywhere in the world. 
● | Sales and marketing services that provide an efficient path for companies to launch and market product into multi-channel retail and capture the maximum return on investment. 

 
The Company is currently pursuing alternative business opportunities. There has been limited activity due to a delay in securing funding. The Company is working to re-energize the business within the next 12 months.
 
Products
 
Our core product is Mobeego batteries.
 
Batteries
 
Mobeego consists of a one-time use, non-rechargeable, battery and a special, reusable phone adapter (plug), which is a small device that includes the charging control circuity as well as a specific male connector that matches user device’s female connector. The Company is evaluating the resumption of selling Mobeego in two manners:

(1) | Sets including a specific adapter and one or two emergency batteries 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Refill Batteries 
(3) | 6 pack of Batteries 
(4) | set including an adapter and one emergency battery for Action cameras such as Life Clips’ action camera. 

The Battery (Energy Unit):
 
The Energy Unit consists of a custom designed plastic casing, shaped as a small can of energy drink, hosting a powerful lithium battery. The energy “can” has a rail used to connect it to the adapter through a rail connection. This unit is designed to be seen as the “energy drink for the mobile devices”. It is for a single use and is non-rechargeable.
Adapter
 
The adapter is a small plastic device that connects to the Battery through 2 connectors and to the mobile device through the specific connector on user’s cellphone, which could be Lightning or Deck for iPhones, micro-USB for Android devices, Blackberries and others. The adapter features an On/Off switch and a LED to indicate when it’s charging. Within the adapter, there is a smart, electronic charging circuit on a circuit board.

Sales
 
We are evaluating a sales distribution model and the viability of sales of our products through retailers directly and through distributors. We are evaluating relationships with retailers and distributors, and our partners’ sales forces to map out a sales strategy for our products and a way to work with them to merchandise our products in a compelling manner in-store, as well as assessing a viable way to provide consumers with informative and convenient ecommerce experiences at retail partner websites.
 
Direct sales
 
In addition to the evaluation of our international sales model, we are evaluating the feasibility of selling directly to large and small retailers in the United States, directly to some retail outlets. Elements of the plans we are evaluating include:
 

● | Independent specialty retailers. Potential use of a network of location-based independent manufacturer representatives to sell our products to independent specialty retailers focused on action sports markets. Our representatives would provide highly personalized service to these retailers, including assisting with product mix planning, channel marketing and in-store merchandising, taking orders and providing clinics to educate retail sales personnel about Mobeego products. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Big box retailers. Potential sales to large retailers with a national presence, including Amazon.com, Inc., Best Buy, Target Corporation and Wal-Mart, Inc. 
● | Mid-market retailers. Potential sales to retailers with a large regional or national presence, often focused on specific verticals such as consumer electronics, sporting goods, military, hunting and fishing and motor sports, which we refer to as our “mid-market” channel. 
● | Ecommerce channel. Sales of our Mobeego products directly to consumers around the world through an online store. We will evaluate ways to drive consumers to our website through online and offline advertising, as well as marketing promotions carried out at tradeshows and sponsored events. 

 
Competition, competitive position in the industry and methods of competition
 
The battery industry is highly competitive. The Company faces intense competition from very large, international corporations, as well as from local and national companies. In addition, the Company faces competition from well-known companies that have large market share.
 
The intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase and no assurance can be provided that the Company can sustain its market position or expand its business.
 
Many of the Company’s current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and name recognition, which the Company does not have.
 
The global sourcing industry is highly competitive. We face competition from very large international competitors. The competition in the future is going to increase.
 
Status of any publicly announced new product or service
 
None.

Any encroachment upon the Company’s proprietary information, including the unauthorized use of its brand name, the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated either by our Company or against our Company for infringement upon proprietary information or improper use of a trademark, may affect our ability to create brand name recognition, cause customer confusion and/or have a detrimental effect on its business due to the cost of defending any potential litigation related to infringement. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. or International Patent and Trademark Offices may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and/or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could seriously harm our business operations and/or results of operations.
