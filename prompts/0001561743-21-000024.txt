 ITEM 1.    BUSINESS. 
Overview 
We are a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative biologics focused on saving and improving the lives of pets. Our mission is to bring to pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that our human family members enjoy. Our core strategy is to identify targets that have already demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans and to develop therapeutics based on these validated targets for dogs and cats. We believe that this approach will lead to shorter development times and higher approval rates than pursuing new, non-validated targets. Our current portfolio includes over 20 product candidates in development, predominantly biologics. We also have state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing capabilities and a broad intellectual property portfolio.
Our first product, Mirataz® (mirtazapine transdermal ointment) was approved in May 2018 and became commercially available to veterinarians in the United States in July 2018. In November 2019, our second product, Zimeta™ (dipyrone injection) for the control of fever in horses was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and became commercially available in December 2019. In addition, we have a portfolio of other product candidates, predominantly biologics, in various stages of development.
On March 16, 2020, we announced we will further prioritize biologics programs for dogs and cats and rely primarily on a partnership-focused commercialization model, which is expected to significantly reduce the amount of additional dilutive capital the company will require. We believe monoclonal antibodies are the future of veterinary medicine, and represent the greatest opportunity for value creation, given large potential markets for our programs and our competitive advantage in biologics. As part of the strategic realignment, we substantially reduced our commercial footprint and discontinued development of most canine and feline small molecule programs. This business model is expected to achieve a better return for our stockholders. 
We were incorporated in Delaware in September 2012. The address of our principal executive offices is 1555 Bayshore Highway, Suite 200, Burlingame, CA 94010. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “KindredBio,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 (the “2020 Annual Report”) refer to Kindred Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
Recent Milestones
Product Highlights



On March 16, 2020, we signed an agreement to sell Mirataz® (mirtazapine transdermal ointment), our transdermal drug for the management of weight loss in cats, to Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC ("Dechra") for a cash purchase price of $43 million, of which $38.7 million was paid on the closing date and $4.3 million will be paid out of escrow beginning in 12 months assuming no escrow claims, alongside an ongoing royalty on global net sales. The acquisition comprises worldwide marketing rights, intellectual property rights, marketing authorizations and associated regulatory documentation, third party supply contracts related to raw material and manufacture of the finished product, and certain product inventory. With commercial sales and marketing teams in 25 countries, and distributor relationships in an additional 72 countries, Dechra is strongly positioned to market Mirataz in the United States, Europe, and globally. Their focus on the sale of technical and value-added specialty pharmaceuticals has led to the development of market-leading brands in the specialty veterinarian sector, particularly within the field of chronic disease management. With a complementary feline product portfolio targeting diseases linked to feline weight loss, Mirataz will represent an important cross-promotional product for Dechra worldwide.
Mirataz is the first and only FDA approved transdermal medication specifically developed for the management of weight loss in cats. Unintended weight loss is a serious unmet medical need in cats, and may be caused by multiple factors, including chronic illness, like chronic kidney disease, or behavioral issues, such as stress. If untreated, it may lead to hepatic lipidosis, which can be a life-threatening condition.
On December 12, 2019, KindredBio announced that the European Commission granted marketing authorization of Mirataz for bodyweight gain in cats experiencing poor appetite and weight loss resulting from chronic medical conditions. Mirataz is the first and only medication approved in the EU to induce bodyweight gain in cats experiencing poor appetite and weight loss resulting from chronic medical conditions. Europe represents the second largest market for veterinary therapeutics internationally. The authorization is valid in all 28-member states of the European Union, together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway, and including the UK. Dechra, which is based in the United Kingdom, plans to launch Mirataz in the UK and the European Union, and intends to conduct the necessary regulatory activities to achieve approvals in other key international markets.
 We recorded $822,000 in Mirataz net product revenues in 2020, which reflects our product sales up through the date of the sale of Mirataz to Dechra on March 16, 2020. This compares with net product revenues of $4.1 million in 2019 and $2.0 million in 2018, when the product was launched in July of that year. Mirataz royalty revenue for the year ended 2020 was $535,000.
 
ZimetaTM (dipyrone injection) (Zimeta IV) 

On November 25, 2019 KindredBio announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Zimeta™ (dipyrone injection) for the control of pyrexia in horses. Pyrexia, or fever, is associated with a number of underlying diseases and can result in significant negative outcomes, including dehydration, laminitis, muscle wasting, weight loss, and in some cases death. Zimeta is the first injectable dipyrone product to receive FDA approval for use in horses. Dipyrone, the active ingredient in Zimeta, is a member of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) class and has a centrally acting mechanism of action on the hypothalamus where fever originates and is regulated. 
As part of the strategic restructuring announcement on March 16, 2020 and our further prioritization on biologics programs for dogs and cats, we evaluated the potential spin-out or divestiture of our equine assets. In December 2020, we entered into a Distribution and Licensing Agreement granting Dechra Veterinary Products LLC (Dechra), a corporation registered in Delaware, an exclusive license under our Patents and Marketing Authorizations to promote, market, sell and distribute Zimeta in the territory (US and Canada). We are responsible for the performance of our third party manufacturer for Zimeta, including the performance of all duties and including but not limited to, timely delivery of product meeting the applicable specifications. In consideration for the exclusive license and manufacturing services to be performed by us, Dechra will pay KindredBio a milestone payment upon achievement of a certain sales milestone, a royalty fee and a price per unit of Zimeta.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $27,000 in Zimeta net product revenues compared to $127,000 in 2019, when the product was launched in December of that year. 
Biologic Product Candidates
On March 16, 2020, we announced we will further prioritize our biologics programs for dogs and cats, which we view as our highest potential assets. 
KIND-016, Tirnovetmab (Interleukin-31)
In October 2018, we announced positive topline results from our pilot laboratory effectiveness study of tirnovetmab, KIND-016, a fully caninized, high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-31 (IL-31), for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. In addition, we announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued a patent (Patent No. 10,093,731) for KindredBio's anti-IL31 antibody.
In July 2019, we reported positive topline results from a pilot field effectiveness study for our IL-31 antibody that confirmed the results from our pilot laboratory study. The manufacturing scale up process proceeded and the pivotal efficacy study of KIND-016 was initiated in December 2020. 
Canine atopic dermatitis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin condition in dogs and is the leading reason owners take their dog to the veterinarian. Atopic dermatitis is a large market, with the leading two products on the market selling over $900 million per year. We are pursuing a multi-pronged approach toward atopic dermatitis, with a portfolio of promising biologics. Our market research tells us there is strong demand for new biological treatments for pruritic dogs, with 70% of veterinarians, and a higher percentage of dermatologists, expressing a need for alternatives to current therapies.
KIND-032 
In December 2019, we announced the outcome of a positive pilot laboratory study of KIND-032, a fully caninized monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. In the study, 14 laboratory dogs with clinical signs consistent with atopic dermatitis were dosed with placebo or with KIND-032 at two different doses. The Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI) scores were assessed by board-certified veterinary dermatologists who were blinded to treatment assignments. The study demonstrated that KindredBio's antibody was well-tolerated. Although the 

study was a single-dose study designed primarily to assess safety and pharmacokinetics, evidence of positive efficacy and dose response was observed at Week 1, as measured by CADESI-04. A second pilot study to further assess dosing commenced in the third quarter of 2020. 
The IL-4 pathway is a key driver of the inflammation that underlies atopic dermatitis and several other allergic diseases. Unlike KIND-025, which binds to IL-4 and IL-13 circulating in blood, KIND-032 binds to the IL-4 receptor on the surface of immune cells. 
KIND-025
On March 24, 2020, we announced positive results from our pilot field efficacy study of KIND-025, a canine fusion protein targeting IL-4 and IL-13, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. A higher treatment success rate was observed in the KIND-025 group over the placebo group from week 1 through week 4. Positive efficacy signals were also detected with other endpoints including 20mm or higher reduction from baseline in PVAS score. Cell line development is being continued as we further evaluate this program. The IL-4 and IL-13 pathways are key drivers of the inflammation that underlies atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases. The IL-4/13 SINK molecule binds to both IL-4 and IL-13 circulating in the blood and inhibits their interactions with their respective receptors, thereby modifying the clinical signs associated with atopic dermatitis. We currently do not have plans to prioritize KIND-025 ahead of our other programs.
KIND-030
In August 2019, we announced positive results from our pilot efficacy study of KIND-030, a chimeric, high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting canine parvovirus (CPV). This was a 12-dog study, of which 4 dogs were treated prophylactically and 2 dogs were treated after establishment of the infection. All treated dogs survived, compared to none in the applicable placebo group. The effect was seen in both prophylaxis setting, as well as in a treatment setting after establishment of infection. On September 16, 2020, we reported positive results from our pivotal efficacy study of KIND-030 in prevention of parvovirus infection in prophylactic treatment. In the randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study, KIND-030 was administered to dogs as prophylactic therapy to prevent clinical signs of CPV infection. The primary objectives of the study were met. All of the placebo-control dogs developed parvovirus infection as predefined in the study protocol, while none of the KIND-030 treated dogs developed the disease. Furthermore, the parvovirus challenge resulted in 60% mortality rate in the control dogs compared to 0% mortality rate in the KIND-030 treated dogs.
KIND-030 is being pursued for two indications in dogs: prophylactic therapy to prevent clinical signs of canine parvovirus infection and treatment of established parvovirus infection. The pivotal efficacy study for the treatment indication is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021. There is no set review timeline at the United States Department of Agriculture Center for Veterinary Biologics. Regulatory approval and review timeline are subject to the typical risks inherent in such a process.
CPV is the most significant cause of viral enteritis in dogs, especially puppies, with a mortality rate reportedly as high as 91% if untreated. A 2014 Banfield State of Pet Health report noted at least 250,000 dogs are infected with parvoviruses each year, excluding emergency hospitals, shelters, specialty hospitals or undiagnosed cases. While there are vaccines available for CPV, they have to be administered multiple times and many puppies do not receive the vaccine at all, or do not receive the complete series. This will not replace the need for vaccination; it may just change the timing of the vaccination post administration. There are currently no approved or unapproved treatments for CPV. Currently, owners spend up to thousands of dollars for supportive care for dogs infected with CPV.
In December 2020, we announced an agreement granting Elanco Animal Health, Inc. ("Elanco") exclusive global rights to KIND-030. Under the terms of the agreement, KindredBio will receive an upfront payment of $500,000, development milestone payments of up to $16 million upon achievement of certain development, regulatory and manufacturing targets, and sales milestones in an aggregate amount of up to $94 

million payable throughout the term of the agreement. Furthermore, royalty payments are to range from the low to high teens. The agreement specifies that KindredBio will supply the licensed product to Elanco, and that Elanco will conduct the necessary regulatory activities to achieve approvals in Europe and other key international markets.
KIND-509
On December 21, 2020, we announced positive results from the pilot field efficacy study of our monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF antibody) for canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The study was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled pilot effectiveness study that enrolled 10 dogs diagnosed with IBD to assess the efficacy and safety of KindredBio's anti-TNFα antibody over a 4-week treatment period. The primary effectiveness variable for this exploratory study was reduction in Canine Inflammatory Bowel Disease Activity Index (CIBDAI) score, which was assessed at Screening and Days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Complete remission, defined as ≥ 75% reduction in average post-dose CIBDAI score from baseline, was achieved in 75% of the anti-TNFα group compared to 17% in the placebo group. The treatment effect was early-onset and durable. At Day 7, the first post-dose visit, 75% of the anti-TNFα treated dogs showed ≥ 75% reduction of CIBDAI score from baseline, compared to 17% in the placebo group. Furthermore, 50% of the anti-TNFα treated dogs achieved and maintained 100% reduction of CIBDAI score from baseline throughout all post-dose visits, whereas none in the placebo group achieved the same result.
IBD is a chronic disease of the gastrointestinal tract and can affect dogs at any age, but is more common in middle-aged and older dogs. The majority of canine IBD cases involve chronic states of diarrhea, vomiting, gastroenteritis, inappetence, and other symptoms, certain of which are cited as among the most frequent disorders impacting dogs. For certain dog breeds, the prevalence of diarrhea exceeds 5%. Existing treatments can have significant drawbacks, including limited diets and excessive antibiotic use, which can lead to owner frustration, lapses in treatment adherence, or poor quality of life for the affected animal.
KIND-510a
In January 2019, we announced positive topline results from our pilot field effectiveness study of KIND-510a, a long-acting feline recombinant erythropoietin being developed for the management of non-regenerative anemia in cats. It has been engineered by KindredBio to have a prolonged half-life compared to endogenous erythropoietin, a protein that regulates and stimulates production of red blood cells. The pivotal efficacy study for KIND-510a was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2019.
On November 25, 2020, KindredBio made the decision to suspend the feline recombinant erythropoietin program following an adverse event. Patient safety is paramount to KindredBio. Given the impact of safety profile on the program's commercial value, and amid the continued rapid growth of the canine dermatitis market, the decision was made to redirect resources toward accelerating KindredBio's programs for canine atopic dermatitis. KindredBio maintains backup programs for its feline recombinant erythropoietin and may seek to develop these at a later date.
Anemia is a common condition that is estimated to affect millions of older cats. It is often associated with chronic kidney disease, because kidneys produce erythropoietin and chronic kidney disease leads to decreased levels of endogenous erythropoietin. Chronic kidney disease affects approximately half of older cats, making it a leading cause of feline mortality. Human erythropoietins, which are multi-billion-dollar products in the human market, are immunogenic in cats.
KIND-511
KIND-511 is an anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (“anti-TNF”) treatment for newborn foals. Sick newborn foals, defined as sepsis score ≥ 11 or positive blood culture, are challenging, and difficult to treat and result in approximately 50% mortality. We have completed a pilot field study in sick or septic foals to assess safety and 

efficacy of anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, with positive results. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the difference in survival between the control and placebo groups was statistically significant (p=0.0293). There is currently no FDA-approved therapy. We have placed this program on indefinite hold to focus on accelerating our late-stage biologic candidates in the canine and feline markets.
We also have promising new antibody candidates under development, which will be disclosed at a later stage of development and as lead programs further advance. 
Small Molecule Product Candidates
On March 16, 2020, KindredBio announced the discontinuation of the development of canine and feline small molecule candidates as we prioritize our pipeline of innovative biologic candidates. 
We completed a strategic review of our equine candidates. In December 2020, we entered into a Distribution and Licensing Agreement granting Dechra an exclusive license under our Patents and Marketing Authorizations to promote, market, sell and distribute Zimeta in the US and Canadian territories in return for a royalty on sales and milestone payment upon achievement of a certain sales milestone. We made the decision to discontinue the development of KIND-012 (dipyrone oral gel) and pause the development of KIND-014 to focus on accelerating our late-stage biologic candidates.
Market Overview
We believe there are significant unmet medical needs for pets, and that the pet therapeutics segment of the animal health industry is likely to grow substantially as new therapeutics are identified, developed and marketed specifically for pets. We plan to commercialize our feline and canine biologics in the United States through commercial partnerships, and in the European Union (the “EU”) primarily through commercial partnerships, distributors and other third parties.
Relative to human drug development, the development of pet therapeutics is generally faster and less expensive, since it requires fewer clinical studies involving fewer subjects and can be conducted directly in the target species. For example, studies that are typically required for approval of human drugs such as QTC studies, which detect cardiac irregularities, elderly patient studies, renal impairment studies, hepatic impairment studies or costly, long-term genotoxicity studies are not required for pet therapeutics. Based on our progress since inception in September 2012, we believe we can develop biologics in around six years at an average cost of approximately $8 million. The lower cost associated with the development of pet therapeutics permits us to pursue multiple product candidates simultaneously and avoid the binary outcome associated with the development of a single lead therapy by some human biotechnology companies. Because our strategy is to identify targets that have already demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans and to develop therapeutics based on these validated targets, we can often advance our programs more rapidly than if we were pursuing unvalidated targets. Biologics could be submitted under USDA, FDA or EMA regulatory authorities for approval. 
We estimate that the total U.S. market for veterinary care was approximately $99.0 billion in 2020, of which veterinary care and product sales comprised $30.2 billion. According to the 2019-2020 American Pet Products Association (APPA) National Pet Owners Survey, 67% of households owned a pet, which equates to 84.9 million homes. It is estimated that there are 97.0 million dogs and 76.0 million cats currently living in the United States. We believe there are many unmet or underserved medical needs and that the pet therapeutics portion of the market can grow significantly as new, safe and effective therapeutics are identified, developed and marketed. We expect continued market growth as new pet therapeutics are developed and owners grow more familiar with the treatment of pets with such therapeutics.
The equine sector shares many similarities with the orphan human market. There are fewer horses than dogs or cats, but the willingness to pay is substantially higher. 
Management Team
Our small molecule approvals at both the FDA and EMA jurisdiction and the progress of the biologicals portfolio are testament to the management team’s extensive experience in both human and animal drug development. 
Richard Chin, M.D., our Chief Executive Officer, was previously Head of Clinical Research for the Biotherapeutics Unit at Genentech, Inc., where he oversaw Phase I through Phase IV clinical programs for all products except oncology. Wendy Wee, our Chief Financial Officer, has over 30 years of experience and most recently was Vice President of Finance and Principal Accounting Officer at Telik, Inc. Hangjun Zhan, Ph.D., our Chief Scientific Officer, is a well-established protein biochemist and biophysicist with over 20 years of drug discovery experience in the biotechnology industry. Ms. Wee recently announced her intention to retire as our Chief Financial Officer on August 31, 2021, and we are in the process of identifying a new Chief Financial Officer.
Product Pipeline 
As of March 16, 2021, our product pipeline is focused on innovative biologics for dogs and cats.
The US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Center for Veterinary Biologics and the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine have a memorandum of understanding under which animal products are to be regulated by the USDA as biologics, if they are intended for use to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease in animals and they work primarily through an immune process, or by the FDA as drugs, if they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of animal disease if the primary mechanism of action is not immunological or is undefined. Although we believe that most of our current animal biologics will be regulated by the USDA based on their mechanisms of action, certain of our animal biologics will be regulated by the FDA instead of the USDA.
We are currently pursuing over 20 indications with a focus on biologics product candidates. The following table illustrates some of the product candidates that we are developing.
Product Selection and Development 
We utilize a rigorous screening and review process to identify targets that have demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans and address unmet medical needs in veterinary medicine. In some cases, we identify a chemical or functional equivalent of a validated human drug that addresses the same biological target or pathway. We review these targets with a view to differentiating them from existing treatments, including human products used extra-label in animals, based on ease of administration, method of delivery, dosing regimen, and other similar factors. 

Biologic therapies are typically derived from living organisms. A biologic can be defined as a large complex molecule (nucleic acid and protein platforms) produced from or extracted from a biological or living system. They are made by genetically engineering living cells, and a high level of precision is required in the manufacturing process to produce a consistent biologic product each time. A biologic product can be a monoclonal antibody, a vaccine, a tissue, or various proteins such as cytokines, enzymes, fusion proteins, whole cells, and viral and non-viral gene therapies. Our biologic product candidates are usually based on therapies and targets for which products have been successfully commercialized for humans. Human antibody therapies are expensive and are often ineffective in other species since they are usually immunogenic or recognized as foreign bodies and rejected by the immune systems of dogs, cats, horses, and other animals. We identify or create biologics, including antibodies, that are fully or mostly canine or feline. We generally intend to seek composition-of-matter and other patents for these new biologics.
In January 2020, we announced that we developed a technology to extend canine antibody half-life by up to three-fold. A patent application for this technology has been filed. 
The study comprised 12 dogs, including four groups with various modifications incorporating KindredBio technology and one wild type canine antibody as control. Half-life extension was observed in all dogs across all groups other than the wild type, with the magnitude of extension over native antibody ranging from two to three-fold. 
Half-life extension technologies have the potential to improve therapeutic performance in numerous ways. Reduced dosing frequency and/or amount of dosing can lead to improved pet owner convenience and compliance. It can also substantially lower the cost of goods and enhance profitability and market positioning. In addition, higher drug concentration using the same dose and dosing interval as the parent antibody can result in extended drug exposure and potentially improved efficacy.
In addition, KIND-Bodies, a unique biologics scaffold with certain advantages over traditional monoclonal antibodies, including bi-specific binding, is under development. We have also developed Fc engineering technologies that can improve affinity of canine antibodies to protein A, which is important for manufacturing of antibodies, and other technologies to modify the immune function of antibodies, and we have filed for IP on those technologies.
We have an in-house laboratory capable of protein engineering, cell line development, analytics, and other activities necessary for advancing a world-class biologics pipeline. We believe that we have one of the best biologics teams in the pharmaceutical industry, drawn from some of the top biotechnology companies.
Our biologic product candidates are not expected to face generic competition in the United States as there is no pathway for approval of a generic veterinary biologic regulated by the USDA.
Contract Manufacturing
In May 2020, we entered into an agreement with Vaxart, Inc. for the manufacture of Vaxart's oral vaccine candidate for COVID-19. We recorded contract manufacturing revenue based on the percentage completion of specific milestones for the year ended December 31, 2020. In October 2020, we announced the expansion of our manufacturing agreement with Vaxart for COVID-19 and other vaccine candidates. In addition, we will begin manufacturing, formulation and analytical services for the National Cancer Institute's PREVENT Cancer Preclinical Drug Development Program in 2021. KindredBio was selected as one of the three companies that were awarded the NCI cGMP manufacturing pool contract in 2019.
We have constructed a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in Burlingame, California for our initial biologic product candidates, which we believe is one of the first GMP biologics plants for veterinary products. We started GMP manufacturing in January 2018 and believe that the plant will position us as a leader in the veterinary biologics field, and potentially afford us an advantage in cost of goods for our products. We 

acquired a second manufacturing plant in August 2017 in Elwood, Kansas and construction to support initial production lines on our biologics manufacturing was completed in 2019. The bioreactors and fill & finish equipment are fully commissioned. The Elwood facility includes approximately 180,000 square feet with clean rooms, utility, equipment, and related quality documentation suitable for small molecule and biologics manufacturing.
Business Strategy 
Key elements of our business strategy are as follows: 
Continue to focus on the development of our pipeline
In addition to our focus on patient enrollment for our pivotal field study of KIND-016 and completing our pivotal treatment efficacy study of KIND-030, we expect to initiate a field pilot studies for KIND-032 and KIND-509 in 2021. Additionally, we are also developing multiple other products. In all, we have over 20 programs for various indications.
Continue to focus on cost-effective research and development execution
In order to execute our studies rapidly and efficiently, we have built an experienced team drawn from both the veterinary and human pharmaceutical industries. We rely primarily on our own personnel or independent contractors, rather than on contract research organizations (“CROs”), for many business-critical tasks, including protocol designs, regulatory interactions, statistics, data management and clinical operations. By doing so, we believe we can maintain higher quality, achieve lower costs and seek regulatory approval more quickly. 
Leverage our antibody and biologics experience
Members of our team have extensive experience developing biologics such as antibodies. We are leveraging their expertise to identify and develop antibody-based therapies for pets based on approved human therapies, and to identify appropriate manufacturing technologies for these product candidates.
Leverage our current product pipeline in additional animal species
We intend to develop our product candidates primarily for approval in one or more indications in predominantly dogs and cats. We may consider the development of our current or future product candidates for additional species in the future.
Expand our pipeline with additional product candidates
We identify biologic therapeutics, including therapeutic targets, that have demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans. We discover the biologics that are specific to canines or felines. We have already identified a number of additional product candidates in the pre-INAD stage that we may potentially pursue. We continuously seek to protect our product candidates through a combination of patents, know-how and other customary means. It is worth noting that there is no biosimilar pathway for veterinary medicine currently.
Commercialize our canine and feline products through commercial partners in the United States and other regions
As disclosed in our March 16, 2020 press release, KindredBio is transitioning to a partnership-focused commercialization model whereby pipeline assets are out-licensed to larger commercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payments, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales. Accordingly, our companion animal commercial infrastructure was dismantled in mid-2020.

Commercialize our equine products through distribution and licensing agreements with partners 
We executed a distribution and licensing agreement with Dechra to commercialize Zimeta. While KindredBio's current development activities are predominantly focused on biologics for dogs and cats, select distributor relationships may be used to market other equine products directly to veterinarians in the United States. We also intend to establish collaborations with distributors or licensing partners to commercialize any products that may be approved by the EMA. 
Fund development of our pipeline through contract manufacturing agreements 
We have set up a full-service contract development and manufacturing organization, Centaur Biopharmaceutical Services, Inc., proceeds of which are used to fund development of our companion animal product pipeline. Centaur's capabilities span production and process development, analytical development and process characterization, and leverage our manufacturing facilities in California and Kansas. 
Pet Therapeutics Market
Overview 
U.S. consumers spent an estimated $99.0 billion on their pets in 2020, according to the APPA. The veterinary care segment has been among the fastest growing segments of the overall U.S. pet market. This segment accounted for an estimated $30.2 billion spent on veterinary care in 2020. 
Researchers who specialize in studying the pet industry have noted its constant rise and recession-proof nature. Specifically, American pet spending has continued to rise each year since 1994 – even during the 2007-2009 recession – according to the APPA. In 2020, positive pet care trends during the pandemic based on increased adoptions and owners spending more time with their pets drove market growth.
We believe several factors will contribute to an increase in spending on pet therapeutics. Pets are generally living longer and as a result, are increasingly exhibiting many of the same diseases associated with aging in humans such as cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and diabetes. Among pet owners, there is growing familiarity in treating these pet diseases with medications. According to the APPA, in the U.S., approximately 63% of dog owners and 43% of cat owners treated their pets with medications in 2018. 
In addition, pet ownership numbers may increase as more people become aware of the myriad health benefits of pet ownership. According to the Human Animal Bond Research Institute, studies show that some of the benefits of having a dog include helping to lower blood pressure, decrease risk of heart disease, and preventing allergies in children.
Several studies have shown that pet owners are willing to make financial sacrifices for their pets. In a 2017 Harris Poll conducted for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountant, 76% of U.S. adults indicated they would make financial sacrifices for their pets to pay for an emergency expense such as medical care.
We expect pet owners to spend more on their pets' health and welfare as new therapeutics are developed specifically for pets. The trend of anthropomorphizing or humanizing pets continues as pet owners increasingly view pets as members of their family, or even as surrogate children. Numerous studies have shown pet owners celebrate pet birthdays, purchase Christmas gifts for their pets, and have embraced technology by purchasing electronic devices to monitor the location or health of their pets. 
Finally, the pet ownership levels and spending activity of millennials, which make up a quarter of the U.S. population, suggest these trends will continue into the future.
Pet Therapeutics Market Dynamics

The respective businesses of developing and commercializing therapeutics for pets and for humans share a number of characteristics, including the need to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for marketing, manufacture the therapeutics in facilities compliant with GMP requirements and market the therapeutics only for their intended indication based on claims permitted in the product label, and not for other uses, which is referred to as extra-label use.
Despite their similarities, there are a number of important differences between the pet therapeutics and human therapeutics businesses, including:
•    Faster, less expensive and more predictable development. The development of pet therapeutics requires fewer clinical studies in fewer subject animals than the development of human therapeutics and, unlike human therapeutics, is conducted directly in the target animals. We believe our strategy of selecting targets with demonstrated efficacy and safety in humans enhances the predictability of results and probability of success of our pivotal trials relative to targets that have not been previously validated. 
•    Role and incentives for veterinary practices. In the United States, veterinarians generally serve the dual role of doctor and pharmacist, and pet owners typically purchase medicines directly from their veterinarians. Therapeutics specifically developed for pets enable veterinarians to provide potentially superior treatment options, while also increasing revenue from the sale of these therapeutics. 
•    Primarily private-pay nature of veterinary market. Pet owners in the United States generally pay for pet therapeutics out-of-pocket, and approximately 14% of dogs and 7% of cats have health insurance. As a result, pet owners must make decisions primarily on their veterinarians’ advice regarding available treatment options, rather than on the treatment options’ eligibility for reimbursement by insurance companies or government payers. We believe this results in less pricing pressure than in human healthcare, although the limited adoption of insurance may also reduce pet owners’ ability to pay for therapeutics recommended by their veterinarians. 
•    Less generic competition and strong brand loyalty. There is less generic competition in the pet therapeutics industry than in the human healthcare industry. Approximately 14% of veterinary drugs face generic competition, and the percentage of generic prescriptions in the veterinary space is only 7% as compared to approximately 81% for human drugs. For example, Rimadyl, the leading U.S. pet NSAID, lost regulatory exclusivity in 2001, but its sales have grown since generic competition was introduced in 2005. We believe that stronger brand loyalty and lack of mandatory generic drug substitution, as in human pharmaceuticals, partially explains the low penetration of generics in veterinary medicine. 
Unmet Medical Needs in the Pet Therapeutics Market
Despite the growing market for pet therapeutics, there are relatively few treatment options approved for use in pets as compared to human therapeutic treatments. As a result, veterinarians often must resort to prescribing products approved for use in humans but not approved, formulated or even formally studied in pets. Veterinarians must then rely upon trial and error or untested rules of thumb to assess the proper dosage needed to be effective in the particular species without undue risk of side effects. The veterinarian must also find a way to administer the human product in animals and determine the appropriate dose to treat the disease in the species, which are important and potentially overlooked practical considerations in the treatment of pets.
Even in disease categories with approved pet therapeutics, significant unmet medical needs remain. For example, the NSAID class of products, commonly prescribed for pain, have potentially serious side effects in dogs that limit their long-term use and may require ongoing monitoring by veterinarians. The treatment of pain in cats is further complicated as a result of their differing biology, which makes NSAIDs toxic.

Animal health companies have been relatively slow to develop new therapeutics for pets and have tended to focus primarily on the larger market for the treatment of livestock and other farm animals. In 2020, human pharmaceutical companies received FDA/CDER approval for 141 original NDA and BLA drugs (non-generic), while animal health companies received only 16 FDA/CVM drug approvals. In the EU, the EMA recommended for authorization 97 new medicines (39 new active substances) for human use in 2020, compared only to 20 new medicines (10 new active substances) recommended for veterinary use. 
We believe that therapeutics specifically developed for pets can extend and improve pets’ quality of life, help veterinarians achieve improved medical outcomes and make the process of administering therapeutics to pets much more convenient. Advances in human medicines have created new therapeutics for managing chronic diseases associated with aging, such as osteoarthritis, cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Pets often suffer from the same disease as humans, including diabetes, arthritis, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease (canine cognitive dysfunction), lupus, Crohn’s disease, Lou Gehrig’s disease (degenerative myelopathy) and others. In most cases, the biologies of the diseases in pets are very similar to those in humans. Because of the similarity of the diseases, many human drugs, when formulated properly and administered in proper doses, are effective in pets. However, most human drugs are neither formulated nor approved for animals.
Commercialization
We have substantially reduced our companion animal commercial infrastructure and rely primarily on a partnership-focused commercialization model, whereby pipeline assets are out-licensed to larger commercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payments, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales. We believe this strategy will maximize the value of our pipeline, generate attractive commercial terms, and rely less on dilutive capital. 
According to industry sources, approximately one-third of pet veterinary practice revenue comes from prescription drug sales, vaccinations and non-prescription medicines. We believe veterinarians are self-motivated to prescribe innovative therapeutics that are safe, effective, and supported by reliable clinical data and regulatory approval in order to improve the health of pets, while also generating additional revenue.
Manufacturing
For biologics, we have established our own GMP manufacturing capabilities in Burlingame, California and proceeded to GMP manufacturing in January 2018. In August 2017, we acquired a manufacturing facility in Elwood, Kansas and completed construction and commissioning in 2019. The Elwood facility includes approximately 180,000 square feet with clean rooms, utility, equipment, and related quality documentation suitable for biologics and small molecule manufacturing. The USDA regulates the manufacture of pet biologics under standards that are less stringent than those for human biologics, which may reduce the cost of goods of our biologic product candidates relative to human biologics.
Competition
While there are fewer competitors in the pet therapeutics industry than in the human pharmaceutical industry, the development and commercialization of new animal health medicines is highly competitive, and we expect considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty animal health medicines companies.
Our potential competitors include large animal health companies, which currently derive the majority of their revenue from livestock medications. For example, in 2020 livestock accounted for 44%, and pets 55%, of sales for Zoetis, a large company focused on animal health. Within the pet therapeutics market, vaccines and parasiticides are currently the greatest sources of revenue.
Large animal health companies include Merck Animal Health, the animal health division of Merck & Co., Inc.; Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, the animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; 

Elanco Animal Health Incorporated; and Zoetis, Inc. We will also compete against several animal health companies, such as the Virbac Group, Ceva Animal Health and Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC. We are also aware of smaller companies that are developing products for use in the pet therapeutics market, including Zomedica, Scout Bio, and Anivive Lifesciences. 
At the product level, we will face competition for Zimeta from Flunixin and phenylbutazone, even though they are not approved for control of fever in horses. Mirataz, which was sold to Dechra in March 2020, will face competition from Elura. In addition, we may face competition from various products including additional products in development. Our products may also face competition from generic medicines and products approved for use in humans that are used extra-label for pets. Some of our other products also may face competition from their human generic equivalents in countries where such equivalents are available.
Many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially more financial, technical and human resources than we do. Many also have far more experience than we have in the development, manufacture, regulation and worldwide commercialization of animal health medicines, including pet therapeutics. In addition, these and other potential competing products may benefit from greater brand recognition and brand loyalty than any that our product candidates may achieve. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we and our products can compete effectively.
Intellectual Property
We intend to rely primarily upon a combination of regulatory exclusivity, patents, trade secret protection, proprietary know-how, license agreements, and confidentiality agreements to protect our product formulations, biologics, processes, therapeutic methods and other technologies, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. We currently have numerous provisional, nonprovisional, and international patent applications pending, and two U.S. issued patents, for our IL-31 antibody compositions-of-matter and corresponding methods of use. Because our approved product (Zimeta) and our other small molecule product candidates are based on generic human drugs, there is little, if any, composition-of-matter patent protection available for the API in such product candidates. We have filed patent applications on many of our biologic products. However, even intellectual property protection, if available to us, may not afford us with complete protection against competitors. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
We depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our management personnel, as well as that of our other employees, advisors, consultants and contractors, none of which are patentable. To help protect our know-how, and any inventions for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into customary confidentiality and inventions agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
Regulatory 
The development, approval and sale of animal health products are governed by the laws and regulations of each country in which we intend to sell our products. To comply with these regulatory requirements, we have established processes and resources to provide oversight of the development and launch of our products and their maintenance in the market. 
United States 
Three federal regulatory agencies regulate the health aspects of animal health products in the United States: the FDA; the USDA; and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). In addition, the Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) regulates animal therapeutics that are classified as controlled substances. 

The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (the “CVM”), regulates animal pharmaceuticals under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics (the “CVB”), regulates veterinary vaccines and certain biologics pursuant to the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act. The EPA Office of Pesticide Programs (the “OPP”) regulates veterinary pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. Many topical products used for treatment of flea and tick infestations are regulated by the EPA.
All of our current product candidates are animal pharmaceuticals or biologics regulated by the CVM or the CVB, respectively. Manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals and biologics, including us, must show their products to be safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture. We are also required to conduct post-approval monitoring of products and to submit reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results, and are subject to regulatory inspection from time to time. In addition, for our controlled substance product candidates, we are required to comply with the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”) and related state laws regarding manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, production and procurement quotas, recordkeeping, reporting, handling, shipment and disposal. 
Requirements for Approval of Veterinary Pharmaceuticals for Pets 
As a condition to regulatory approval for the sale of animal products, regulatory agencies worldwide generally require that a product to be used for pets be demonstrated to: 
•    be safe for the intended use in the intended species;
•    have substantial evidence of effectiveness for the intended use;
•    have a defined manufacturing process that ensures the product can be made with high quality consistency; and
•    be safe for humans handling the product and for the environment.
Safety. To determine that a new veterinary drug is safe for use, most regulatory authorities will require us to provide data from a safety study generated in laboratory cats and dogs tested at doses higher than the intended label dose, over a period of time determined by the intended length of dosing of the product. In the case of the FDA, the design and review of the safety study and the study protocol can be completed prior to initiation of the study to help assure that the data generated will meet FDA requirements. These studies are conducted under rigorous quality control, including GLP, to assure integrity of the data. They are designed to clearly define a safety margin, identify any potential safety concerns, and establish a safe dose for the product. In addition, safety data from pivotal field studies conducted under GCP standards are evaluated to assure that the product will be safe in the target population. Furthermore, because safety and effectiveness studies must conform to VICH guidelines, which are established under an international program aimed at harmonizing technical requirements for veterinary product registration, they can be utilized by regulatory bodies in the European Union, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.
Effectiveness. Early pilot studies may be conducted in laboratory cats and dogs to establish effectiveness and the dose range for each product. Data on how well the drug is absorbed when dosed by different routes of administration and the relationship of the dose to the effectiveness are studied. When an effective dose is established, a study protocol to test the product in real world conditions is developed prior to beginning the study. In the case of the FDA, the pivotal effectiveness field study protocol can be submitted for review and concurrence prior to study initiation, to help assure that the data generated will meet requirements.
The pivotal field effectiveness study must be conducted with the formulation of the product that is intended to be commercialized, and is a multi-site, randomized, controlled study, generally with a placebo control. To reduce bias in the study, individuals doing the assessment are not told whether the subject is in the group receiving the treatment being tested or the placebo group. In both the United States and the European Union, the number of subjects enrolled in pivotal field effectiveness studies is required to be approximately 

100 to 150 animal subjects treated with the test product and a comparable number of subjects in the control group that receive the placebo. In many cases, a pivotal field study may be designed with clinical sites in both the European Union and the United States, and this single study may satisfy regulatory requirements in both jurisdictions.
Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls ("CMC"). To assure that the product can be manufactured consistently, regulatory agencies will require us to provide documentation of the process by which the API is made and the controls applicable to that process that assure the API and the formulation of the final commercial product meet certain criteria, including quality, purity and stability. After a product is approved, we will be required to communicate with the regulatory bodies any changes in the procedures or manufacturing site. Both API and commercial formulations are required to be manufactured at facilities that practice pharmaceutical GMP.
Environmental and Human Safety. We will not be required under United States law to provide an environmental impact statement for products currently in development if the products are given at the home of the pet’s owner or in a veterinary hospital. If products might result in some type of environmental exposure or release, the environmental impact must be assessed. For approval in the EU, a risk assessment for potential human exposure will be required.
Labeling, All Other Information, and Freedom of Information Summary. We also will be required to submit the intended label for the product, and also any information regarding additional research that has been conducted with the drug, to the CVM and other regulatory bodies for review. We will draft, and submit for regulatory review, the Freedom of Information Summary for use in the United States. This summary outlines the studies and provides substantial information that the FDA uses to assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness and then publishes on its website. 
Regulatory Process at the FDA 
To begin the development process for products in the United States, we must file an Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD) submission with the FDA. We will then usually hold a pre-development meeting with the FDA to reach a general agreement on the plans for providing the data necessary to fulfill requirements for an NADA. We evaluate if drug candidates can benefit from approval under the minor use minor species (MUMS) or expanded conditional approval programs. During development, we will usually submit pivotal protocols to the FDA for review and concurrence prior to conducting the required studies. We will gather and submit data on manufacturing, safety and effectiveness to the FDA for review, and this review will be conducted according to timelines specified in the Animal Drug User Fee Act. These are called technical sections, which collectively form the basis of the NADA. Once all data have been submitted and reviewed for each technical section - safety, effectiveness and CMC - the FDA will issue us a technical section complete letter as each section review is completed, and when the three letters have been issued, we will compile a draft of the Freedom of Information Summary, the proposed labeling, and all other relevant information, and submit these for FDA review. An administrative NADA is a NADA that is submitted after all of the technical sections that fulfill the requirements for the approval of the new animal drug have been reviewed by the CVM and the CVM has issued a technical section complete letter for each of those technical sections. Although this process is not required and submission of a non-administrative NADA is also acceptable, we plan to take advantage of the administrative NADA process to obtain a more timely, phased review. Because the CVM has already reviewed the individual technical sections before the administrative NADA is filed, the CVM is committed under its user fee agreements to reviewing and acting on 90% of administrative NADAs within 60 days after submission. The CVM user fee goal is to review and act on 90% of non-administrative NADAs within 180 days after submission. After approval, we will be required to collect reports of adverse events and product quality complaints, and submit them on a regular basis to the FDA.

Regulatory Process at the USDA 
To begin the development process for veterinary biologics products in the United States, we typically file an Application for United States Veterinary Biological Product License with the USDA. For the biologics products that we develop, we may then meet with the USDA to reach a general agreement on the plans for providing the data necessary to fulfill requirements for an approval. During development, we gather and submit data on manufacturing, purity and potency to the USDA for review. Once all data have been submitted and reviewed, the USDA will issue its decision. Unlike the FDA, there are no timelines specified by law for the USDA’s review. 
In some cases, it may be unclear whether our product candidates meet the definition of a biological product subject to regulation by the USDA or a drug subject to regulation by the FDA. The USDA’s Center for Veterinary Biologics and the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine have a memorandum of understanding concerning their joint responsibilities for resolving jurisdictional issues over products of this nature. Under the memorandum of understanding, animal products are to be regulated by the USDA as biologics if they are intended for use to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease in animals and they work primarily through an immune process, or by the FDA as drugs, if they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of animal disease if the primary mechanism of action is not immunological or is undefined. There is a process to gain a jurisdiction decision. 
Regulatory Process at the EMA 
The EMA is responsible for coordinating scientific evaluation of applications for marketing approval for pet therapeutics in the EU. Its veterinary review section is distinct from the review section for human drugs. To perform these evaluations the EMA established a specific scientific committee, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ("CVMP"). The CVMP considers applications submitted by companies for the marketing approval of individual pet therapeutics and evaluates whether or not the medicines meet the necessary quality, safety and efficacy requirements. Assessments conducted by the CVMP are based on scientific criteria and are intended to ensure that pet therapeutics reaching the marketplace have a positive benefit-risk balance in the pet population for which they are intended. Based on the CVMP’s recommendation, a centralized marketing authorization is granted by the EMA, which allows the product to be marketed in any of the EU states, Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland. The CVMP is also responsible for various post-authorization and maintenance activities, including the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. 
To obtain authorization from the EMA, we must submit a marketing authorization application called a dossier. The dossier is the EMA’s equivalent of the FDA’s NADA and includes data from studies showing the quality, safety and efficacy of the product. The CVMP reviews and evaluates the dossier. For any dossier, a rapporteur and co-rapporteur are appointed from the members of the CVMP. Their role is to lead the scientific evaluation and prepare the assessment report. The rapporteur can utilize experts to assist it in performing its assessment. The report is critiqued by the co-rapporteur and other members of the CVMP before the CVMP makes its determination. The final opinion of the CVMP is generally given within 210 days of the submission of a dossier, but the EMA makes the final decision on the approval of products. In general, the requirements for regulatory approval of an animal health product in the EU are similar to those in the United States, requiring demonstrated evidence of purity, safety, efficacy and consistency of manufacturing processes. 
Alternatively, product approval applications may be submitted directly to the regulatory authority in each country rather than by centralized approval by the EMA. 
Regulatory Processes at the DEA 
The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. An animal drug may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to 

present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Certain of our product candidates are likely to be scheduled as controlled substances under the CSA. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use will be subject to a high degree of regulation. 
Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. 
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports must be made to the DEA, for example, distribution reports for Schedule II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports. 
In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. 
Other Regulatory Considerations 
Regulatory rules relating to human food safety, food additives, or drug residues in food will not apply to the products we currently are developing because our products are not intended for use in food animals or food production animals, with the exception of horses, which qualify as food animals in Europe and Canada. 
Advertising and promotion of animal health products is controlled by regulations in the United States and other countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and authorized by the applicable agency. We will conduct a review of advertising and promotional material for compliance with local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell pet therapeutics. 
While small molecule product drugs may eventually face generic competition in the United States, there is no pathway for approval of a generic veterinary biologic regulated by the USDA.
Human Capital
Our success depends on our ability to retain and attract the top talent. We offer a diverse, safe and fun workplace for our employees to grow and develop in their careers. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 63 employees, including 11 employees with D.V.M., M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Of our employees, 17, including Dr. Chin, are engaged in one or more aspects of our research and development activities. Dr. Chin also is engaged in corporate and administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Diversity and Inclusion

As of December 31, 2020, our employee base was comprised of 46% females and 54% males, and of the following ethnicities: 34% Asian, 59% White, 3% Hispanic, 3% two or more ethnicities and 1% additional groups (including American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). We will also continue our ongoing efforts to increase the representation of women in leadership.
We diversify our workforce through recruiting, retention, people development, and inclusion. We create more opportunities to consider qualified people from underrepresented groups for open roles. We promote an inclusive workplace by helping people understand the issues that affect underrepresented communities and how to reduce the effects of bias in the workplace.
Compensation and Benefits
We offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people to work on our mission. Our employees' total compensation package includes salary, bonuses, and equity. We offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual equity grants because we want them to become owners of the company and be committed to our long-term success. We ensure fair and equitable pay across gender and race in the United States for people in similar jobs, accounting for factors such as location, role, and level. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, and paid-time off, including healthcare and wellness benefits, family care resources, a 401(k) plan.
Health, Safety, Wellness and Covid-19 responses
We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health and wellness programs. We encourage employees to engage in healthy behaviors, and we offer choices where possible so they are customized to meet their needs and the needs of their families.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we made important trainings and changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, and the communities in which we operate, in compliance with government regulations. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
