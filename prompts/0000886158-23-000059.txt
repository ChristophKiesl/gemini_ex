Digital purchases, including web and mobile, can be shipped to a customer from our distribution facilities, directly from vendors, or from a store. Store purchases are primarily fulfilled from that store's inventory or may also be shipped to a customer from one of our distribution facilities, from a vendor, or from another store.

Recent Developments
Chapter 11 Bankruptcy
On April 23, 2023 (the “Petition Date”), the Company and materially all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors” or the “Company Parties”) filed voluntary petitions (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey (the “Bankruptcy Court”). On the Petition Date, the Company Parties filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to jointly administer the Chapter 11 Cases. On April 24, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving joint administration under the caption “In re Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.,” Case No. 23-13359. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries were not included in the Chapter 11 filing.
The Company Parties continue to operate their business and manage their properties as “debtors-in-possession" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The Company Parties filed with the Bankruptcy Court motions seeking a variety of “first-day” relief, including authority to pay employee wages and benefits and to pay vendors and suppliers for goods and services provided both before and after the Petition Date. In addition, the Company filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion seeking approval (“Interim DIP Order”) of debtor-in-possession financing (“DIP Financing”) in the form of the DIP Credit Agreement (as defined and described below). Following a hearing held on April 24, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Company Parties’ motions seeking a variety of “first-day” relief on an interim basis. The Company Parties resolved numerous informal comments and many of the "first-day" motions were entered on a final basis consensually. A hearing was scheduled on June 14, 2023 for the Bankruptcy Court to consider final approval of the relief requested in certain first day motions, and final approval of the DIP Facility. 
DIP Credit Agreement
Prior to the Petition Date, the Company Parties and Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc., Sixth Street Lending Partners and TAO Talents (the “DIP Parties”) agreed to enter into a senior secured super-priority debtor-in-possession term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $240,000,000 subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein (the “DIP Credit Agreement”). On April 25, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving entry into the DIP Credit Facility on an interim basis. Pursuant to the DIP Credit Agreement, the DIP Lenders have provided a senior secured super-priority debtor in possession term loan facility (the “DIP Facility”), consisting of (1) a new money single draw term loan facility in the amount of $40 million, and (2) a roll-up of certain secured obligations under the existing prepetition credit agreement between the Company Parties and the Prepetition FILO Lenders in the amount of $200 million. Borrowings under the DIP Facility are senior secured obligations of the Company and certain Company Parties, secured by a super priority lien on the collateral under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2021 (as amended by that certain First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2022, that certain Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Waiver, dated as of February 7, 2023, that certain Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Waiver, dated as of March 6, 2023, that certain Fourth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Waiver, dated as of March 30, 2023, that certain Fifth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Waiver, dated as of April 6, 2023 and that certain Sixth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, Consent and Waiver, dated as of April 21, 2023, the “Existing Credit Agreement”), as well as all unencumbered assets of the Company Parties (subject to customary exceptions). The DIP Credit Agreement has various customary covenants, as well as covenants mandating compliance by the Debtors with a 13-week budget, variance testing and reporting requirements, among others. The proceeds of all or a portion of the proposed DIP Credit Agreements may be used for, among other things, post-petition working capital for the Company and its subsidiaries, payment of costs to administer the Chapter 11 Cases, payment of expenses and fees of the transactions contemplated by the Chapter 11 Cases, payment of court-approved adequate protection obligations under the DIP Credit Agreements, and payment of other costs, in each case, subject to an approved budget and such other purposes permitted under the DIP Credit Agreement and the Interim DIP Order or any other order of the Bankruptcy Court.
The Company Parties are seeking final approval of the DIP Credit Agreement at a hearing before the Bankruptcy Court, contemplated to occur on or about June 14, 2023.
Nasdaq Delisting Proceedings
On April 24, 2023, the Company received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that, as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases and in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and IM-5101-1, Nasdaq had determined that the Company’s common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq Trading of the Company’s common stock was suspended at the opening of business on May 3, 2023.
Following delisting from Nasdaq, the Company’s common stock has been quoted in the OTC Pink Open Market under the symbol “BBBYQ”. The OTC Pink Open Market is a significantly more limited market than Nasdaq, and quotation on the OTC Pink Open Market likely results in a less liquid market for existing and potential holders of the common stock to trade the Company’s common stock and could further depress the trading price of the common stock. The Company can provide no assurance as to 
Table of Contents

whether broker-dealers will continue to provide public quotes of the common stock on this market, or whether the trading volume of the common stock will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market.
We expect Nasdaq to file a Form 25 with the SEC to delist our common stock from trading on Nasdaq and to remove it from registration under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, which will become effective 10 days after such filing. In accordance with Rule 12d2-2 of the Exchange Act, the de-registration of our common stock under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act will become effective 90 days, or such shorter period as the SEC may determine, from the date of the Form 25 filing. 
Appointment of Chief Restructuring Officer
Effective on April 22, 2023, the Company appointed Holly Etlin to serve as the Chief Restructuring Officer (“CRO”) of the Company for such a term and in accordance with the terms and conditions of that certain engagement letter, dated as of April 21, 2023 by and among and the Company and AP Services, LLC (the “AP Engagement Letter”). As further set forth in the AP Engagement Letter, Ms. Etlin’s authority as CRO includes, in coordination with the Company’s advisors and management, (a) overseeing the Chapter 11 Cases and court-supervised liquidation and sale process, (b) overseeing cash management and liquidity forecasting, (c) the development of, or revisions to, the Company’s business plan, and (d) engagement with creditors and other stakeholders.

See "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for detailed information relating to these divestitures.
Fiscal 2022 Strategic Transformation
Beginning in the third quarter of Fiscal 2022, we underwent significant strategic and management changes to transform our business and adapt to the dynamic retail environment and the evolving needs of our customers in order to position ourselves for long-term success. The Company began to execute a comprehensive strategic plan led by our new President and Chief Executive Officer, Sue Gove, who was appointed in October 2022 after serving as Interim Chief Executive Officer. 
•Change in leadership and strategy: We realigned our organizational structure, which included the creation of Brand President roles for Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY to lead merchandising, planning, brand marketing, site merchandising and stores for each banner.
•Owned Brands: We exited a third of our Owned Brands, including the discontinuation of three of our nine labels (Haven™, Wild Sage™ and Studio 3B™). We also expect to reduce the breadth and depth of inventory across our six remaining Owned Brands (Simply Essential™, Nestwell™, Our Table™, Squared Away™, H for Happy™ and Everhome™).
•Introduction of Welcomes Rewards: During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we launched our cross-banner customer loyalty program, Welcome Rewards™, which allows members to earn points for each qualifying purchase at its retail banners either online or in its stores. Points earned are then converted to rewards upon reaching certain thresholds.
•Right-sizing cost structure and store fleets to better serve customers: We increased our focus on strategic investments in technologies, capabilities and services, store maintenance, and the expansion of digital offerings and services. We also initiated a strategic revaluation of store remodel plans and returns given changes in customer shopping and service.
•Supporting the growth of buybuy BABY: We began to expand as we worked to become a solution for parents from pre-natal to pre-school. During Fiscal 2022, we launched the first two exclusive buybuy Baby brands, Mighty Goods™ and Ever & Ever™ which are available exclusively at buybuy BABY stores and online at buybuyBABY.com.

Rebalancing our Merchandise
In conjunction with the Company’s new strategic focus areas, the Company executed plans to rebalance our merchandise assortment to align with customer preference by leading with National Brands inventory and introducing new, emerging direct-to-consumer brands. Consequently, we announced the exiting of a third of our Owned Brands, including the discontinuation of a third of our nine labels (Haven™, Wild Sage™ and Studio 3B™). We also expect to reduce the breadth and depth of inventory across our six remaining Owned Brands (Simply Essential™, Nestwell™, Our Table™, Squared Away™, H for Happy™ and Everhome™).
Exit from Harmon, Decorist and Canadian Operations
We have continued to create a more focused portfolio, including through the exit of unprofitable businesses such as our Harmon, Decorist and Canada operations. On September 26, 2022, we announced Decorist, an e-design platform we acquired in 2017, would wind down existing projects by October 12, 2022. On January 30, 2023, we announced plans to close all of our Harmon beauty product stores. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, we begun the exit of our Canadian operations.
On February 10, 2023 (the “Canadian Petition Date”), BBB Canada Limited made an application with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (the “Canadian Court”). BBB Canada Limited was granted an order, which, among other provisions, provides a stay of proceedings pursuant to the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (the “CCAA”). The CCAA is a Federal Act that allows financially troubled corporations that owe their creditors in excess of $5 million the opportunity to restructure their affairs. Although Bed Bath & Beyond Canada L.P. (“BBB LP” and together with BBB Canada Limited, “BBB Canada”) did not file an application with the Canadian Court, the stay of proceedings under the CCAA and other benefits were extended to BBB LP. BBB Canada initiated a wind-down of Bed Bath & Beyond and Buy Buy Baby Stores in Canada under the CCAA. A monitor was appointed by the Canadian Court on February 10, 2023 to oversee the orderly liquidation of its remaining inventory with assistance from a third-party professional liquidator and vacate its leased retail stores and premises.
Financial Position Realignment

The Company focused on its financial position with the following efforts prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases:
•Right-sizing cost structure and infrastructure to reflect business operations: We initiated a strategic revaluation of our overall expense and operational structure to align with business performance and target profitability.

In conjunction with these changes, the Company has eliminated the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Stores Officer, Chief Merchandising Officer, Chief Customer Officer and Chief Growth Officer roles.
•Supply chain optimization: We completed a supply chain network study to improve cost to serve and time to deliver for our customers by streamlining fulfillment center and distribution center operations.
•Supporting our supplier and vendor partners: The Company’s teams worked closely with supplier and vendor partners to ensure customers have access to a strong assortment of their favorite brands across both store and digital channels. The customer experience is our top priority and we made meaningful progress to improve our business and calibrate to customer demand. In addition to leveraging our recent capital to reinvest in high demand inventory, we also worked to develop a third-party consignment program to allow us to fortify our product assortments by expanding merchandise availability from key supplier partners. 
•Obtaining additional capital: On February 7, 2023, the Company consummated an underwritten public offering of (i) shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A”), (ii) warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock (“Common Stock Warrants”), and (iii) warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock Warrants”).
