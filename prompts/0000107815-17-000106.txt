Total operating revenues (1) | $ | 3,440.6 | | | $ | 3,454.4 | | $ | 3,445.2


(1) | Includes distribution sales for customers who have purchased power from an alternative electric supplier in Michigan.


(2) | Includes SSR revenues and other revenues, partially offset by revenues from the mines that are being deferred until a future rate proceeding. For more information, see the discussion below under the heading "Large Electric Retail Customers."

Electric Sales
Our electric energy deliveries included supply and distribution sales to retail and wholesale customers and distribution sales to those customers who switched to an alternative electric supplier. In 2016, retail electric revenues accounted for 87.5% of total electric operating revenues, while wholesale and resale electric revenues accounted for 9.1% of total electric operating revenues. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Utility Segment Contribution to Operating Income for information on MWh sales by customer class.
We are authorized to provide retail electric service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities. Through December 31, 2016, we were authorized to provide electric service in certain territories in the state of Michigan pursuant to franchises granted by municipalities. We will continue to provide service to the Tilden mine located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan pursuant to a contract between Tilden and us until UMERC's proposed generation begins commercial operation. See Note 20, Regulatory Environment, for more information.
We buy and sell wholesale electric power by participating in the MISO Energy Markets. The cost of our individual generation offered into the MISO Energy Markets, compared to our competitors, affects how often our generating units are dispatched and how we buy and sell power. For more information, see Item 1. Business – D. Regulation.
Steam Sales
We have a steam utility that generates, distributes, and sells steam supplied by VAPP to customers in metropolitan Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Steam is used by customers for processing, space heating, domestic hot water, and humidification. Annual sales of steam fluctuate from year to year based on system growth and variations in weather conditions. In April 2016, we sold the MCPP steam generation and distribution assets, located in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. MCPP primarily provided steam to the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center hospitals and other campus buildings. See Note 3, Dispositions, for more information. 
Electric Sales Forecast
Our service territory experienced slightly declining weather-normalized retail electric sales in 2016, as positive customer growth was more than offset by reduced volumes related to lower use per customer. We currently forecast retail electric sales volumes and the associated peak demand, excluding the Tilden mine located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, to remain flat over the next five years, assuming normal weather.

Large Electric Retail Customers
We provide electric utility service to a diversified base of customers in such industries as governmental, mining, food products, health services, foundry, paper, printing, and retail. In February 2015, our largest retail electric customers, two iron ore mines located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, returned as customers after choosing an alternative electric supplier in September 2013. For more information on alternative electric suppliers, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Industry Restructuring. We entered into a contract with each of the mines to provide full requirements electric service through December 31, 2019. Since 2015, we have been deferring, and expect to continue to defer the revenue less cost of sales, from the mine sales and will apply these amounts for the benefit of Wisconsin retail electric customers in a future rate proceeding. 
In 2016, one of the iron ore mines closed, and the related contract for full requirements electric service was terminated. In August 2016, WEC Energy Group entered into a new agreement with the owner of the remaining mine under which it will purchase electric power from UMERC for 20 years. The agreement also calls for UMERC to construct and operate certain natural gas-fired generation located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The remaining iron ore mine will continue to receive full requirements electric service from us under the existing contract, as discussed above, until UMERC's proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan begins commercial operation. See Note 4, Related Parties, and Note 20, Regulatory Environment, for more information. 
Wholesale Customers
We provide wholesale electric service to various customers, including electric cooperatives, municipal joint action agencies, other investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities, and energy marketers. Wholesale sales accounted for 3.2%, 3.4%, and 5.3% of total electric energy sales during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Wholesale revenues accounted for 2.6%, 2.9%, and 3.8% of total electric operating revenues during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Resale
The majority of our sales for resale are sold to one RTO, MISO, at market rates based on availability of our generation and RTO demand. Resale sales accounted for 23.0%, 23.8%, and 18.5% of total electric energy sales during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Resale revenues accounted for 6.5%, 6.6%, and 7.7% of total electric operating revenues during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Retail fuel costs are reduced by the amount that revenue exceeds the costs of sales derived from these opportunity sales.
Electric Generation and Supply Mix
Our electric supply strategy is to provide our customers with energy from plants using a diverse fuel mix that is expected to maintain a stable, reliable, and affordable supply of electricity. Through our participation in the MISO Energy Markets, we supply a significant amount of electricity to our customers from power plants that we own or lease from We Power. We supplement our internally generated power supply with long-term power purchase agreements, including the Point Beach power purchase agreement discussed under the heading "Power Purchase Commitments," and through spot purchases in the MISO Energy Markets. We also sell excess capacity into the MISO Energy Markets when it is economical, which reduces net fuel costs by offsetting costs of purchased power.

2016 Form 10-K | 5 | Wisconsin Electric Power Company

Our rated capacity by fuel type, including the units we lease from We Power, as of December 31 is shown below. For more information on our electric generation facilities, see Item 2. Properties. 

 | Rated Capacity in MW (1)
 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014

Renewables (4) | 190 | | 187 | | 155 
Total rated capacity | 6,114 | | 6,060 | | 6,024


(1) | Rated capacity is the net power output under average operating conditions with equipment in an average state of repair as of a given month in a given year. We are a summer peaking electric utility, and amounts are based on expected capacity ratings for the following summer. The values were established by tests and may change slightly from year to year.


(2) | The natural gas steam turbine represents the rated capacity associated with the VAPP Units, which were converted from coal to natural gas in 2014 and 2015.


(3) | The dual-fueled facilities generally burn oil only if natural gas is not available due to constraints on the natural gas pipeline and/or at the local natural gas distribution company that delivers natural gas to the plants.


(4) | Includes hydroelectric, biomass, and wind generation.

The table below indicates our sources of electric energy supply as a percentage of sales for the three years ended December 31, as well as estimates for 2017:

Coal-Fired Generation
Our coal-fired generation, including the units we lease from We Power, consists of four operating plants with a rated capacity of 3,582 MW as of December 31, 2016. For more information about our operating plants, see Item 2. Properties. 
Natural Gas-Fired Generation
Our natural gas-fired generation, including the units we lease from We Power, consists of four operating plants, including peaking units, with a rated capacity of 2,162 MW as of December 31, 2016. For more information about our operating plants, see Item 2. Properties. 

2016 Form 10-K | 6 | Wisconsin Electric Power Company

Oil-Fired Generation
Fuel oil is used for combustion turbines at certain of our natural gas-fired plants as well as for ignition and flame stabilization at one of our coal-fired plants. Our oil-fired generation had a rated capacity of 180 MW as of December 31, 2016. We also have natural gas-fired peaking units with a rated capacity of 782 MW, which have the ability to burn oil if natural gas is not available due to delivery constraints. For more information about our operating plants, see Item 2. Properties. 
Renewable Generation
In order to comply with renewable energy legislation in Wisconsin and Michigan, we meet a portion of our electric generation supply with various renewable energy resources. 
Hydroelectric
Our hydroelectric generating system consists of 13 operating plants with both a total installed capacity and a rated capacity of 89 MW as of December 31, 2016. All of our hydroelectric facilities follow FERC guidelines and/or regulations. 
Wind
We have four wind sites, consisting of 200 turbines, with an installed capacity of 339 MW and a rated capacity of 51 MW as of December 31, 2016. 
Biomass
We have a biomass-fueled power plant at a Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings are used to produce a rated capacity of approximately 50 MW of electric power as well as steam to support the paper mill's operations. Fuel for the power plant is supplied by both the paper mill and through contracts with biomass suppliers.
Generation from Leased We Power Units
We also supply electricity to our customers from power plants that we lease from We Power. These plants include the ERGS units and the PWGS units. Lease payments are billed from We Power to us and then recovered in our rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC, and the FERC. We operate the We Power units and are authorized by the PSCW and state law to fully recover prudently incurred operating and maintenance costs in our Wisconsin electric rates. As the operator of the units, we may request We Power to make capital improvements to, or further investments in, the units. Under the lease terms, these capital improvements or further investments will increase lease payments paid by us and should ultimately be recovered in our rates.
Electric System Reliability
The PSCW requires us to maintain a planning reserve margin above our projected annual peak demand forecast to help ensure reliability of electric service to our customers. These planning reserve requirements are consistent with the MISO calculated planning reserve margin. In 2008, the PSCW established a 14.5% reserve margin requirement for long-term planning (planning years two through ten). For short-term planning (planning year one), the PSCW requires Wisconsin utilities to follow the planning reserve margin established by MISO. MISO has a 15.2% reserve margin requirement for the planning year from June 1, 2016, through May 31, 2017. Although MISO's short-term reserve margin changes from year-to-year, fluctuations are typically less than 0.5%. The MPSC does not have minimum guidelines for future supply reserves. 
We had adequate capacity through company-owned generation units, leased generating units, and power purchase contracts to meet the MISO calculated planning reserve margin during 2016 and expect to have adequate capacity to meet the planning reserve margin requirements during 2017. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability across the 15-state MISO footprint could require us to call upon load management procedures. Load management procedures allow for the reduction of energy use through agreements with customers to directly shut off their equipment or through interruptible service, where customers agree to reduce their load in the case of an emergency interruption.

2016 Form 10-K | 7 | Wisconsin Electric Power Company

Fuel and Purchased Power Costs
Our retail electric rates in Wisconsin are established by the PSCW and include base amounts for fuel and purchased power costs. The electric fuel rules set by the PSCW allow us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, under or over-collections of actual fuel and purchased power costs that exceed a 2% price variance from the costs included in the rates charged to customers. For more information about the fuel rules, see Item 1. Business – D. Regulation.
Our average fuel and purchased power costs per MWh by fuel type were as follows for the years ended December 31:

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Coal | $ | 22.68 | | | $ | 25.25 | | $ | 27.68
Natural gas combined cycle | 19.13 | | | 23.44 | | | 40.64 
Natural gas/oil peaking units | 46.99 | | | 56.33 | | | 129.83
Purchased power | 43.51 | | | 43.87 | | | 47.47 

We purchase coal under long-term contracts, which helps with price stability. Coal and associated transportation services have continued to see volatility in pricing due to changing domestic and world-wide demand for coal and the impacts of diesel costs, which are incorporated into fuel surcharges on rail transportation. Certain of our coal transportation contracts contain fuel cost adjustments that are tied to changes in diesel fuel and crude oil prices. Currently, diesel fuel contracts are not actively traded. Therefore, we use financial heating oil contracts to mitigate risk related to diesel fuel prices. 
We purchase natural gas for our plants on the spot market from natural gas marketers, utilities, and producers, and we arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants. We have firm and interruptible transportation, as well as balancing and storage agreements, intended to support our plants' variable usage. 
We have a PSCW-approved hedging program that allows us to hedge up to 75% of our potential risks related to fuel surcharge exposure. We also have a program that allows us to hedge up to 75% of our estimated natural gas use for electric generation in order to help manage our natural gas price risk. These hedging programs are generally implemented on a 36-month forward-looking basis. The results of these programs are reflected in the average costs of natural gas and purchased power. 
Coal Supply
We diversify the coal supply for our electric generating facilities by purchasing coal from several mines in Wyoming, as well as from various other states. For 2017, approximately 81% of our total projected coal requirements of approximately 10 million tons are contracted under fixed-price contracts. See Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information on amounts of coal purchases and coal deliveries under contract.
The annual tonnage amounts contracted for the next three years are as follows:

(in thousands) | Annual Tonnage
2017 | 7,934 
2018 | 6,120 
2019 | 3,132 

Coal Deliveries
All of our 2017 coal requirements are expected to be shipped by our owned or leased unit trains under existing transportation agreements. The unit trains transport the coal for electric generating facilities from mines in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, and Montana. The coal is transported by train to our rail-served electric-generating facilities and to dock storage in Superior, Wisconsin, until needed by our lake vessel-served facilities. Additional small volume agreements may also be used to supplement the normal coal supply for our facilities.
Midcontinent Independent System Operator Costs
In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed and operates the MISO Energy Markets, which include its bid-based energy markets and ancillary services market. We are a participant in the MISO Energy Markets. For more information on MISO, see Item 1. Business – D. Regulation.

2016 Form 10-K | 8 | Wisconsin Electric Power Company

Power Purchase Commitments
We enter into short and long-term power purchase commitments to meet a portion of our anticipated electric energy supply needs. As of December 31, 2016, our power purchase commitments with unaffiliated parties for the next five years are 1,279 MW per year. This amount includes 1,033 MW per year related to a long-term power purchase agreement for electricity generated by Point Beach. 
Other Matters
Seasonality
Our electric utility sales are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions. We sell more electricity during the summer months because of the residential cooling load. We continue to upgrade our electric distribution system, including substations, transformers, and lines, to meet the demand of our customers. Our generating plants performed as expected during the warmest periods of the summer, and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, we did not require public appeals for conservation, and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non-firm customers who participate in load management programs. 
Competition
We face competition from various entities and other forms of energy sources available to customers, including self-generation by large industrial customers and alternative energy sources. We compete with other utilities for sales to municipalities and cooperatives as well as with other utilities and marketers for wholesale electric business. 
For more information on competition in our service territories, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Industry Restructuring.
Environmental Matters
For information regarding environmental matters, especially as they relate to coal-fired generating facilities, see Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies. 
NATURAL GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS
We are authorized to provide retail natural gas distribution service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities. We also transport customer-owned natural gas. We operate in three distinct service areas including west and south of the City of Milwaukee, the Appleton area, and areas within Iron and Vilas Counties, Wisconsin.

* | Includes amounts (refunded to) collected from customers for purchased gas adjustment costs.

Natural Gas Deliveries
Our gas therm deliveries include customer-owned transported natural gas. Transported natural gas accounted for approximately 38.0% of the total volumes delivered during 2016, 36.4% during 2015, and 33.7% during 2014. Our peak daily send-out during 2016 was 7.0 million therms on January 18, 2016.
Large Natural Gas Customers
We provide natural gas utility service to a diversified base of industrial customers who are largely within our electric service territory. Major industries served include governmental, food products, education, metals, and real estate.
Natural Gas Sales Forecast
Our service territory experienced growth in weather-normalized retail natural gas deliveries (excluding natural gas deliveries for electric generation) in 2016 due to positive customer growth, an improving economy, and favorable natural gas prices. We currently forecast retail natural gas delivery volumes to grow at a rate between flat and 0.5% over the next five years, assuming normal weather. The forecast projects positive customer growth being offset by energy efficiency.
Natural Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage
We have been able to meet our contractual obligations with both our suppliers and our customers. For more information on our natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts, see Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies.
Pipeline Capacity and Storage
The interstate pipelines serving Wisconsin originate in major natural gas producing areas of North America: the Oklahoma and Texas basins, western Canada, and the Rocky Mountains. We have contracted for long-term firm capacity from a number of these sources. This strategy reflects management's belief that overall supply security is enhanced by geographic diversification of the supply portfolio. 
Due to the daily and seasonal variations in natural gas usage in Wisconsin, we have also contracted for substantial underground storage capacity, primarily in Michigan. We target storage inventory levels at approximately 35% of forecasted winter demand; November through March is considered the winter season. Storage capacity, along with our natural gas purchase contracts, enables 

2016 Form 10-K | 10 | Wisconsin Electric Power Company

us to manage significant changes in daily demand and to optimize our overall natural gas supply and capacity costs. We generally inject natural gas into storage during the spring and summer months when demand is lower and withdraw it in the winter months. As a result, we can contract for less long-line pipeline capacity during periods of peak usage than would otherwise be necessary and can purchase natural gas on a more uniform daily basis from suppliers year-round. Each of these capabilities enables us to reduce our overall costs.
We hold daily transportation and storage capacity entitlements with interstate pipeline companies as well as other service providers under varied-length long-term contracts.
In January 2017, our parent company signed an agreement for the acquisition of a natural gas storage facility in Michigan that would provide for some of our storage needs for our natural gas utility operations. We plan to enter into a long-term service agreement to take the allocated storage, subject to PSCW approval and closing of the acquisition. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information on this transaction.
Term Natural Gas Supply
We have contracts for firm supplies with terms of 3–5 months with suppliers for natural gas acquired in the Chicago, Illinois market hub and in the producing areas discussed above. The pricing of the term contracts is based upon first of the month indices.
Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of natural gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day and seasonal demand. Our forecasted design peak-day throughput is 9.6 million therms for the 2016 through 2017 heating season.
Secondary Market Transactions
Pipeline and storage capacity and natural gas supplies under contract can be resold in secondary markets. Local distribution companies, like our natural gas operations, must contract for capacity and supply sufficient to meet the firm peak-day demand of their customers. Peak or near peak demand days generally occur only a few times each year. The secondary markets facilitate higher utilization of contracted capacity and supply during those times when the full contracted capacity and supply are not needed by the utility, helping to mitigate the fixed costs associated with maintaining peak levels of capacity and natural gas supply. Through pre-arranged agreements and day-to-day electronic bulletin board postings, interested parties can purchase this excess capacity and supply. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to customers, subject to our approved GCRM. During 2016, we continued to participate in the secondary markets. For information on our GCRM, see Note 1(d), Revenues and Customer Receivables.
Spot Market Natural Gas Supply
We expect to continue to make natural gas purchases in the spot market as price and other circumstances dictate. We have supply relationships with a number of sellers from whom we purchase natural gas in the spot market.
Hedging Natural Gas Supply Prices
We have PSCW approval to hedge up to 60% of planned winter demand and up to 15% of planned summer demand using a mix of NYMEX-based natural gas options and futures contracts. This approval allows us to pass 100% of the hedging costs (premiums and brokerage fees) and proceeds (gains and losses) to customers through our GCRM. Hedge targets (volumes) are provided annually to the PSCW as part of our three-year natural gas supply plan and risk management filing.
To the extent that opportunities develop and physical supply operating plans are supportive, we also have PSCW approval to utilize NYMEX-based natural gas derivatives to capture favorable forward market price differentials. That approval provides for 100% of the related proceeds to accrue to our GCRM.

Since the majority of our customers use natural gas for heating, customer use is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months. Accordingly, we are subject to some variations in earnings and working capital throughout the year as a result of changes in weather.

2016 Form 10-K | 11 | Wisconsin Electric Power Company

Our working capital needs are met by cash generated from operations and debt (both long-term and short-term). The seasonality of natural gas revenues causes the timing of cash collections to be concentrated from January through June. A portion of our winter natural gas supply needs is typically purchased and stored from April through November. Also, planned capital spending on our natural gas distribution facilities is concentrated in April through November. Because of these timing differences, the cash flow from customers is typically supplemented with temporary increases in short-term borrowings (from external sources) during the late summer and fall. Short-term debt is typically reduced over the January through June period.
Competition
Competition in varying degrees exists between natural gas and other forms of energy available to consumers. A number of our large commercial and industrial customers are dual-fuel customers that are equipped to switch between natural gas and alternative fuels. We are allowed to offer lower-priced natural gas sales and transportation services to dual-fuel customers. Under natural gas transportation agreements, customers purchase natural gas directly from natural gas marketers and arrange with interstate pipelines and us to have the natural gas transported to their facilities. We earn substantially the same operating income whether we sell and transport natural gas to customers or only transport their natural gas.
Our ability to maintain our share of the industrial dual-fuel market depends on our success and the success of third-party natural gas marketers in obtaining long-term and short-term supplies of natural gas at competitive prices compared to other sources and in arranging or facilitating competitively priced transportation service for those customers that desire to buy their own natural gas supplies.
Federal and state regulators continue to implement policies to bring more competition to the natural gas industry. While the natural gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a highly regulated, monopoly function, the sale of the natural gas commodity and related services are expected to remain subject to competition from third parties for large commercial and industrial customers.
C. OTHER SEGMENT
At December 31, 2016, our other segment included Bostco, our non-utility subsidiary, that develops and invests in real estate, as well as equity earnings from our investment in ATC. 
American Transmission Company 
ATC is a regional transmission company that owns, maintains, monitors, and operates electric transmission systems in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and Minnesota. ATC is expected to provide comparable service to all customers, including us, and to support effective competition in energy markets without favoring any market participant. ATC is regulated by the FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is a transmission-owning member of MISO. MISO maintains operational control of ATC's transmission system, and we are a non-transmission owning member and customer of MISO. As of December 31, 2016, our ownership interest in ATC was approximately 23%; however, effective January 1, 2017, we transferred our investment in ATC to another subsidiary of WEC Energy Group. See Note 5, Investment in American Transmission Company, for more information. 
ATC is currently named in a complaint filed with the FERC requesting a reduction in the base ROE used by MISO transmission owners. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Other Matters – American Transmission Company Allowed Return on Equity Complaints, for more information.
D. REGULATION
As of December 31, 2016, we were subject to the requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005) as we met the definition of a holding company under this Act due to our ownership interest in ATC. Effective January 1, 2017, we transferred our investment in ATC to another subsidiary of WEC Energy Group. See Note 5, Investment in American Transmission Company, for more information. As a result, we are no longer subject to the requirements of PUHCA 2005.
In addition to the specific regulations noted below, we are also subject to regulations, where applicable, of the EPA, the WDNR, the MDEQ, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

Rates

Our rates are regulated by the various commissions shown in the table below. These commissions have general supervisory and regulatory powers over public utilities in their respective jurisdictions.

Regulated Rates | Regulatory Commission
Retail electric, natural gas, and steam | PSCW 
Retail electric | MPSC * 
Wholesale power | FERC 


* | Effective January 1, 2017, we transferred all of our electric distribution assets and customers located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to UMERC, with the exception of the Tilden Mining Company. See Note 4, Related Parties, and Note 20, Regulatory Environment, for additional information.

Embedded within our electric rates is an amount to recover fuel and purchased power costs. The Wisconsin retail fuel rules require us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any under-collection or over-collection of fuel and purchased power costs that are outside of our symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW typically sets at plus or minus 2% of our approved fuel and purchased power cost plan. Our deferred fuel and purchased power costs are subject to an excess revenues test. If our ROE in a given year exceeds the ROE authorized by the PSCW, the recovery of under-collected fuel and purchased power costs would be reduced by the amount by which our return exceeds the authorized amount. 
Prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs were recovered dollar-for-dollar from our Michigan retail electric customers and our Wisconsin wholesale electric customers. Our natural gas utility operates under a GCRM as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRM allows for a dollar-for-dollar recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs. 
In May 2015, the PSCW approved the acquisition of Integrys on the condition that we are subject to an earnings sharing mechanism for three years beginning January 1, 2016. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information on this earnings sharing mechanism.
For information on how our rates are set, see Note 20, Regulatory Environment. Orders from our respective regulators can be viewed at the following websites:

Electric Transmission, Capacity, and Energy Markets
In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid-based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO enhanced the energy market by including an ancillary services market. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint, and has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.
In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by load-serving entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. The FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint.
As part of MISO, a market-based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to hedge transmission congestion costs through ARRs and FTRs. ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO, and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction were completed for the period of June 1, 2016, through May 31, 2017. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs are expected to mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.
Beginning June 1, 2013, MISO instituted an annual zonal resource adequacy requirement to ensure there is sufficient generation capacity to serve the MISO market. To meet this requirement, capacity resources could be acquired through MISO's annual capacity auction, bilateral contracts for capacity, or provided from generating or demand response resources. Our capacity requirements during 2016 were fulfilled using our own capacity resources.
Other Electric Regulations
We are subject to the Federal Power Act and the corresponding regulations developed by certain federal agencies. The Energy Policy Act amended the Federal Power Act in 2005 to, among other things, make electric utility industry consolidation more feasible, authorize the FERC to review proposed mergers and the acquisition of generation facilities, change the FERC regulatory scheme applicable to qualifying cogeneration facilities, and modify certain other aspects of energy regulations and Federal tax policies applicable to us. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act created an Electric Reliability Organization to be overseen by the FERC, which established mandatory electric reliability standards and which has the authority to levy monetary sanctions for failure to comply with these standards.
We are subject to Act 141 in Wisconsin and Public Acts 295 and 342 in Michigan, which contain certain minimum requirements for renewable energy generation. See Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information.
All of our hydroelectric facilities follow FERC guidelines and/or regulations.
Other Natural Gas Regulations
Almost all of the natural gas we distribute is transported to our distribution systems by interstate pipelines. The pipelines' transportation and storage services are regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the state commissions are responsible for monitoring and enforcing requirements governing our natural gas safety compliance programs for our pipelines under United States Department of Transportation regulations. These regulations include 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 191 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline; Annual Reports, Incident Reports, and Safety-Related Condition Reports), 49 CFR Part 192 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum Federal Safety Standards), and 49 CFR Part 195 (Transportation of Hazardous Liquids by Pipeline).
We are required to provide natural gas service and grant credit (with applicable deposit requirements) to customers within our service territory. We are generally not allowed to discontinue natural gas service during winter moratorium months to residential heating customers who do not pay their bills. Federal and certain state governments have programs that provide for a limited amount of funding for assistance to our low-income customers.

E. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by state and federal environmental agencies governing air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste management, environmental remediation, and management of natural resources. Costs associated with complying with these requirements are significant. Additional future environmental regulations or revisions to existing laws, including for example, additional regulation of GHG emissions, coal combustion products, air emissions, or wastewater discharges, could significantly increase these environmental compliance costs.
Anticipated expenditures for environmental compliance and remediation issues for the next three years are included in the estimated capital expenditures described in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Requirements. For a discussion of matters related to manufactured gas plant sites and air and water quality, see Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies.
F. EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2016, we had 3,099 employees, of which 3,021 were full-time. 
As of December 31, 2016, we had employees represented under labor agreements with the following bargaining units:
