Item 1. Business.



We are an early stage blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. Since our initial public offering (as described below), we focused our search for an initial business combination on businesses that may provide significant opportunities for attractive investor returns. On March 7, 2022, we merged with and into Merger Sub as part of the Transactions and survived as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alpha Tau.



Initial Public Offering



On January 20, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 27,500,000 units, including 3,500,000 units issued pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the company, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the company, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock for $11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the company of $275,000,000.



Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 6,800,000 warrants to our Sponsor at a purchase price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $6,800,000.



A total of $275,000,000, comprised of $268,200,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and $6,800,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants, was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee.



Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are each traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “HCCCU”, “HCCC” and “HCCCW”, respectively. Our units commenced public trading on January 14, 2021, and our Class A common stock and warrants commenced separate public trading on March 8, 2021.



Business Combination with Alpha Tau



On July 7, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), with Alpha Tau Medical Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the State of Israel (“Alpha Tau”) and Archery Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Alpha Tau (“Merger Sub”). Alpha Tau is a clinical-stage oncology therapeutics company focused on harnessing the innate relative biological effectiveness and short range of alpha particles for use as a localized radiation therapy for solid tumors. Alpha Tau’s proprietary Alpha DaRT technology is designed to utilize the specific therapeutic properties of alpha particles while aiming to overcome, and even harness for potential benefit, the traditional shortcomings of alpha radiation’s limited range. Alpha Tau believes that its Alpha DaRT technology has the potential to be broadly applicable across multiple targets and tumor types.



Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into our Company, with our Company surviving the merger (the “Business Combination”). As a result of the Business Combination, and upon consummation of the Business Combination and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (collectively, the “Transactions”), we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Alpha Tau, with our securityholders becoming securityholders of Alpha Tau.



On March 7, 2022, we merged with and into Merger Sub as part of the Transactions and survived as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alpha Tau. The following securities issuances were be made by Alpha Tau to our securityholders at the Effective Time: (i) each share of our Class A common stock (including shares issuable upon the conversion of our Class B common stock as described below) was exchanged for one Alpha Tau ordinary share and (ii) each outstanding warrant of the Company was assumed by Alpha Tau and became a warrant of Alpha Tau (each, an “Alpha Tau Warrant”) (with the number of Alpha Tau ordinary shares underlying the Alpha Tau Warrants and the exercise price of such Alpha Tau Warrants subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement).



Immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each preferred share of Alpha Tau automatically converted into such number of Alpha Tau ordinary shares as determined in accordance with the existing articles of association of Alpha Tau; (ii) each Alpha Tau ordinary share that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was split into 0.905292 of one Alpha Tau ordinary share (rounded to the nearest whole number) (the “Split Factor”). The Split Factor was set as of the date of the execution of the Merger Agreement and was based upon the agreed pre-money equity value of Alpha Tau (rounded to the nearest whole number) (the “Share Split”); and (iii) outstanding securities convertible into Alpha Tau ordinary shares were adjusted to give effect to the foregoing transactions and remain outstanding. Additionally, concurrently with the closing of the Merger, Alpha Tau issued securities pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, as described in more detail below.

Following the Share Split and immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of our Class B common stock was automatically converted into one share of our Class A common stock and was subsequently exchanged into one Alpha Tau ordinary share, as described above.



PIPE Subscription Agreements



Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Alpha Tau entered into subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”) pursuant to which, among other things, the PIPE Investors have agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and Alpha Tau has agreed to issue and sell to the PIPE Investors, an aggregate of approximately 9,263,006 Alpha Tau ordinary shares (on a post-Share Split basis) for an aggregate purchase price of up to $92,630,060 immediately prior to the Effective Time, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein (the “PIPE”). The Subscription Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of Alpha Tau, on the one hand, and each PIPE Investor, on the other hand, and customary conditions to closing, including the consummation of the Business Combination. The PIPE closed on March 7, 2022.

pursuant to which the Company’s stockholders approved, among others, a proposal to approve and adopt the Business Combination Agreement and Merger and the other proposals that are disclosed in our definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on January 14, 2022 (the “Proxy Statement”).



The number of holders of the Company’s Class A common stock exercising their redemption rights in connection with this vote did not result in the Company having less than $5,000,001 of net tangible assets after giving effect to all holders of public shares that redeemed their shares for cash. The Transactions closed on March 7, 2022, following which we survived as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alpha Tau Alpha Tau’s. began ordinary shares and warrants commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol “DRTS” and “DRTSW,” respectively.

Facilities



Our executive offices were located at 301 North Market Street, Suite 1414, Wilmington, DE 19801 and our telephone number is (561) 810-0031. Our executive offices were provided to us by our Sponsor. We paid our Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for business and administrative support services.
Employees



As of December 31, 2021 we had only two officers. These individuals were not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we completed our initial business combination. The amount of time our officers devoted in any time period varied based on the stage of the initial business combination process we were in. We did not have any full-time employees prior to the completion of the Business Combination. Following the consummation of the Transactions , Uzi Sofer is our sole officer.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information



Prior to the completion of the Transactions, we registered our units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and had reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.

We provided stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements were prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.



We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following January 20, 2026, the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
