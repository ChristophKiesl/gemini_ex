 Item 1. Business.
Our company
We are a pure-play in vitro diagnostics (“IVD”) business, pioneering life-impacting advances in diagnostics for over 80 years, from our earliest work in blood typing, to our innovation in infectious diseases and our latest developments in laboratory solutions. We are driven by our credo, “Because Every Test is A Life.” This guiding principle reflects the crucial role diagnostics play in global health and guides our priorities as an organization. As a leader in IVD, we impact approximately 800,000 patients every day. We are dedicated to improving outcomes for these patients and saving lives through providing innovative and reliable diagnostic testing solutions to the clinical laboratory and transfusion medicine communities. Our global infrastructure and commercial reach allow us to serve these markets with significant scale. We have an intense focus on the customer. We support our customers with high quality diagnostic instrumentation, a broad test portfolio and market leading service. Our products deliver consistently fast, accurate and reliable results that allow clinicians to make better-informed treatment decisions. Our business model generates significant recurring revenues and strong cash flow streams, primarily from the ongoing sales of high margin consumables. In fiscal 2021, these recurring revenues contributed approximately 93% of both our total and core revenue. We maintain close connectivity with our customers through our global presence, with more than 4,800 employees, including approximately 2,300 commercial sales, service and marketing teammates. This global organization allows us to support our customers across more than 130 countries and territories.
 In 2014, we were acquired by The Carlyle Group from Johnson & Johnson and became an independent organization, solely focused on delivering high quality IVD products and service to our diagnostic customer base. At the time of the separation, our business had global scale, a reputation for high quality products, a strong quality management system and a research and development team with extensive scientific expertise. IVD testing is a critical tool in evaluating health in many different settings around the world. IVD is a core component of routine healthcare check-ups for those who are presenting with symptoms or require procedures, and it influences up to 70% of critical healthcare clinical decision-making. Consequently, our IVD solutions have a profound impact on the assessment of health and the delivery of care. IVD is also critical in monitoring the transmission and spread of infectious disease outbreaks, where Ortho’s longstanding excellence in infectious disease testing is particularly relevant. Our solutions are central to the operations of hospitals, clinics, blood banks and donor centers around the world, where they are used to help diagnose certain conditions, such as cancer or heart attacks, and infectious diseases, such as hepatitis, HIV, and most recently, COVID-19, where we have launched four antibody tests and an antigen test, and we are actively expanding our menu of tests to address the global pandemic.
We operate two lines of business, Clinical Laboratories and Transfusion Medicine, which together generate our core revenue:
•Clinical Laboratories: Focused on (i) clinical chemistry, which is the measurement of target chemicals in bodily fluids for the evaluation of health and the clinical management of patients, (ii) immunoassay instruments, which test the measurement of proteins as they act as antigens in the spread of disease, antibodies in the immune response spurred by disease, or markers of proper organ function and health, and (iii) testing to detect and monitor disease progression across a broad spectrum of therapeutic areas, and includes grant revenue related to development of our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests.
 •Transfusion Medicine: Focused on (i) immunohematology instruments and tests used for blood typing to ensure patient-donor compatibility in blood transfusions; and (ii) donor screening instruments and tests used for blood and plasma screening for infectious diseases for customers primarily in the United States.
 Information concerning revenues and long-lived assets attributable to our lines of business and geographic areas is set forth in Note 4–Revenue and Note 19–Segments and geographic information to our audited consolidated financial statements, set forth in “Part IV Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statements Schedules” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Our broad offerings allow us to support our customer base and maximize the opportunity to provide each of our customers with a comprehensive array of products and services over time. We refer to this mutually beneficial approach as focusing on Lifetime Customer Value (“LCV”). Our focus on LCV underpins everything we do, from the design and execution of our commercial and service model, to our instrument and assay innovation, to the composition of our global footprint. Our approach has informed our choice to focus on medium- to high-volume laboratories (our “Focus Markets”), which in turn has helped us become a leader in our Focus Markets and transformed our financial profile. We intend to continue to invest in and evolve our LCV framework to best support our customers and maximize our financial results.
 As an example, we may begin a Clinical Laboratories customer relationship by providing a standalone instrument (often a clinical chemistry analyzer) and a set of assays that are relevant to that customer’s specific testing needs. In 2021, approximately 73% of our Clinical Laboratories installed base was comprised of standalone instruments. As the customer and its testing needs grow, we look to migrate the customer, where appropriate, to an integrated analyzer that performs both clinical chemistry and immunoassay testing. This migration helps us increase our customers’ testing capabilities as well as the revenue we generate from customers. Building on our differentiation in dry chemistry, we grew our integrated instrument installed base at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of

approximately 13% from 2015 to 2021, and in fiscal 2021, approximately 27% of our Clinical Laboratories installed base was comprised of integrated instruments. For our larger customers, we ultimately may expand our testing throughput by installing automation tracks that connect multiple analyzers along the automation track, while providing the full suite of our ever-expanding assay menu. In fiscal 2021, approximately 2% of our Clinical Laboratories installed base was comprised of automated systems. As we have significantly expanded our test menu offering, our integrated analyzers are now more often where our Clinical Laboratories relationship starts. In Transfusion Medicine, the life cycle is similar, as customers graduate from manual testing processes to semi-automated capabilities to fully-automated blood and plasma screening instrumentation as their testing volumes and technical competencies grow over time. In fiscal 2021, our installed base of Immunohematology instruments grew approximately 3%. We focus on building long-term customer relationships and continuing to enhance both our offerings and the customer’s ability to care for their patients, ultimately deepening our commercial relationship and driving our financial model.
 Our competitive strengths
 We believe we are well positioned to drive sustained and profitable growth through our relentless focus on LCV. This customer-centric approach informs the execution of our commercial and service model and underpins our go-to-market strategy. Our customer focus allows us to retain and grow our customers by providing a superior customer experience driven by unparalleled quality of service, continuous innovation and access to a diverse product portfolio. We are able to leverage our global footprint to gain differentiated and leading positions across our Focus Markets. This intense focus on our customers has resulted in an attractive business model with high recurring revenues that allows us to continue to invest to reinforce our competitive strengths, which include:
 Intense customer focus enabled by our broad portfolio and market leading positions
 Our broad portfolio of Clinical Laboratories and Transfusion Medicine instruments covering the full spectrum of manual to fully automated systems allows us to effectively target our Focus Markets. In addition to our instrument portfolio, we offer a diverse menu of assays for the most commonly tested items, including infectious diseases, sepsis, cardiovascular conditions and both blood and plasma typing and screening. Our ability to respond to the full spectrum of our customers’ needs allows us to focus on and enhance LCV. We supplement our instrument and assay offerings with our leading service, commercial, and operational excellence, which we believe improves our customer retention, sales growth and profitability.
 We are a leader in our Focus Markets with leading positions in Clinical Laboratories and Transfusion Medicine. The market opportunities for our Clinical Laboratories and Transfusion Medicine businesses are largely connected and, in both Clinical Laboratories and Transfusion Medicine, we can adapt and grow with our customers as they move from lower throughput to more automated solutions. In addition, we have developed a strategy for new product introductions in order to enhance LCV. For example, in our Transfusion Medicine business, we introduced semi-automated capabilities to increase our participation in certain emerging markets, such as China, Asia Pacific and Latin America, and continue the shift of certain customers from manual to semi-automated testing.
 In Donor Screening, we are a leading player and in late 2020, we won a five-year contract with a five-year extension option with Creative Testing Solutions, the largest U.S. blood donation testing organization, which provides testing for a majority of the U.S. blood supply and is jointly owned by three of the leading U.S. blood service providers: the American Red Cross, OneBlood and Vitalant. Pursuant to this contract, we are Creative Testing Solutions’ primary supplier of serology Donor Screening testing in the United States. This contract provides for collaborative research and development on ours next generation Donor Screening instrument. With renewed commitment to the Donor Screening market and joint innovation with this customer, we believe this relationship has the potential to support further growth in other international Donor Screening markets over time.
 Our business model and customer-centric approach results in strong customer loyalty and a compelling financial profile with greater than 90% recurring revenue during fiscal 2021. The combination of our revenue growth and leading margin profile allows us to reinvest in innovation and commercial opportunities. In addition, we believe our broad portfolio and diversified end markets provide a resilient growth profile. For instance, our strength in acute care and infectious disease testing is durable as it requires on-demand testing. Most of these tests are conducted in in-patient laboratories and demand tends to be insulated from economic downturns. In addition, we believe the on-site laboratory contributes meaningfully to many of our hospital customers’ earnings and that our core market is relatively insulated from outsourcing to reference laboratories. We believe this combination of product and end market diversification allowed us to generally outperform the market on a core revenue growth basis during the COVID-19 pandemic and we believe this resiliency will continue into the future.
 Superior customer experience and brand loyalty resulting in high customer retention and win rates
 We deliver industry-leading test performance in a way that is easy for laboratory directors and technical staff to manage their operations on a daily basis, which leads to excellent customer appeal and loyalty. In 2015, we launched ORTHOCARE with the goal of providing best-in-class service and support program for hospitals, hospital networks, blood banks and laboratories. Our ORTHOCARE service program is a critical element of the superior customer experience that we deliver to our customers. Since forming ORTHOCARE, we

were the highest recommended manufacturer for the last six consecutive years (2016 through 2021) in a survey of clinical laboratory professionals in U.S. hospitals conducted by ServiceTrak. In the same survey in 2021, we were ranked #1 in seven out of eight categories relating to its manufacturing, system and service performance.
 In our Focus Markets, the simplicity and reliability of our instruments and tests often reduces the need for staff hands-on time, producing a lower total cost of ownership for our customers. We believe that after instrument cost, the quality of service is the largest driver of customer choice when selecting a Clinical Laboratories vendor. Our superior service and customer performance contribute to our revenue retention rate of approximately 98% in 2021 and our average Clinical Laboratories and Transfusion Medicine customer relationships of almost 13 years and 15 years, respectively.
 In Clinical Laboratories, beyond the simplicity of dry chemistry slides, we offer instrument e-connectivity, customizable automation tracks, a suite of upgraded quality control reagents and market-leading calibration stability, producing higher efficiency and lower total cost of ownership. In Transfusion Medicine, our ORTHO VISION platform has expanded our leadership position because it automated and simplified the test workflow for time-strained blood bank staff, increasing throughput and efficiency.
 Highly compelling solutions supported by its leading and innovative research and development capabilities
 We have a rich history of innovation spanning over eight decades and now have a portfolio of 17 instruments and over 245 assays across Clinical Laboratories and Transfusion Medicine. Our unique dry slide technology for clinical chemistry delivers accurate results, stability and reliability in challenging laboratory environments, an environmentally friendly profile and superior ease-of-use. Our XT Slides provide the ability to perform two tests on one slide, resulting in 40% greater VITROS throughput with 96% first-pass yield. Combined with our robust instrument design and development capabilities, we engineer laboratory testing solutions for our customers that offer industry leading cost effectiveness for medium- and high-throughput testing applications, particularly where space is constrained. We have partnered with Quotient to commercialize, when approved, the next generation product in IH that enables a high level of multiplexing and addresses the ultra-high throughput market. Since our separation from Johnson & Johnson, we have engineered and delivered to market six new instrument platforms, and expanded our assay offering with over 120 new or improved assays, which has increased our product vitality, market share and revenue growth.
 Extensive and balanced global commercial footprint with reinvigorated focus on growth
 We sell our products and services in more than 130 countries worldwide and have a direct presence in 36 countries. We support these commercial operations with approximately 2,300 commercial sales, service and regional marketing teammates and a network of more than 300 distributors globally. We also have an extensive global network of manufacturing and distribution centers that allows us to be closer and more responsive to our customers while managing and optimizing its cost structure. Our global footprint allows us to effectively launch our new product innovations, including instrument platform developments and new assays, across the globe. Our geographic balance also provides revenue diversification, which helps us to hedge against currency fluctuations and potential regional economic downturns.
 We believe that opportunities in emerging markets represent a strong area of growth and profitability for our business. We are using targeted commercial activities to expand in these attractive end markets. In addition, we are developing lower cost instruments and market-specific assays to compete directly with low cost local players in certain regions.
 Disciplined approach to streamline operations and optimize our cost structure
 We have taken a rigorous approach to continuously improving our operational and administrative resources and cost structure. We have an efficient network of manufacturing, distribution and support centers to support worldwide product availability, with assay manufacturing in the United States and Wales, partner instrument manufacturing in Switzerland and Mexico, product distribution centers in multiple locations across the globe, shared service centers in the United States and Prague and certain operations in India. This not only brings us closer to our customers, but consolidates manufacturing and several other support functions to lower-cost geographies. We have seen margin expansion over the last two years and hope to continue capitalizing on operational efficiencies going forward.
 Deeply committed leadership team with broad experience in healthcare and diagnostics
 Our dedicated and highly respected Global Leadership Team (“GLT”) is comprised of 16 members with significant experience in the IVD and healthcare industries. For instance, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Innovation Officer, General Counsel, and Executive Vice President of Commercial Excellence and Strategy each have more than 25 years of experience in their respective fields of expertise and together have more than 125 years of experience with IVD or commercial healthcare companies. These individuals are supported by their GLT colleagues with extensive industry knowledge and long-term experience leading at Ortho or other multinational companies in the IVD industry. Under their leadership we have transformed our mindset from standing up the business to executing on our growth strategies by increasing our customer focus and our emphasis on innovation and operational

efficiency. We believe that the industry knowledge and dedication of our GLT members, combined with their long-term experience profitably growing multinational companies, are instrumental for the successful execution of our growth strategy going forward.
 Our growth strategy
 Our heritage and strength lie in our long-term customer relationships and trusted brand, which create a steady base of recurring revenue and a foundation for future growth. By focusing on LCV, we identify ways in which we can utilize product innovation and impactful customer service and solutions to deepen these partnerships and add value over time. We plan to grow our business by broadening our existing relationships, winning new customers and targeting high-growth end markets and adjacencies. We are focused on sustainable long-term growth through commercial excellence that maximizes LCV, strengthens existing relationships through superior service and delivers innovative products for our customers and their patients. The key elements of our strategy to accelerate and sustain revenue growth and operating leverage include:
 Focusing relentlessly on maximizing LCV, which is designed to produce and maintain a growing and recurring, high margin, durable financial profile and contributes to growth
 Over our more than 80 years supporting the IVD testing needs of our customers, we have developed deep and enduring relationships with our customers. We seek to expand our relationship with both new and existing customers by offering them higher throughput integrated instrumentation, automation, and an expanding assay menu that grows with them as their needs evolve. On average globally, when one of our Clinical Laboratories customers upgrades from a standalone instrument to an integrated instrument, we typically see an increase in annual consumable revenues of approximately 65%. After this initial increase in utilization, we typically see that customer’s recurring revenues increase by approximately 3% to 7% on an annual basis. In our experience, by the time a customer is running sufficient volumes of tests to consider automation, annual reagent purchases have roughly doubled, and upgrading to an automated instrument increases this average by an additional 27%. This combined effect leads to an average increase of approximately 300% in annual revenues as a customer upgrades from an initial integrated placement to automation installation. In Transfusion Medicine, the pattern is even more striking. When customers move from manual testing to a semi-automated solution, the customers typically experience an approximately 70% increase in workflow efficiency, and we see an average 600% increase in revenues. When they graduate to our fully automated ORTHO VISION instruments, these customers typically experience a 90% improvement in workflow efficiency and we see an additional increase of approximately 90% on average in recurring revenue.
 Providing an unparalleled customer experience to retain and attract our existing and new customers
 We continue to invest in both technology and business model innovation to expand our service advantages. For instance, improvements in instrument and assay reliability have reduced our service intervention rate by more than 30% since mid-2014. In addition to our core product innovations that continuously improve instrument reliability and ease-of-use—for instance, e-connectivity, improved controls, e-calibration and laboratory informatics—we are implementing exciting technology applications to support our award-winning service team. From smart mobile applications that enable service alerts and remote monitoring to merged reality on mobile devices, including smart glasses that support field engineers and customers in service calls, we continue to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our service offerings. Over time, we will also seek to increase our ability to monetize our service differentiation beyond simply enhancing customer retention and contract wins.
 Leveraging our global footprint to deliver innovative solutions to meet our customers’ needs in both developed and emerging markets
 Our global commercial organization is comprised of approximately 2,300 commercial sales, service and regional marketing teammates. From 2018 through 2019, we invested in expanding and improving our commercial capabilities in our two most critical markets—North America and China—adding sales and regional marketing personnel, strengthening our distributor networks, increasing sales analytics and targeting support though our customer relationship management system. We focused our commercial teams more squarely on our Focus Markets, which increased our win rate and allowed our team to allocate resources and focus on relationship management, menu utilization and new assay adoption, helping drive our recent revenue growth in these markets. Since the execution of our U.S. commercial excellence program, we have enjoyed 12 consecutive quarters of North America core recurring revenue growth and, up until the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced similar results following implementation of our China program. We are also focused on high growth emerging markets including China, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America. We are targeting increased investment in market-appropriate products and local capabilities in order to gain market share in these emerging markets and enhance our overall growth profile. For instance, we are planning the development of lower cost instruments and assays that are suitable for these emerging markets. In some countries, the government is playing a significant role in expanding population access to healthcare and diagnostic testing, particularly in more rural populations. The Chinese government, for instance, has dramatically increased the portion of the population with access to healthcare services and is actively pushing diagnostic volumes to tiers of smaller hospitals at the regional and provincial level, hospitals that fit well into our Focus Markets.


Creating meaningful product innovation through menu expansion, development of novel instruments and enhancement of automation and informatics
 Since our separation from Johnson & Johnson, we have focused significant investment on improving and expanding our test menu, with the introduction of over 120 new or improved tests, which we believe has contributed meaningfully to our accelerating growth. We continue to focus on developing significant new assays that are critical to our Focus Market customers while continuing to build our strength and differentiation in acute and critical care assays. In particular, recent launches in cardiac (hs Troponin, NT-proBNP II), infectious disease (HIV Combo, HTLV, T. Cruzi, COVID-19 antigen and multiple COVID-19 antibody tests), and sepsis (PCT, IL-6) are generating new growth.
 We will continue to invest in the next generation of instruments for Clinical Laboratories and Transfusion Medicine. Given the longer cycle of innovation, it is important that we remain focused on the next platforms to drive customer acquisition and retention. In addition, our team is looking into novel technologies that we can leverage across Clinical Laboratories and Transfusion Medicine. We are also evaluating using our dry technology to increase multiplexing beyond dual slides and extending into dry immunoassay by leveraging patented microfluidics approaches. A completely dry integrated platform would likely reduce our instrument footprint, increase test throughput and reduce user complexity with excellent test reliability and performance.
 We continue to build on advantages in ease-of-use and test workflow in the laboratory, with a primary focus on the needs of our target customer. We are co-developing improved automation track components and a new quality control menu with one of our partners. ORTHO CONNECT continues to evolve and develop across CL and TM as next generation middleware that enables the customer to track and control data and key performance metrics across their laboratories. Beyond this new platform, we plan to explore and seek to develop new digital solutions, such as laboratory informatics dashboards, to improve customer performance and workflow.
 To support menu expansion and development of novel instruments, we are pursuing “Follow the Sun” research and development and manufacturing capabilities and partnerships in targeted locations across the globe that we believe will increase our local market access, tailor products for local market needs, reduce the time and cost required for product launches and accelerate our cadence of assay and instrument launches over time. As an example, we have built up research and development capabilities at our Pencoed, Wales site, which has a lower cost basis and ensures proximity to manufacturing for sustaining engineering of products.
 Continuing to identify operating efficiencies to allow for reinvestment in growth and improve margins
 Our leadership team has taken a disciplined, continuous improvement approach to streamlining our operational resources and cost structure. Executing on our value capture program over the last several years, our team has identified areas to improve margins and cash flows through consolidation of manufacturing to lower-cost geographies, annual Six Sigma projects in areas such as procurement, and information technology improvements. We opened a shared service center in Prague and have shifted several support functions abroad to manage costs. We continue to reinvest a significant portion of these savings in commercial and research and development projects to spur further growth. We expect to leverage our fixed cost base and the expansion of our diversified product portfolio to drive incremental margin improvement.
 Pursuing business development opportunities, partnerships and strategic acquisitions to enter adjacencies or expand our current business units
 We have a successful track record of partnering with a range of companies to accelerate research and development, add incremental competencies and/or co-develop products. We believe that our partnerships with Thermo Fisher, IDEXX and Quotient will help expand our capabilities in laboratory automation, veterinary and ultra-high throughput Immunohematology applications, respectively. In addition to these types of opportunities, we plan to explore adjacencies in both Clinical Laboratories and Transfusion Medicine that will leverage our global footprint, hospital and donor center call points and/or technology advantages.
 Our management team is focused on mergers and acquisitions, partnerships and business development opportunities that we believe will ultimately enhance LCV and drive incremental top-line growth and profitability. We intend to pursue strategic opportunities that will accelerate our expansion or entry into attractive end-markets and geographies. We plan to maintain a disciplined approach to mergers and acquisitions and are constantly evaluating a wide range of opportunities that are natural adjacencies with the hospital and other call points in our Focus Markets.
 Our industry
IVD involves testing of human tissue or fluid samples outside of the body to screen and detect diseases, infections and medical conditions. IVD testing is a core component of routine healthcare check-ups for those who are presenting with symptoms or require procedures. It influences up to 70% of critical healthcare clinical decision-making and can occur in a range of clinical settings from large reference laboratories and hospitals, to physician offices and retail clinics.

The global IVD market represented approximately $76 billion in global revenue in 2020. IVD is divided among multiple testing disciplines, including Immunoassay, Clinical Chemistry, Molecular Diagnostics, Anatomical Pathology, Microbiology, Hematology and Coagulation, among others. We compete in the two largest testing disciplines (excluding the impact of COVID-19), Immunoassay and Clinical Chemistry, which together comprise Clinical Laboratories, and represented approximately $24 billion of our current addressable market in 2020. We are also the global leader in Transfusion Medicine, which includes hospital-based Immunohematology and Donor Screening for blood and plasma at hospitals and other donation centers, and represents approximately $2 billion of our current addressable market. Today, we sell diagnostic instruments and reagents in a global market worth approximately $26 billion that is projected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% from 2020 to 2024.
 Of the approximately $26 billion market, approximately 62% resides in the more developed regions of North America, Europe and Japan, which are projected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1% to 2% from 2020 to 2024. Approximately 38% of the market is concentrated in the faster-growing regions of China, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America, which are projected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 8% to 11% from 2020 to 2024. With approximately 31% of our core revenue coming from emerging markets, we have a strong position in these growing markets. Embedded in our strategy of developing new integrated analyzers and bringing them to market is the parallel refurbishment of used analyzers and resale of these systems, primarily in emerging markets. We are focusing increased investment in market-appropriate products and local capabilities in order to gain market share in emerging markets and enhance our overall growth.
 We believe there are six key trends affecting our end markets that will drive increasing demand for our products and solutions and offer new opportunities for business expansion:
•Aging population and increased need for testing of chronic conditions. Populations continue to age, particularly in the developed economies, which is driving increased prevalence of both chronic conditions and the acute diseases of later life, such as cancer, cardiac disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. This demographic trend is leading to an increase in surgical volumes and supports growing demand for diagnostic testing and pre-surgical screening on both an acute and routine health screening basis, and accounts for a significant portion of ongoing test menu expansion.
 •Expansion of healthcare, particularly in emerging markets. Continuing economic growth in emerging markets is increasing the size of the middle class and available disposable income, expanding resources available for healthcare. With most health decisions informed by diagnostic testing, economic development is driving instrument purchases and higher test volumes. 
 •Consolidation and automation. Hospitals and laboratories continue to merge into larger healthcare systems. This trend, combined with a shortage of skilled laboratory technicians, has driven consolidation of testing volumes into medium- to high-volume centralized laboratories with fully automated instruments. These automated instruments offer higher test throughput versus standalone specialty instruments. To enhance productivity, these platforms are also often connected by software and automation tracks to enable more seamless routing and testing of patient samples. 
 •Digital solutions and informatics. Diagnostic tests generate information that aids in clinical practice or the study of health and disease. This data, combined with the advancement of internet applications and software, offer new ways to create value for hospital and laboratory customers. Tying test data into laboratory information and electronic medical record systems is only the starting point. Digital solutions can also help laboratories manage test utilization, efficiency and inventory, aid in clinical decision support and pool test data for research purposes. 
 •New diagnostic technologies and continued decentralization. Diagnostics continue to advance with new technologies changing and improving test accuracy and operational performance. New modalities have emerged with the advent of molecular and genetic diagnostics, the expansion of proteomics supporting improved and broader immunoassay testing, and technologies like miniaturization, sensors, and microfluidics enabling point-of-care testing. Diagnostic testing at emergency room and intensive care unit bedsides in the hospital, physician offices, urgent care centers, pharmacy minute clinics and at the patient’s home is increasing. These technologies are creating new opportunities within IVD and growth for the broader IVD market overall. As the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored, point-of-care tests typically have lower test accuracy than those performed on central lab instruments, are often more expensive on a per test basis and can struggle with throughput for mass screening. 
 •Emergence and identification of new diseases and treatments to include plasma based therapies. The COVID-19 pandemic is the most salient example of the continuing emergence of new infectious diseases on a global scale which highlights the importance of accurate and efficient diagnostic testing. We have witnessed the emergence of HIV, Ebola, Zika, SARS and MERS, and it is estimated that one new infectious disease is emerging every year. New diagnostic tests and test volumes are driven both by the emergence of new diseases and by the discovery of new or improved markers for disease. Beyond infectious diseases, significant assay innovation is occurring in a range of therapy areas, including oncology, neurology and cardiovascular disease. 


Our products, pipeline and services
Throughout eight decades of innovation, we have been a leader in the diagnostics field and brought multiple innovations to market such as testing for RH phenotyping, HCV, Chagas’ Disease, and most recently COVID-19. Since our separation from Johnson & Johnson, we have engineered and delivered six new instrument platforms to market and expanded our assay offering with over 120 new or improved assays, which has increased our product vitality and revenue growth.
 Our revenue is driven by a “razor-razor blade” business model. Through this model, we generally sell or place instruments under long-term contracts, which support the ongoing sale of our assays, reagents and consumables. Our instruments are closed systems, requiring customers to purchase the assays, reagents and consumables from us. These sales generate a high proportion of recurring revenues. As of January 2, 2022, we had an installed base of approximately 21,000 instruments, which increased approximately 3% since January 3, 2021.
 Clinical Laboratories
We have been a pioneer of important technological advances in clinical diagnostics, including our unique dry slide technology which offers customers superior test performance with clear ease-of-use advantages and lower total cost of ownership. Dry slide technology combines the spreading, masking, scavenger and reagent layers into one postage-stamp-sized slide that provides clinicians with high-quality results quickly, efficiently and economically. Our slides are very stable. The current approximate six-month span between calibrations for slides is industry-leading and we expect this to be significantly improved through ongoing research and development. We carry a comprehensive clinical chemistry test menu, and dry slides have long shelf life with lower laboratory shelf space required. Our new XT7600 and XT3400 instruments extend these advantages with digital accuracy and XT multi-test slides, and we have a pipeline opportunity to increase multi-test capacity further over time. Our dry slide chemistry is well positioned for rising environmental concerns given its eco-friendly profile with no water usage and significantly reduced clinical waste and biohazard.
 Our flagship Clinical Laboratories platform is the VITROS family of instruments, which includes a series of clinical chemistry, immunoassay and integrated (combined chemistry and immunoassay) systems and automation and middleware solutions. The VITROS instruments run a wide range of assays, from infectious diseases, sepsis, cardiovascular conditions and anemia, to bone disease, diabetes, drugs of abuse/toxicology, oncology and renal disease. We have six VITROS instrument analyzers that provide standardized performance and are still sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of our customers across the spectrum of laboratory sizes and volumes. Our VITROS instruments are placed in centralized, higher-throughput testing sites (hospitals and laboratories) and decentralized, lower-throughput sites (physician offices, clinics and specialty settings).
 

We launched the next generation of VITROS instruments—the XT 7600 integrated system and XT 3400 clinical chemistry analyzer—in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Both instruments deploy a highly accurate, digital reflectometer that measures test results and takes advantage of new XT chemistry slides, combining two tests that are frequently used together, and improving the economics for us and our customers. Additionally, we believe that digital sensing will enable improved test accuracy through better image processing over time. We believe the XT instruments offer several important advancements over prior generations:
•40% greater test throughput when using our XT-slides


•96% first-pass yield on test results 
 •Designed to offer high reliability with a 98% up-time guarantee for U.S. customers 
 Our Clinical Laboratories assay menu is quite broad, covering 24 different therapeutic areas and approximately 90% of a typical laboratory’s testing needs. We are particularly known for the strength of our dry clinical chemistry tests, as well as infectious disease and acute care immunoassays, including our high-performing cardiac markers for heart attack and congestive heart failure. In Greater China, for example, we believe we are the clinical chemistry market leader in separate “STAT” testing laboratories that seek rapid, high-performing assays to drive rapid clinical decisions.

 Transfusion Medicine
Immunohematology
In Immunohematology, we are the global market leader based on the strength of our instruments and assays. Our flagship IH analyzers are the ORTHO VISION and ORTHO VISION Max systems that automate blood typing and serology disease screening for blood banks. ORTHO VISION was originally launched in 2015, followed by the ORTHO VISION Max and the Next Gen ORTHO VISION Swift, which is designed to be faster, quieter and even more cyber-secure than previous generations of our products. ORTHO VISION has been extremely successful in driving workflow simplification and automation for the customer. In addition, we sell the semi-automated Ortho Workstation for blood bank customers that have lower volumes or need for test automation.
 
In fiscal 2021, we launched our enhanced ORTHO VISION Swift and ORTHO VISION Max Swift Analyzers systems that automate blood typing and serology disease screening for blood banks. Additionally, in fiscal 2021, we launched the ORTHO OPTIX reader in North America. OPTIX is targeted at blood banks who desire greater precision reading their manual test results and is designed to provide improved software and integration with laboratory information systems, improved workflow and 99.9% concordance with ORTHO VISION test results. OPTIX provides an entry point for customers that want to move from manual to semi-automated testing.
 We also have a partnership with Quotient for the Immunohematology application of the MosaiQTM analyzer, which is designed to employ a cutting-edge microarray technology to allow advanced multiplexing. MosaiQ multiplexing is expected to enable multiple tests to be run simultaneously on a single, low-volume patient sample and drive significantly higher test throughput, which would strengthen our position in the ultra-high throughput segment of the IH market. It also offers the potential for streamlined inventory management and concordant results across donor screening and pre-transfusion testing and matching.
 Our Immunohematology instruments operate with two different modalities of test consumables. In the U.S., our automated systems use patented ID-Micro Typing System (“IS-MTS”) gel cards and outside the U.S., we sell BIOVUE cassettes that utilize column agglutination technology (“CAT”). Both approaches are designed to provide reliable test results and simplify test workflow. With the 2016 launch of ORTHO SERA reagents, we offer a comprehensive test Immunohematology menu that we believe covers more than 99% of most tested blood antigens and all the diseases regularly required for transfusion screening globally.
 Donor Screening
Our Donor Screening business is focused on instruments and tests used for blood and plasma screening for infectious diseases for customers, which include some of the largest donor testing institutions, primarily in the U.S. In Donor Screening, our core instrument offering is the ORTHO VERSEIA Integrated Processor (“VIP”)—an automated pipetting and processing system that brings together the ORTHO VERSEIA pipettor and ORTHO Summit Processor to enable end-to-end pipetting and processing. For Donor Screening, our serology test menu covers the full range of blood types and a comprehensive set of infectious disease screens, including important tests for tropical diseases like Chagas’ that are critical for care in emerging markets.

 Sales, marketing and distribution
 We use state-of-the-art manufacturing and distribution capabilities to produce and deliver diagnostic instruments and assays for hospitals, laboratories and blood and plasma centers worldwide. Our primary distribution center locations are centrally located in the U.S. and Europe and have extended hours and efficient transportation processes.
 Our sales team is comprised of highly skilled and experienced professionals. In the U.S., we use a generalized sales force for Immunohematology and Clinical Laboratories and a separate specialist sales force for Donor Screening. Across this global footprint, we operate a region-specific sales model. Our developed markets, specifically in North America and Western Europe, are served primarily through direct sales; however, we generally utilize third-party distributors in emerging markets, such as China, the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe as this model is more commercially effective.
Our global team strives to deliver a differentiated level of customer service and support by surrounding our customers with devoted and experienced professionals. Our network of field engineers is responsible for installing our instruments and providing customer support. In addition, our call center team and laboratory specialists are available to provide customer training and ongoing customer support.
 Research and development
 Our research and development focus is on designing and developing products while balancing our research and development team’s capacity, development timelines and overall cost. We have been a pioneer of important technological advances in diagnostics, including our unique dry slide technology and our automated and semi-automated blood banking systems. Our research and development team is comprised of a balanced mix of experienced professionals with years of experience in the diagnostics industry and recently trained technologists, and together have the know-how and technical capabilities in information technology, biomedical science and engineering required to continue to innovate. Key strengths include new assay format development, new instrument systems development and the complex integration of the two. In addition, in order to create new opportunities, manage costs and adapt to a rapidly changing industry, we also enter into strategic partnerships as part of our research and development process.
Our solutions are central to the operations of hospitals, clinics, blood banks and donor centers around the world, where they are used to help diagnose certain conditions, such as cancer or heart attacks, and infectious diseases, such as hepatitis, HIV, and most recently, COVID-19, where we have launched four antibody tests and an antigen test. Our primary research and development facility is located in Rochester, New York, with certain functions conducted out of Raritan, New Jersey and Pencoed, Wales.
 Suppliers and raw materials
 We obtain raw materials from reputable outside suppliers and believe our business relationships with them are good. Some of our products are derived from source biologic materials, which are available from a limited number of sources. To date, we have been able to obtain sufficient quantities of required materials for use in manufacturing our products, but there can be no assurance that a sufficient supply of required materials will always be available to us. We employ a number of strategies to mitigate raw material supply risk, including managing safety stock inventories as well as developing second sources for key raw materials.
 In addition, we have recently encountered some increasing pressures on raw material pricing. We employ a number of strategies to mitigate raw material price increases, including identifying alternative sources for raw materials and implementing operational efficiencies.
 We source certain instruments from industry specific suppliers. We believe that our business relationships with our instrument suppliers are good. Each instrument supplier is placed under a contract that provides terms and conditions designed to preserve business continuity. In the event either party terminates the agreement, the “out clauses” provide sufficient time to effect a transition to a new supplier and maintain supply continuity. This transition would also be characterized by the build of a strategic inventory to bridge any time period required to initiate supply from an alternate provider.


We have experienced and continue to manage through supply chain challenges relating to key components of our instruments. For instance, we have experienced supply chain shortages of certain key components of our instruments and assays, which are impacting our ability to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis and have had, and are expected to continue to have, a negative impact on our business and results of operations, which could be material. We are continuing to work closely with our primary suppliers of these components, alongside their downstream supply chain, in order to maintain supply to our customers. In addition, we are employing a number of strategies to mitigate supply chain shortages, including pursuing additional suppliers for certain of these key components. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business, operations and growth strategies—We have significant international sales and operations and face risks related to health epidemics, including the ongoing global pandemic related to COVID-19. Our business, consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been and may continue to be negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic” and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks related to our employees, customers and suppliers—We rely on certain suppliers and manufacturers for raw materials and components for our products and services, and fluctuations in the availability and price of such materials, products and services may interfere with our ability to meet our customers’ needs.”
 Manufacturing
 Our manufacturing operation benefits from our broad global footprint, scale and workforce capabilities. We believe our plant capacity and available space is sufficient to accommodate growth, maintain quality and ensure continuity. We use state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities to produce the instruments and assays that we sell. Our manufacturing function has extensive process excellence and high operating standards, which provide us with the capabilities to offset inflation and control costs. Our primary manufacturing facilities are located in Raritan, New Jersey, Rochester, New York and Pencoed, Wales. Each facility is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) or other international public health and regulatory agencies.
 Competition
The IVD market is fragmented and highly competitive in both Clinical Laboratories and Transfusion Medicine. There are several global companies with whom we compete, as well as regional and local companies focused on particular markets and/or technologies. In the Clinical Laboratories market, our principal competitors include: Abbott Laboratories, Danaher Corporation, Roche, and Siemens Healthineers. In the Transfusion Medicine market, our principal competitors include: Abbott Laboratories, Diasorin, Roche in Donor Screening, and Bio-Rad and Immucor in Immunohematology.

 Intellectual property
In the course of our business, we have developed and will continue to develop proprietary products, technologies, software systems, processes and other intellectual property (“IP”). We protect our IP through filing of patents, trademarks and domain names, as may be deemed applicable and appropriate, with appropriate regional coverage. For example, we have applied for and/or obtained and maintain registrations in the U.S. and other countries numerous trademarks, including ORTHO CLINICAL DIAGNOSTICS, ORTHO, VITROS and ORTHO VISION. We also seek to protect our proprietary and confidential information and trade secrets through confidentiality agreements with employees, customers, vendors and other third parties, as well as administrative and technical safeguards.
 We also enter into agreements with third parties for the license and use of their intellectual property, although no one such license is material to the business as a whole.

IP is an essential part of our business, and IP assets are, as a whole, material to the performance of our business. No single IP asset, however, whether owned or licensed, is material to our business as a whole.
 As of January 2, 2022, we owned approximately 665 patents and 1,125 trademarks, and we had approximately 44 trademark applications and more than 80 patent applications pending. The majority of our patents and patent applications are in our Clinical Laboratories line of business.
As of January 2, 2022, we were not subject to any material claim or legal action alleging infringement of third-party owned IP.
 Collaboration arrangements
 We have various collaboration arrangements, which provide us with the rights to develop, produce and market products using certain know-how, technology and patent rights maintained by our collaborative partners. These arrangements are often entered into in order to share risks and rewards related to a specific program or product. Our collaborative arrangements include a number of ongoing relationships for test development, instrument development and automation track design and distribution.
Our Joint Business is a collaboration with Grifols relating to our Hepatitis and HIV diagnostics business. The arrangement is governed by an agreement originally entered into in 1989 with a 50-year term, which, among other things, provides for a profit sharing arrangement whereby the profits we generate from our production and sale of Hepatitis and HIV diagnostics products are shared with Grifols, and the profits generated by Grifols from its sale of certain antigens and licensing of certain intellectual property rights are shared with us. The agreement also gives us the right to use such intellectual property. The majority of the patents underlying these intellectual property rights have expired. Grifols also supplies us with a portion of the antigens used in our production of these diagnostics products.
 Human capital resources
 As of January 2, 2022, we had approximately 4,800 employees. Approximately 51% of our employees are located outside of the U.S., primarily in Europe and Asia. We employ approximately 1,025 manufacturing employees and approximately 2,300 employees in commercial sales, service and regional marketing positions worldwide including approximately 980 service teammates. Our highly trained service professionals include over 360 laboratory specialists with advanced qualifications. For example, approximately 95% of our U.S. laboratory specialists have medical technician degrees, and customer excellence training has been prepared for all teammates. We support unions, works councils and/or collective bargaining agreements in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the U.K., with approximately 20% of our associates globally participating in a union, collective bargaining agreement or works council. We believe that our relations with our employees are generally good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our teammates into our highly collaborative culture. We believe our success depends on our ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate diverse highly skilled personnel. In particular, we depend upon the personal efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management to partner effectively as a team, and who provide strategic direction, develop our business, manage our operations and maintain a cohesive and stable work environment. We also rely on qualified managers and skilled employees, such as scientists, engineers and laboratory technicians, with technical expertise in operations, scientific knowledge, engineering and quality management experience in order to operate our business successfully.
Our compensation program is designed to retain, motivate and as needed, attract highly qualified executives and talented teammates. Accordingly, we use a mix of competitive base salary, cash-based annual incentive compensation, performance-based equity compensation awards and other employee benefits.
We are committed to fostering a culture that supports diversity and an environment of mutual respect, equity and collaboration that helps drive our business. Ortho embraces diversity, equity and inclusion and celebrates the successes we achieve as “One Ortho.” As a global organization, our unique perspectives, diverse background and collective strengths drive creative solutions, breakthrough innovation and highly productive teams. Early in fiscal 2021, we established the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council with a mission to foster a collaborative and innovative organization, ensuring all teammates lead with an inclusive mindset and feel confident that their voices are being heard. We plan to expand upon Ortho’s foundation of diversity and inclusion and deliver a unique and globally aware Ortho identity that accelerates our growth internally and externally.
 Health, safety and environmental
 Our operations and facilities are subject to various laws and regulations domestically and around the world governing the protection of the environment and health and safety, including the discharge and emissions of pollutants to air and water and the handling, management and disposal of hazardous substances.

We are committed to employee health and safety in the workplace and we have an excellent safety record. In the U.S., our manufacturing facilities hold various certifications depending on the site. Our Raritan, New Jersey and Rochester, New York sites have both received the gold award for American Heart Association Workplace Solutions for the fourth year in a row. The Raritan and Rochester sites are also certified as part of the OSHA Voluntary Protection Programs. Our facility in Pencoed, Wales has received recognition by the Welsh government for facility safety and environmental performance.
We believe that all of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are operated in compliance with existing environmental requirements in all material respects, including the operating permits required thereunder. Although we do not currently expect the costs of compliance with existing environmental requirements to have a material impact on our financial position, we may incur additional costs or obligations to comply with environmental and health and safety requirements as a result of changes in law or customer demands, including those relating to our products. In addition, many of our manufacturing sites have a long history of industrial operations, and remediation is or may be required at a number of these locations. Although we do not currently expect outstanding remediation obligations to have a material impact on our financial position, the ultimate cost of remediation is subject to a number of variables and is difficult to accurately predict. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks related to government regulation—We could incur costs complying with environmental and health and safety requirements, or as a result of liability for contamination or other potential environmental harm or liability caused by our operations.”
 Government regulation
 Our products and operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the U.S., as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. In the U.S., our products are regulated as either medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations, or as biological products under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and their implementing regulations, each as amended and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices and biological products to ensure that such products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the applicable requirements of the FDCA and PHSA.
U.S. regulation of medical devices
The majority of our diagnostic products and analyzers are regulated by the FDA as medical devices in the U.S. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the U.S. requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, or approval of a PMA application. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) for medical devices known as the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III.
While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Class III devices require approval of a PMA application evidencing safety and effectiveness of the device. We currently market the majority of our diagnostic products in the U.S. pursuant to 510(k) clearances and PMA approvals.
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating to the FDA’s satisfaction that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to another legally marketed device that itself does not require PMA approval (a predicate device). A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months, but often takes longer. FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, the FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees for medical device establishments.

If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a lawfully marketed predicate device, it will grant 510(k) clearance to authorize the device for commercialization. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent,” the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo classification process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k), de novo classification request or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination not to seek a new 510(k) or other form of marketing authorization for the modification to the 510(k)-cleared product, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained or a de novo classification is granted.
The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”) regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements.
In addition to clinical and preclinical data, the PMA must contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR.
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval. Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement, or in some cases a new PMA.
In addition to the 510(k) clearance, PMA, and de novo classification pathways to market, the Commissioner of the FDA, under delegated authority from the Secretary of HHS may, under certain circumstances in connection with a declared public health emergency, allow for the marketing of a product that does not otherwise comply with FDA regulations by issuing an EUA for such product. Before an EUA may be issued by HHS, the Secretary must declare an emergency based on a determination that a public health emergency exists that effects or has the significant potential to affect, national security, and that involves a specified biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent or agents, or a specified disease or condition that may be attributable to such agent or agents. On February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary determined that the novel coronavirus presented a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect

national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad and declared that circumstances existed justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
In order to be the subject of an EUA, the FDA Commissioner must conclude that, based on the totality of scientific evidence available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing a disease attributable to the agents described above, that the product’s potential benefits outweigh its potential risks and that there is no adequate, approved alternative to the product. Products subject to an EUA must still comply with the conditions of the EUA, including labeling and marketing requirements. Moreover, the authorization to market products under an EUA is limited to the period of time the public health emergency declaration is in effect. In the U.S., we market our VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibody test and calibrators and controls and VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody test and calibrators and controls pursuant to EUAs originally granted by the FDA in April 2020, and we market our VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test pursuant to an EUA originally granted by the FDA on January 11, 2021.
 After a device is cleared or approved or otherwise authorized for marketing, numerous pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply unless explicitly exempt. These include:

 U.S. regulation of biological products
Certain of our blood screening products are regulated by the FDA as biological products, also called biologics. In the U.S., biologics are subject to regulation under the FDCA, PHSA, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologics may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice requirements; 
 •submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an IRB or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose; 
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 


•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the U.S. 
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial of a biologic product candidate in the U.S., we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced and of select clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 Any biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
FDA enforcement
The FDA may withdraw marketing authorization if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, product recalls, fines, warning letters, untitled letters, clinical holds on clinical studies, refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, product seizures or detention, refusal to permit the import or export of products, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs, the issuance of corrective information, injunctions, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
In addition, the FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics and medical devices. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are cleared or approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the authorized label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
U.S. healthcare laws
The costs of healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused on programs that encourage doctors to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the marketplace and increased attention is being paid to medical device pricing, appropriate medical device utilization and the quality and costs of healthcare generally.
The implementation of the PPACA, in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The PPACA, among other things, provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the PPACA expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and political challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the PPACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the PPACA.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to providers by 2% per fiscal year, effective on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. MACRA, enacted on April 16, 2015, repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations. It is unclear what effect new quality and payment programs, such as MACRA, may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 On January 1, 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) implemented certain provisions of PAMA, which made substantial changes to the way in which clinical laboratory services are paid under Medicare. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenue from payments made under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule or the Physician Fee Schedule are required to report to CMS, beginning in 2017 and every three years thereafter (or annually for “advanced diagnostics laboratory tests”), private payer payment rates and volumes for their tests. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties. CMS uses the data to calculate a weighted median payment rate for each test, which is used to establish a revised Medicare reimbursement rate. Under PAMA, the revised Medicare reimbursement rates were scheduled to apply to clinical diagnostic laboratory tests furnished on or after January 1, 2018. The revised reimbursement methodology is expected to generally result in relatively lower reimbursement under Medicare for clinical diagnostic lab tests than has been historically available. Any reduction to payment rates resulting from the new methodology is limited to 10% per test per year in 2018 through 2020, and to 15% per test per year in 2021 through 2023. For clinical diagnostic laboratory tests that are assigned a new or substantially revised Healthcare Common Proceduring Coding System code, initial payment rates for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests that are not advanced diagnostic laboratory tests will be assigned by the cross-walk or gap-fill methodology. Initial payment rates for new advanced diagnostic laboratory tests will be based on the actual list charge for the laboratory test. The CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, amended the timeline for reporting private payer payment rates and delayed by one year the payment reductions scheduled for 2021. On December 10, 2021, Congress passed the PMAFSA, which delays the next data reporting period by an additional year and prevents any reduction in payment amounts from commercial payer rate implementation in 2022.


In addition to the CARES Act, Congress has enacted other laws in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to provide financial relief to healthcare providers and suppliers, including diagnostic laboratories, and encourage implementation of diagnostic testing and treatment for COVID-19. For instance, the FFCRA, enacted on March 18, 2020, requires certain governmental and commercial insurance plans to provide coverage of COVID-19 diagnostic testing services without imposing cost-sharing (e.g., copays, deductibles or coinsurance) or other utilization management requirements. The CARES Act and the PPPHCEA, enacted on April 24, 2020, each appropriated approximately $100 billion to provide financial relief for certain healthcare providers and to expand treatment and diagnostic testing capacity for COVID-19. The CAA, which was enacted on December 27, 2020 and included further pandemic relief measures, temporarily increased payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule by 3.75% beginning January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. The PMAFSA further established a temporary 3% payment rate increase under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule that will remain in effect beginning January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. The CARES Act, as subsequently amended by the CAA and PMAFSA, also suspended, for the period from May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022, the 2% payment reduction created under the sequestration required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012), and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030.
 The regulatory agencies under whose purview we operate have administrative powers that may subject us to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions.
In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S. by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties under applicable laws. These laws include anti-kickback, false claims laws, civil monetary penalties laws, data privacy and security laws, and physician payment transparency laws. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks related to government regulation—We are subject to healthcare regulations that could result in liability, require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future.”
