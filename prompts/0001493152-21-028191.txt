ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
 
General Development of the Business
 
In this 10-K, “we”, “us”, “our”, “MREIC” or “the Company”, refers to Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation, together with its predecessors and subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.
 
We are a Maryland corporation that qualifies as a real estate investment trust (REIT) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Our investment focus is to own well-located, modern, single-tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. We were founded in 1968 and have been publicly owned since that time, making us one of the oldest public equity REITs in the world. We intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT in the future. As a REIT, with limited exceptions, we will not be taxed under Federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders. For special tax provisions applicable to REITs, refer to Sections 856-860 of the Code. We are subject to franchise taxes in several of the states in which we own properties.
 
In December 2017, as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA), Code Section 199A was added to the Code and became effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Under the TCJA, subject to certain income limitations, an individual taxpayer and estates and trusts may deduct 20% of the aggregate amount of qualified REIT dividends they receive from their taxable income. Qualified REIT dividends do not include any portion of a dividend received from a REIT that is classified as a capital gain dividend or qualified dividend income.
 
We were established in 1968 as a New Jersey Business Trust (NJBT). In 1990, the NJBT merged into a newly formed Delaware corporation. On May 15, 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Delaware to Maryland by merging with and into a Maryland corporation.
 
As previously announced, on November 5, 2021, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Industrial Logistics Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (“ILPT”), under which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, ILPT will acquire us in an all-cash transaction, with our common stockholders receiving $21.00 in cash for each outstanding share of our common stock in connection with consummation of the transaction. ILPT’s acquisition of us is subject to obtaining the requisite approval of our common stockholders and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Upon closing of the merger with ILPT, holders of our outstanding 6.125% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”) will receive the amount of $25 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. We plan to continue to pay our regular quarterly common stock dividend and our Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock dividend for each full quarterly dividend period completed prior to the closing of the transaction. This transaction with ILPT represents the culmination of the publicly announced comprehensive strategic alternatives review processes conducted by our Board of Directors during 2021. Our Board re-initiated its strategic alternatives review process in September 2021 after a previous agreement for a merger that we entered into with another party, following a strategic alternatives review process earlier this year, did not receive the requisite approval of our stockholders.

Description of Business
 
Our primary business is the ownership and management of industrial real estate properties. Our investment focus is to own well-located, modern, single-tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. At September 30, 2021, we held investments in 122 properties totaling 24.9 million square feet with an overall occupancy rate of 99.7% (See Item 2 for a detailed description of the properties). As of the fiscal yearend, our weighted average lease expiration was 7.0 years, our annualized average base rent per occupied square foot was $6.61 and the weighted average building age, based on the square footage of our buildings, was 10.2 years. These properties are located in 32 states: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. All of these properties are 100% owned by us, directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries, with the exception of one property in New Jersey in which we own a majority interest. All of our investment properties are leased on a net basis except for an industrial park in Monaca (Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania and our only non-industrial asset, which is a shopping center, located in Somerset, New Jersey. Our investments are primarily located in strategic locations and, in many cases our buildings are highly automated in order to serve the omni-channel distribution networks that have become essential today. Approximately 83% of our revenue is derived from investment-grade tenants, or their subsidiaries as defined by S&P Global Ratings (www.standardandpoors.com) and by Moody’s (www.moodys.com). The references in this report to S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s are not intended to and do not include, or incorporate by reference into this report, the information of S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s on such websites.
 
Our portfolio of modern, net-leased industrial properties continues to provide shareholders with reliable and predictable income streams. Our resilient high occupancy rates and rent collection results highlight the mission-critical nature of our assets and underscore the essential need for our tenants’ operations. Furthermore, because our weighted average lease term is 7.0 years and our weighted average fixed rate mortgage debt maturity is 10.9 years, we expect our cash flow to remain resilient over long periods of time. Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic, our overall occupancy rate has been over 99% and is currently 99.7%. Our base rent collections remained strong, averaging 99.9% throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic and we expect future months to be consistent with this trend.
 
US industrial real estate market conditions are as strong as they have ever been with record high asking rents, a robust development pipeline, and an all-time high occupancy rate of 96%. Companies are leasing space at record levels to handle the large increase in ecommerce sales as well as the need for safety stock to counter supply chain disruptions. Construction costs are rising dramatically due to the long lead times for sourcing materials. The amount of new construction for US industrial real estate has been increasing for several years as more industrial space is needed to handle direct-to-consumer distribution. It is estimated that ecommerce sales require three times the amount of warehouse space relative to brick and mortar retail sales. These new buildings are often highly automated and have much larger truck courts and parking requirements. Because modern industrial buildings are built to handle both wholesale distribution as well as direct to consumer distribution, they are known as omni-channel facilities. The West coast ports are continuing to experience severe bottlenecks in processing imports and as a result much container traffic is being diverted towards the Gulf and East coast ports. Given our geographic footprint, this trend is a very favorable one for us. For further discussion of potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see Item 1A: Risk Factors below.
 
During fiscal 2021, we purchased four industrial properties totaling 1.6 million square feet situated on 316.2 acres resulting in a very expansive land to building ratio of 8.8 to 1. All four properties are leased to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries, with net-leased terms ranging from 15 to 20 years, resulting in a weighted average lease maturity of 17.1 years. Three of the four properties, consisting of 903,000 square feet, or 58% of the total square footage of the four properties, are leased to FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., a subsidiary of FedEx Corporation (FDX). The aggregate purchase price for the four properties was $258.4 million. These four properties are located in the following Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs): Columbus, OH, Atlanta, GA, Burlington, VT and Knoxville, TN. These four properties are expected to generate annualized rental income over the life of their leases of $15.2 million. In connection with two of the four properties acquired during the 2021 fiscal year, we entered into one 17 year, fully-amortizing mortgage loan and one 15 year, fully-amortizing mortgage loan. In connection with the remaining two properties acquired during the 2021 fiscal year, we entered into commitments for two, 15 year, fully-amortizing mortgage loans, which have not yet closed. These four fully-amortizing loans have a weighted average term of 15.7 years. The principal amount of the four mortgage loans originally totaled $161.8 million with fixed interest rates ranging from 2.50% to 3.25%, resulting in a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.89%.

During fiscal 2021, we completed the first phase of a two-phase parking expansion project for FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. at our property located in Olathe (Kansas City), KS. The first phase of this parking expansion project was completed for a total cost of $3.4 million, resulting in an initial increase in annual rent effective November 5, 2020 of approximately $340,000 from approximately $2.1 million, or $6.83 per square foot, to approximately $2.5 million, or $7.91 per square foot. Furthermore, annual rent increased by 2.1% on June 1, 2021 and will continue to increase 2.1% every five years, resulting in an annualized rent from November 5, 2021 through the remaining term of the lease of approximately $2.6 million, or $8.15 per square foot. We recently began construction on the second phase of this parking expansion project at this location, which upon completion will further increase the rental rate and extend the lease term. In addition, effective June 4, 2021, we completed a parking lot expansion for UPS at our property located in Halfmoon (Albany), NY for a cost of approximately $835,000, resulting in an initial increase in annual rent effective on the date of completion of approximately $52,000 from approximately $510,000, or $6.80 per square foot, to approximately $562,000, or $7.50 per square foot. Furthermore, annual rent will continue to increase each year by 2.0% resulting in an annualized rent from June 4, 2021 through the remaining term of the lease of approximately $622,000, or $8.29 per square foot. Due to the proliferation of ecommerce sales and last mile deliveries, it is important to take into account the large amounts of real estate utilized for trailer, van, and car parking at many of our properties in determining how our in-place rental rates compare to market rental rates for properties being used in a similar manner. Rents per square foot on properties that may be nearby, but have only limited acreage devoted to parking, are poor comparisons as they cannot accommodate the same tenant needs.
 
Subsequent to fiscal yearend, on October 27, 2021, we purchased a newly constructed 291,000 square foot industrial building, situated on 46.0 acres, located in the Birmingham, AL MSA. The building is 100% net-leased to FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. for 15 years through July 2036. The purchase price was $30.2 million. We obtained a mortgage loan commitment for a 15 year, fully-amortizing mortgage loan of $19.3 million at a fixed interest rate of 2.40%, which has not yet closed. Annual rental revenue over the remaining term of the lease averages $1.7 million.
 
In addition to the $30.2 million property purchased in October 2021, we have entered into agreements to purchase three new build-to-suit, industrial buildings that are currently being developed in Alabama, Georgia and Texas, totaling 1.1 million square feet. These future acquisitions have net-leased terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with a weighted average lease term of 12.6 years. The total purchase price for these three properties is $126.8 million. All three properties are leased to companies, or subsidiaries of companies, that are considered Investment Grade by S&P Global Ratings (www.standardandpoors.com) and by Moody’s (www.moodys.com). Two of these three properties, consisting of an aggregate of 563,000 square feet, or 52% of the total leasable area, are leased to FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. Subject to satisfactory due diligence and other customary closing conditions and requirements, we anticipate closing all three of these transactions during fiscal 2022.
 
We have several FedEx Ground parking expansion projects in progress with more under discussion. Currently there are nine parking expansion projects underway, which we expect to cost approximately $42.6 million. These parking expansion projects will enable us to capture additional rent while lengthening the terms of these leases. We are also in discussions to expand the parking at eight additional locations bringing the total recently completed and likely future parking lot expansion projects to 18 currently.
 
We may have additional acquisitions and expansions in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, and the funds for these acquisitions are expected to come from funds generated from operations, mortgages, draws on our unsecured line of credit facility, cash on hand, sales of marketable securities, other bank borrowings, proceeds from the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP), proceeds from the sale of common stock in a possible future at-the-market public offering (similar to our previous common stock at-the-market offering) and proceeds from private placements and other public offerings of additional common or preferred stock or other securities. To the extent that funds or appropriate properties are not available, fewer acquisitions will be made.
 
On January 14, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a 5.9% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend, raising it to $0.18 per share from $0.17 per share representing an annualized dividend rate of $0.72 per share. This increase was the third dividend increase in the past five years, representing a total increase of 20%. We have maintained or increased our common stock cash dividend for 30 consecutive years. We are also one of the few REITs that maintained its dividend throughout the Global Financial Crisis.
 
On October 1, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.18 per share, to be paid on December 15, 2021, to common shareholders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2021, which represents an annualized common dividend rate of $0.72 per share. We intend to pay these distributions from cash flows from operations.

Our common stock dividend policy is dependent upon our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, availability and cost of bank financing and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors. It is our intention to continue making comparable quarterly distributions in the future and to grow our distributions over time.
 
Currently, we derive our income primarily from real estate rental operations. Rental and Reimbursement Revenue (excluding Lease Termination Income in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 of $377,000, $-0-, and $-0-, respectively) was $182.8 million, $167.8 million and $154.8 million for the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Total undepreciated assets (which is our total assets excluding accumulated depreciation) were $2.6 billion and $2.2 billion as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
As of September 30, 2021, we had 24.9 million leasable square feet, of which 11.6 million square feet, or 47%, consisting of 65 separate stand-alone leases, were leased to FDX and its subsidiaries (5% to FDX and 42% to FDX subsidiaries). These properties are located in 27 different states. As of September 30, 2021, the 65 separate stand-alone leases that are leased to FDX and FDX subsidiaries had a weighted average lease maturity of 7.5 years. As of September 30, 2021, in addition to FDX and its subsidiaries, the only other tenants that leased 5% or more of our total square footage were subsidiaries of Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon), which are parties to five separate stand-alone leases for properties located in four different states, containing 1.5 million total square feet, comprising 6% of our total leasable square feet. None of our properties are subject to a master lease or any cross-collateralization agreements.
 
Our Rental and Reimbursement Revenue from FDX and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, totaled $104.3 million, $96.4 million and $93.3 million, or calculated as a percentage of total rent and reimbursement revenues were, 57% (5% from FDX and 52% from FDX subsidiaries), 58% (5% from FDX and 53% from FDX subsidiaries) and 60% (5% from FDX and 55% from FDX subsidiaries). In addition to FDX and its subsidiaries, the only tenants to comprise 5% or more of our total Rental and Reimbursement Revenue were subsidiaries of Amazon, which represented 6% of our Rental and Reimbursement Revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. Rental and Reimbursement Revenue from subsidiaries of Amazon for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 was less than 5% of our Rental and Reimbursement Revenue.
 
FDX and Amazon are publicly-listed companies and financial information related to these entities are available at the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov. FDX and Amazon are rated “BBB” and “AA”, respectively by S&P Global Ratings (www.standardandpoors.com) and are rated “Baa2” and “A1”, respectively by Moody’s (www.moodys.com), which are both considered “Investment Grade” ratings. The references in this report to the SEC’s website, S&P Global Ratings’ website and Moody’s website are not intended to and do not include, or incorporate by reference into this report, the information of FDX, Amazon, S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s on such websites.
 
Our weighted average lease expiration was 7.0 years and 7.1 years as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and our average annualized rent per occupied square foot as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 was $6.61 and $6.36, respectively. Our overall occupancy rate as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 was 99.7% and 99.4%, respectively. Our weighted average lease expiration has been 7.0 years or greater for over seven consecutive years. Our overall occupancy rate has been 98.9% or above for over six consecutive years.
 
We compete with other investors in real estate for attractive investment opportunities. These investors include other equity real estate investment trusts, limited partnerships, syndications and private investors, among others. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects acquisitions, occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of certain properties. We have built long-term relationships within our tenant base as well as within the merchant builder community. These relationships have historically provided us with investment opportunities that fit our investment policy.

Information about our Executive Officers
 
The following table sets forth information with respect to our executive officers as of September 30, 2021:
 

Name | Age | Position 
-----------------------+-----+-------------------------------------------
Eugene W. Landy | 87 | Chairman of the Board and Founder 
Michael P. Landy | 59 | President and Chief Executive Officer 
Kevin S. Miller | 51 | Chief Financial and Accounting Officer 
Michael D. Prashad | 36 | General Counsel 
Richard P. Molke | 36 | Vice President of Asset Management 

Human Capital Resources
 
As of September 30, 2021, we had 14 full-time employees. Women represent 57% of our employees with 37.5% holding management level/leadership roles. Employees are offered great flexibility to meet personal and family needs. We endeavor to maintain workplaces that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable law. We conduct training to prevent harassment and discrimination and monitor employee conduct year-round. Recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement at the Company are based on the individual’s qualifications, performance, skills and experience. Our employees are fairly compensated, without regard to gender, race and ethnicity, and routinely recognized for outstanding performance. Our compensation program is designed to attract and retain talent. We continually assess and strive to enhance employee satisfaction and engagement. Our employees, many of whom have a long tenure with the Company, frequently express satisfaction with management. Our employees are offered regular opportunities to participate in professional development programs.
Investment and Other Policies
 
Our investment policy is to concentrate our investments in well-located, modern, single-tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. Our strategy is to obtain a favorable yield spread between the income from the net-leased industrial properties and interest costs. In addition, we believe that investments in well-located, modern industrial properties provide a potential for long-term capital appreciation. There is the risk that, upon expiration of leases, the properties will become vacant or will be re-leased at lower rents. The results obtained from re-leasing the properties will depend on the market for industrial properties at that time.
 
In fiscal 2021, approximately 5% of our gross leasable area, representing ten leases totaling 1.2 million square feet, was set to expire. All ten of these leases have been renewed, resulting in a 100% retention rate for a weighted average term of 4.2 years. These ten lease renewals resulted in a U.S. GAAP straight-line weighted average lease rate of $4.77 per square foot. The renewed weighted average initial cash rent per square foot is $4.66. This compares to the former weighted average rent of $4.49 per square foot on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and the former weighted average cash rent of $4.64 per square foot, resulting in an increase in the weighted average lease rate of 6.2% on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and an increase in the weighted average lease rate of 0.4% on a cash basis.
 
We seek to invest in well-located, modern, single-tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. In management’s opinion, the recently acquired facilities meet these criteria. We have a concentration of properties leased to FDX and FDX subsidiaries and to subsidiaries of Amazon. This is a risk that shareholders should consider. FDX and Amazon are publicly-listed companies and financial information related to these entities are available at the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov. FDX and Amazon are rated “BBB” and “AA”, respectively by S&P Global Ratings (www.standardandpoors.com) and are rated “Baa2” and “A1”, respectively by Moody’s (www.moodys.com), which are both considered “Investment Grade” ratings. The references in this report to the SEC’s website, S&P Global Ratings’ website and Moody’s website are not intended to and do not include, or incorporate by reference into this report, the information of FDX, Amazon, S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s on such websites.

We have considered issuing securities for property; however, this has not occurred to date. We may repurchase or reacquire our shares from time to time if, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, such acquisition is in our best interest. On September 14, 2021, our Board of Directors reaffirmed our Common Stock Repurchase Program (the “Program”) that authorizes us to purchase up to $50.0 million of shares of our common stock. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchase will be determined by us at our discretion and will be subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The Program does not have a termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at our discretion without prior notice. During fiscal 2020, we repurchased 400,000 shares of our common stock for $4.3 million at an average price of $10.69 per share. These were the only repurchases made under the Program thus far.
 
Property Management
 
With the exception of two properties, all of our 122 properties are self-managed by us.
 
For the properties we self-manage, we paid fees directly to local property management subagents of $518,000, $482,000 and $468,000 for fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory laws and requirements, including, but not limited to, the Americans with Disabilities Act, zoning regulations, building codes and land use laws, and building, occupancy and other permit requirements. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants. While we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us. Additionally, local zoning and land use laws, environmental statutes and other governmental requirements may restrict, or negatively impact, our property operations, or expansion, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities and such regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economic opportunities. Future changes in federal, state or local tax regulations applicable to REITs, real property or income derived from our real estate, which may be retroactive, could impact the financial performance, operations, and value of our properties and the Company.
Tax Regulation
 
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year which ended September 30, 1968. Our qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual annual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the various qualification tests and organizational requirements imposed under the Code, as discussed below. We believe that we are organized and have operated in such a manner as to qualify under the Code for taxation as a REIT since our inception, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner.
 
To maintain our qualification as a REIT, two separate percentage tests relating to the source of our gross income must be satisfied annually. First, at least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year generally must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property (including dividends paid by other REITs, mortgages on real property, “rents from real property,” gain, and, in certain circumstances, interest) or from certain types of temporary investments. Second, at least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must be derived from such real property investments described above, dividends, interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, or from any combination of the foregoing. Rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” in satisfying the above gross income tests only if several conditions are met. First, the amount of rent generally must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person. However, amounts received or accrued generally will not be excluded from “rents from real property” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of gross receipts or sales. Second, rents received from a tenant will not qualify as “rents from real property” if we, or a direct or indirect owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively own 10% or more of such tenant. Third, if rent attributable to personal property that is leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property.” This 15% test is based on relative fair market values of the real and personal property. Generally, for rents to qualify as “rents from real property” for the purposes of the gross income tests, we are only allowed to provide services that are both “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “rendered to the occupant.” Further, for the rent paid pursuant to our leases to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement. We structure our leases to generate qualifying income.

-


In addition to the income tests discussed above, to maintain our qualification as a REIT, at the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must satisfy seven tests relating to the nature of our assets. We limit our investments to assets that will allow us to meet these requirements:
 

● | At least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by “real estate assets”, cash, cash items and government securities, as such terms are defined in the Code. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities, other than those in the 75% asset class. 
● | Except for certain investments in REITs, taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs) and other securities in the 75% asset class, the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets. 
● | Except for certain investments in REITs, TRSs and other securities in the 75% asset class, we may not own more than 10% of the total voting power of any one issuer’s outstanding securities. 
● | Except for certain investments in REITs, TRSs and other securities in the 75% asset class, we may not own more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer, other than securities that qualify for the debt safe harbors. 
● | The aggregate value of all securities of TRSs held by us may not exceed 20% of the value of our gross assets. 
● | No more than 25% of the value of our total assets may consist of debt instruments issued by “publicly offered REITs” (i.e., a REIT that is required to file annual and periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the extent such debt instruments are not secured by real property or interests in real property. 

 
Finally, in order to qualify as a REIT, we must, among other requirements, distribute, each year, to our shareholders at least 90 percent of our taxable income, excluding net capital gains. To the extent that we satisfy the 90 percent distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100 percent of our taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed income and may incur a 4 percent nondeductible excise tax on the amount not distributed. As a result, we distribute substantially all of our taxable income in each year, and must seek other sources of capital to fund our operations and growth.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, an owner of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, in or under such property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances. These liabilities may include government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or disposal of such substances. Although generally our tenants are primarily responsible for any environmental damages and claims related to the leased premises, in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of a tenant of such premises to satisfy any obligations with respect to such environmental liability, we may be required to satisfy such obligations. In addition, as the owner of such properties, we may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims irrespective of the provisions of any lease.


From time to time, in connection with managing the properties or upon acquisition of a property, we authorize the preparation of Phase I and, when necessary, Phase II environmental reports with respect to our properties. Based upon such environmental reports and our ongoing review of our properties, as of the date of this Annual Report, we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties which we believe would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations. There can be no assurance, however, that (1) the discovery of environmental conditions, the existence or severity of which were previously unknown; (2) changes in law; (3) the conduct of tenants; or (4) activities relating to properties in the vicinity of our properties, will not expose us to material liability in the future.
