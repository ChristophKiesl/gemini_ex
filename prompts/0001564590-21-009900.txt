 COVID-19 Impact on our Business
 The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted global economic activity, including within the automotive market and our business. Our sales are driven by the number of light vehicles produced by OEMs and our content per vehicle. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted, and is expected to continue to significantly disrupt, the global automotive industry and customer sales, production volumes and purchases of light vehicles by end consumers. Per IHS Markit (February 2021 release), global light vehicle production volume was down 14.4% in 2020 from 2019 in the Company’s key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea. In the first half of 2020, we were adversely affected by temporary manufacturing closures and customer plant closures, supply chain and production disruptions, workforce restrictions and travel restrictions, among other factors. While the operations of the Company, our customers and our supply chain improved in the second half of the year, the pandemic continued to adversely impact various aspects of our operations during such period.  
 Our business is subject to continuing and uncertain risks depending on the progression of the pandemic and the recovery of the global economy. In addition to challenges faced in 2020, recent pandemic-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts and manufacturing delays. Similarly, increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of semiconductors, and it is yet unknown how we may be impacted. Our suppliers have experienced plant closures and production delays, and may continue to experience delays in manufacturing the materials and products we require according to our schedule and specifications. Certain companies in our supply chain have had significant employee layoffs or furloughs and have significant financial distress, and some may determine to cease operations or restructure their business. As a result, we and our supply chain may operate significantly below capacity for an uncertain

period of time. Further, COVID-19 has had, and we expect will continue to have, a significant adverse impact on the growth, viability and financial stability of our customers, including the OEMs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers to which our products are supplied.
 The Company has implemented additional health and safety precautions and protocols in response to the pandemic and government guidelines to help ensure the safety and health of its employees. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our non-production employees are now working from home. We continue to assess and update business continuity plans in the context of this pandemic.  
 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on global automotive markets in 2021, in the form of supply chain and production disruptions, workforce restrictions, travel restrictions and reduced consumer spending, among other factors.  There remains substantial uncertainty regarding the global economic impact of, and the speed and shape of the recovery from, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including for the global automotive industry and the resulting impact on our future operations and financial results.  See further discussion of the risks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related risks in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Segments
 The Company has two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Automotive and Medical.
 Automotive 
 The Automotive reporting segment is comprised of the results from our global automotive businesses. Operating results from our climate comfort systems, automotive cable systems, battery performance solutions, automotive electronic and software systems and our advanced research and development organization are all reported in the Automotive segment because of their complementary focus on automotive content, passenger thermal comfort and convenience.  In 2020, we added our advanced research and development organization to this reporting segment.
 Climate comfort systems include seat heaters, blowers and thermoelectric devices for variable temperature Climate Control Seats (“CCS”) and steering wheel heaters designed to provide individualized thermal comfort to automobile passengers, and integrated electronic components, such as electronic control units that utilize our proprietary electronics technology and software. Other climate comfort systems include neck conditioners and climate control system products for door panels, armrests, cupholders and storage bins.
 Battery performance solutions (formerly battery thermal management) consist of cell connecting devices used for various types of automotive batteries and thermal management products for heating and cooling 12V, 48V and high voltage batteries and battery modules.
 Automotive electronic and software systems include electronic control units for climate comfort systems, electronic control units for memory seat modules and other devices.
 Medical
 In 2018 and 2019, our Industrial reporting segment represented the combined results from our patient temperature management systems business (“Medical”), remote power generation systems business, Gentherm Global Power Technologies (“GPT”) (through its divestiture on October 1, 2019), environmental test equipment business, Cincinnati Sub Zero industrial chamber business (“CSZ-IC”) (through its divestiture on February 1, 2019) and non-automotive expenses from our advanced research and development division (through December 31, 2019). The operating results from these businesses and division previously were presented together as one reporting segment because of their historical joint concentration on identifying new markets and product applications based on thermal management technologies.
 In 2020, the Industrial reporting segment was renamed the Medical reporting segment to reflect the patient temperature management business as the focus and strategic direction of this segment. Also, during 2020, the advanced research and development costs not associated with the Medical segment were moved to the Automotive segment, as this organization primarily supports the Automotive related research and development activities following the divestitures of GPT and CSZ-IC.

 Additional product development is performed at all of our manufacturing facilities to support customers.  We believe the localized development model employed at our global design and manufacturing facilities improves our ability to effectively serve our customers and increases our innovative capacity.
 Core Technologies 
 Gentherm’s expertise in thermal management is focused on two general areas: managing the thermal conditions of people and objects.  
 ClimateSenseTM
 ClimateSense is an integrated comfort system we are designing to create a personalized microclimate for passengers using localized convective, conductive and radiative heating and cooling products.  Using automatic regulation technology in combination with our unique occupant-centric control algorithm, ClimateSense offers the ability to personalize and improve overall occupant thermal comfort, improve time to comfort with (all-electric) pre-conditioning, provide comfort with less energy consumption thereby lowering carbon dioxide emissions by conventional internal combustion and hybrid powertrains, and extend range for electrified powertrains through a reduction in central HVAC system usage.
Electronics
 Gentherm manufactures and supplies electronics to our core climate comfort solution products.  We also supply value-added electronic products to third parties for adjacent areas within the automotive interior.  In addition, Gentherm manufacturers and supplies electronic control units for memory seat modules that include electric motor position sensing technology. This technology further applies to other automotive products requiring fine motor controls. 
Air Moving Devices
 Our highly durable and quiet air moving devices, including our proprietary blower and fan designs, are essential to all of our products that require air movement. We have a strong portfolio of these products, tailored to various automotive application, including seat ventilation and EV battery cooling.

Thermoelectric Technologies
 Many of our thermal products manage the thermal conditions of people and objects using our internally developed advanced thermoelectric device technology (“TED”). A TED is a solid-state circuit that has the capability to produce both hot and cold thermal conditions by use of the Peltier effect. The advantages of advanced TEDs over conventional compressed gas systems are that they are environmentally friendly and less complex as they have no moving parts and are compact and light weight.  Over the last 19 years, our work on this technology has yielded improvements in areas of functionality, efficiency, durability and performance. 
Resistive Heaters 
 Resistive heater technologies are comprised of wire, carbon fiber or positive thermal coefficient (“PTC”) heating elements that quickly and effectively deliver heat to people and objects.  Wire heating elements are designed from stainless steel, copper, our proprietary carbon fiber woven lattice technology called Carbotex® or printed circuit PTC heaters based on the specifications for a particular product application.  Resistive heaters have multiple automotive applications, including seat heating, steering wheel heating, interior panel heating, and battery heating.

Products
 Climate Comfort Solutions – Seat Comfort
 Climate Control Seat® (“CCS”)
 Our CCS products utilize exclusive patented technology to regulate temperature and enhance the comfort of vehicle passengers. The most advanced CCS models use one or more TEDs to generate heating or cooling depending upon the direction of the current applied to the device.
 A TED is the heart of a compact heat pump used in our active CCS products. Air is forced through the heat pump and thermally conditioned in response to electronic switch input from the seat occupant. The conditioned air circulates by one of our specially designed air moving devices through a proprietary air distribution system installed in the seat cushion and seat back, so that the seat surface can be heated or cooled. Each seat has individual electronic controls to adjust the level of heating or cooling. Active CCS products improve comfort compared with conventional air conditioners by focusing cooling directly on the passenger through the seat rather than waiting until ambient air cools the seat surface beneath the passenger.  A heated and ventilated variant of the CCS utilizes ambient cabin air to provide cooling comfort instead of a TED to actively cool the seat. In the heating mode, both the vent-only system and the TED system can be supplemented with resistive heating elements.  
 Heated and ventilated CCS products provide a lower level of cooling capability than our active CCS solution, but at a lower price. By offering different models of the CCS product, our customers have the opportunity to purchase a wider range of climate control products at different price points. Sales of CCS products contributed 38%, 37% and 36% to our total product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  
 Heated Seat 
 Heated seats, based on our resistive heater core technology, are seamlessly integrated into automotive seat designs, and are constructed using materials that offer the best capacity, installation characteristics and durability.  Our capabilities allow customers to choose among a variety of resistive heater materials based on their individual vehicle specifications. Sales of heated seat products contributed 27%, 29% and 29% to our total product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  
Neck Climate Control Systems
 Neck climate control systems ventilate warm or temperature-controlled air directly onto the passenger’s neck area. The system combines electronics, air moving device technologies and a heating element into a compact, integrated headrest design that can be adjusted to suit the body size of the passenger.   
Climate Comfort Solutions – Surface Climate Control Systems

Gentherm is now focused on globalizing the Stihler portfolio and integrating across key sales channels.  
 Customers 
 Our Automotive segment customers include light vehicle OEMs, commercial vehicle OEMs and first tier (“Tier 1”) suppliers to the automotive OEMs, including automotive seat manufacturers.  We also directly supply CCS products to aftermarket seat distributors and installers. 
 The Company’s automotive marketing is directed primarily at automotive manufacturers and their Tier 1 suppliers and focuses on the enhanced value consumers attribute to vehicles with climate comfort products. In many cases, the manufacturers direct us to work with their suppliers to integrate our products into the vehicle’s seat or interior design. These customers will sell our product, as a component of an entire seat or seating system, to automotive OEMs. Once the integration work is complete, prototypes are sent to the manufacturer for evaluation and testing. If a manufacturer accepts our product, a program can then be launched for a particular model on a production basis, but it normally takes one to three years from the time a manufacturer decides to include any of our products in a vehicle model to actual production for that vehicle. During this process, we derive funding from prototype sales but obtain no significant revenue until mass production begins. Inherent to the automotive supplier market are costs and commitments that are incurred well in advance of the receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers.
 The volume of products we sell is significantly affected by global automotive production levels and the general business conditions in the automotive industry. Our product revenues are generally based upon purchase orders issued by our customers, with updated releases for volume adjustments. As such, we typically do not have a backlog of firm orders at any point in time. Once selected to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the platform life, which is normally five to seven years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. 
 For 2020, our revenues from sales to our two largest customers, Lear and Adient were $141 million and $132 million, respectively, representing 15% and 14% of our product revenues, respectively. Revenues from Lear and Adient represent sales of our climate comfort products.  The loss of these customers would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. However, as noted above, in many cases OEMs direct their suppliers such as Lear and Adient to work with us for our climate comfort solutions, battery performance solutions and cable technology products. It is, therefore, relevant to understand how our revenues are divided among the OEMs, as shown below. 
 10

Our total product revenues for each of the past three years were divided among automotive OEMs as follows:

In March 2020, we announced the initial phase of this restructuring plan, which includes the 
 11

consolidation of all North American electronics manufacturing to Celaya, Mexico. This will result in the closure of the Burlington, Canada facility, and the transfer of electronics manufacturing to Acuña, Mexico.  In December 2020, we announced the consolidation of our electronics manufacturing in Asia to Bantian, Shenzhen, China, which will result in the closure of our Longgang, Shenzhen, China facility that is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. See Note 5, "Restructuring" of the consolidated financial statements included in this Report for additional information.
 The automotive industry is highly reliant on semiconductors and, beginning in the fourth quarter 2020 and continuing in 2021, is facing a significant supply shortage of semiconductors. In the first half of 2020, global semiconductor manufacturers and their distributors allocated capacity to meet surging demand for consumer electronics and away from the automotive sector that was experiencing plant shutdowns. Given capacity constraints and long lead times for restarting production, semiconductor manufacturers became further strained when automotive vehicle production and other industries utilizing semiconductors had a strong rebound in the second half of 2020. Such activity has resulted in significant supply shortages and cost increases across the automotive industry, and has an adverse impact on our business.  We continue to closely monitor the availability of semiconductor microchips and other key component parts and raw materials, as well as customer vehicle production schedules that may be impacted by supply shortages and disruptions.  We are working closely with our suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts. See further discussion of the risks relating to the supply shortage of semiconductors and related risks in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Proprietary Rights and Patents
The development of new or improved technologies is critical to the execution of our business strategy. Patents obtained for new or improved technologies form an important basis for the success of the Company and underpin the success of our research and development efforts. We have adopted a policy of obtaining, where practical, the exclusive rights to use technology related to our products through patents or licenses for proprietary technologies or processes. We adapt and commercialize such technologies in products for mass production. We also have developed technologies or furthered the development of acquired technologies through internal research and development efforts. 
 As of December 31, 2020, Gentherm held 518 issued patents, of which 253 were U.S. patents and 265 were non-U.S. patents.

Key Highlights of our Human Capital Strategy
 Health and Safety
 At Gentherm, safety is an essential part of our operating model. Our safety focus has never been more critical over the last year, during our response to the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  Paramount to our efforts, has been creating a safe working environment for our employees through creation of a COVID-19 safe work playbook.  We implemented safe work protocols, personal protective equipment enhancements, screening protocols and work area layout modifications.

Frequent and transparent communications with our team members was also critical to business continuity and COVID-19 recovery planning.  Our employee pulse survey on COVID-19 actions boasted a more than 80% confidence level in management’s leadership throughout the pandemic.
