Ophthalmologists typically use our laser systems in hospital operating rooms (“ORs”) and ambulatory surgical centers (“ASCs”), as well as their offices and clinics. In the ORs and ASCs, ophthalmologists use our laser systems with either an indirect laser ophthalmoscope or a consumable, single use MP3 probe, G-Probe or EndoProbe. 
 Our products are sold in the United States predominantly through a direct sales force and internationally through independent distributors.  Total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $46.2 million, $41.8 million and $42.8 million, respectively. We generated net (loss) income of $(11.7) million, $0.5 million and $10.0 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 IRIDEX Corporation was incorporated in California in February 1989 as IRIS Medical Instruments, Inc.  In January 1996, we changed our name to IRIDEX Corporation and reincorporated in Delaware.  Our executive offices are located at 1212 Terra Bella Avenue, Mountain View, California 94043-1824, and our telephone number is (650) 940-4700. We can also be reached at our website at www.IRIDEX.com, however, the information on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of this report. 
 Our Market Opportunity
 Ophthalmology is a large and growing global market that is driven by the aging world population and the onset of chronic diseases.  We currently target the glaucoma and retina disease markets. 
Glaucoma
 Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the world. Glaucoma is a progressive, chronic disease and vision loss resulting from glaucoma currently cannot be regained. According to Market Scope, more than 80 million people worldwide have glaucoma with only 24.7 million people that have been diagnosed.   Glaucoma is most commonly associated with elevated levels of pressure within the eye, or intraocular pressure (“IOP”).  Elevated IOP often occurs when aqueous humor, the thin watery fluid that fills the front of the eye, is not circulating normally and draining properly.  Currently, reducing IOP is the only proven treatment for glaucoma with treatments primarily focused on improving the flow of aqueous humor through the eye’s trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral outflow pathways.  Market Scope estimates 2015 global sales of $5.0 billion for products used to treat glaucoma.  
 Pharmaceutical products represent $4.7 billion of this estimate but have significant shortcomings.  Pharmaceuticals are typically the first treatment method prescribed for glaucoma. These pharmaceutical treatments are commonly self-administered in drop form by the patients. Patients often have difficulties applying the pharmaceutical drops properly and may fail to appropriately or timely apply the medication, which may significantly reduce the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical. This poor adherence to and lack of persistence with glaucoma medication regimens have been documented in numerous independent studies, which often place the incidence of patient noncompliance up to or above 50%, particularly in patients on two or more prescription eye drops.  Even when administered correctly, pharmaceuticals have demonstrated reduced efficacy over time. 
 When pharmaceuticals lose their effectiveness, appropriate treatment options are determined based on the progression and severity of the disease and include traditional laser therapy (e.g. selective laser trabeculoplasty (“SLT”), minimally invasive stents/shunts (e.g. MIGS), and open surgery (e.g. trabeculectomy).    These treatment alternatives also have significant shortcomings due to treatment effects that dissipate over time, repeat procedures that are less effective or not clinically advised, limited indications of use, and have significant complication risks. 
 We believe that because of the limitations of these traditional treatment alternatives, a clear unmet medical need exists in the management of glaucoma patients. 
 Medical Retina
 Market Scope estimates 2015 global sales of $9.0 billion for products used to treat retina diseases. Our medical retina business focuses on the treatment of diabetic macular edema (“DME”) which is part of a broader disease state called diabetic retinopathy.  Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes which impairs vision over time and if left untreated can lead to blindness. It is projected by 2030 that there will be 430 million diabetic patients globally.  Previous clinical publications indicated 28.5% of diabetic patients can develop some form of diabetic retinopathy. Traditional laser photocoagulation and a regimen of injected pharmaceuticals are currently the standard treatment for this disease and are associated with significant shortcomings.  Traditional laser photocoagulation can stabilize the patient’s vision over the long term but presents a risk of varying degrees of vision loss to the patient.  Pharmaceuticals can stabilize vision in the near term 
 4


but require repeated injections.  The injections are painful and the patients may experience side effects including increased risk of eye infections.  Furthermore, a regimen of repeated pharmaceutical injections is very costly to the physician and patient, in terms of time, and to the healthcare system, in terms of dollars spent on treatment. 
 The shortcomings in treating retinal diseases have led to a renewed interest in alternative approaches that may provide better or comparable patient outcomes at lower costs. 
 Our Solution 
 Our traditional laser technology was developed to perform laser photocoagulation by using a mode which delivers continuously-on laser light, which is referred to as continuous wave (“CW”) mode.  Laser photocoagulation generates a local healing response and has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective therapy with long-term benefits for certain ophthalmic procedures.  However, use of the CW mode typically leads to local tissue damage and can cause loss of visual function, which limits the applications of the technology. 
 We developed our proprietary MicroPulse technology with the goal of harnessing the clinical benefits of CW mode without causing the associated tissue damage.  MicroPulse is a method of delivering laser energy using a mode which chops the CW beam into short, microsecond long, laser pulses. The laser pulses are intended to generate the desired therapeutic response while the time in between laser pulses is believed to enable the tissue to cool and thereby avoid tissue damage.  This is analogous to holding one’s hand continuously over a candle versus waving it back and forth.  When held continuously, the candle would cause burning and scar tissue.  However, when exposed intermittently the candle only heats the tissue without burning.  
 There is a growing body of clinical evidence that has been published over the past 10 years that demonstrates that MicroPulse therapy is clinically effective with no detectible tissue damage for the treatment of glaucoma and retinal diseases.  Currently, we have developed three applications of our MicroPulse technology for the treatment of eye diseases:
 
 
MicroPulse Applications | Description 
Glaucoma – uveoscleral outflow | Treats glaucoma with our recently introduced Cyclo G6 laser system. MicroPulse laser is delivered through a proprietary single-use disposable probe we call the MicroPulse P3 (MP3) probe. By targeting an anatomical area of the eye called “Pars Plana” it is believed that the MP3 procedure may improve uveoscleral outflow and thus lowers IOP and may reduce the number of eye drop medications. We believe that the MP3 procedure has several important competitive advantages over alternative therapies with respect to invasiveness, sustained IOP reduction and does not inhibit the physicians from the use of alternative procedures. 
Glaucoma - trabecular meshwork outflow | Treats glaucoma with our IQ laser systems. MicroPulse laser is delivered through a mechanical and optical delivery device and targets the trabecular meshwork. Physicians describe the technique as MicroPulse Laser Trabeculoplasty (“MLT”). It is believed that the MLT procedure improves trabecular meshwork outflow and thus lowers IOP. We believe that the MLT procedure provides incremental clinical benefits relative to other laser trabeculoplasty procedures such as SLT. 
Medical Retina - DME | Treats DME with our IQ laser systems. MicroPulse laser is administered through a mechanical and optical delivery device that rapidly delivers multiple treatment spots on the retina. Our MicroPulse laser is uniquely believed to be “fovea friendly” in that the laser can be used to treat the fovea, the center of the field of vision in the retina, without any loss of visual function. Instead of causing thermal damage like traditional lasers, MicroPulse is believed to induce a therapeutic response through the recruitment of biological factors such as heat shock proteins. We believe that the treatment of DME with MicroPulse has several competitive advantages over alternate therapies with respect to long term vision stability, visual function, and cost effectiveness.

Our Strategy 
 We are one of the worldwide leaders in developing, manufacturing, marketing, selling and servicing innovative medical laser systems and associated instrumentation for the treatment of the sight-threatening eye diseases.  Our strategy is to leverage our existing brand and distribution channel in the ophthalmology market to promote the adoption of MicroPulse as a viable treatment alternative for glaucoma and retinal diseases and consequently to commercialize a broad array of products that: 

• | Improve therapeutic outcomes for patients suffering from sight-threatening eye diseases;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improve the efficiency of physicians and reduce their costs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide economic benefits to healthcare systems.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 To achieve these goals we are pursuing a number of organic initiatives which we anticipate will be supplemented from time to time by acquisitions. We anticipate that the successful execution of this strategy will lead to profitable growth and enhanced shareholder value. 
 Our Products
 We utilize a systems approach to product design. Each system includes a laser console, which generates the laser energy, and a number of interchangeable delivery devices for use in specific clinical applications. This approach allows our customers to purchase a basic laser system and add additional delivery devices as their needs expand or as new applications develop. We believe that this systems approach is our distinguishing characteristic and also brings economies-of-scale to our product development and manufacturing efforts because individual applications do not require the design and manufacture of complete stand-alone products. We offer three basic product categories: 1) lasers 2) delivery devices which are optical-mechanical products that mount to ophthalmologists diagnostic equipment and transmit the laser and 3) single-use disposable probes that transmit the laser light to a targeted region within the inside of an eye.
Laser Consoles 
 Our laser consoles, which are identified below, incorporate the economic and technical benefits of solid state and semiconductor laser technology. 
 Glaucoma: Cyclo G6  Laser System. The newest addition to our console portfolio, the Cyclo G6 is an infrared (810nm) laser designed to treat patients diagnosed with a range of glaucoma disease states. The product received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval in January 2015, and commenced commercial sales in March 2015. Unlike our other consoles, the Cyclo G6 system is sold with a family of probes that are single-use, including our patented MP3 disposable probe that utilizes our MicroPulse technology and our G-Probe.
 Medical retina: IQ laser systems. Our IQ laser systems are our typical MicroPulse laser platforms but also have CW capabilities.  Our IQ 577 delivers visible yellow (577nm) laser light and our IQ 532 delivers visible green (532nm) laser light. Our IQ laser systems are typically used with our TxCell Scanning Laser Delivery System and our Slit Lamp Adapters when used to treat DME with MicroPulse.  
 Surgical retina: OcuLight laser systems. Our OcuLight TX, OcuLight GL, and OcuLightGLx lasers deliver visible green (532nm) laser light. Our OcuLight SL and OcuLightSLx lasers deliver infrared (810 nm) laser light. 
 Delivery Devices
 The following delivery devices are typically used with our IQ and OcuLight laser systems:
 TxCell Scanning Laser Delivery System (“TxCell”). TxCell was initially introduced in 2012. It allows the physician to perform multi-spot pattern scanning for efficient delivery of our MicroPulse laser.  The TxCell has been an important contributor to the adoption of our IQ laser systems for the treatment of DME. 
 6


Slit Lamp Adapter (“SLA”). These adapters allow the physician to utilize a standard slit lamp in both diagnosis and treatment procedures. Physicians can install an SLA in a few minutes and convert standard diagnostic slit lamps into a therapeutic laser delivery system. SLAs are used in treatment procedures for both retinal diseases and glaucoma. 
 TruFocus Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope (“LIO”). The indirect ophthalmoscope is designed to be worn on the physician’s head and to be used in procedures to treat peripheral retinal disorders, particularly in infants or adults requiring treatment in the supine position. This product can be used in both diagnosis and treatment procedures at the point-of-care. 
 Single-use disposable probes
 MicroPulse P3 Probe. The MP3 Probe is used with our Cylco G6 laser systems and is our probe that delivers our MicroPulse laser to treat glaucoma.  It is believed that the MP3 procedure reduces IOP by improving uveoscleral outflow.  The MP3 Probe can be performed on an anesthetized eye in the doctor’s office or OR. The non-invasive procedure takes just a few minutes and results in minimal discomfort and post-operative recovery for the patient. We believe that the MP3 procedure may be used to treat a wide variety of glaucoma states, including early to late stage glaucoma as well as open-angle and closed angle glaucoma. The MP3 Probe is a sterile single-use product. 
 G-Probe. The G-Probe is used in procedures to treat uncontrolled glaucoma, typically described as “refractory glaucoma”.  The G-Probe delivers CW laser to the ciliary body and is believed to stop the production of aqueous humor, thus reducing IOP.  The G-Probe’s non-invasive procedure takes approximately ten minutes and is performed on an anesthetized eye in the doctor’s office or OR.  The G-Probe is a sterile single-use product.  
 G-Probe Illuminate. We recently received regulatory clearance for our G-Probe Illuminate which is also used in procedures to treat refractory glaucoma. The proprietary illumination feature allows for more targeted treatment and may offer additional clinical benefits.  The G-Probe Illuminate is a sterile single-use product.
 EndoProbe. Our EndoProbe family of products are used for endophotocoagulation, a retinal treatment procedure performed in the hospital OR or surgery center during a vitrectomy procedure.  Vitrectomy procedures are performed to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy, macular holes, retinal tears and detachments. These sterile disposable probes are available in tapered, angled, stepped, aspirating, illuminating, and adjustable styles, as well as a wide variety of sizes. The EndoProbe is a sterile single-use product.
 Research and Development
 We have close working relationships with researchers, clinicians and practicing physicians around the world who provide new ideas, test the feasibility of these new ideas and assist us in validating new products and new applications before they are introduced. 
 Our internal research and development (“R&D”) activities are performed by a current team of 20 engineers, scientists and regulatory professionals with experience in various aspects of medical products, laser systems, delivery devices, clinical techniques, and regulatory affairs with a focus on introducing innovative products which satisfy the unmet and emerging needs of our customers. The core competencies of the team include: mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, optics, lasers, fiber optics, software, firmware and delivery devices. The R&D process integrates all of the necessary disciplines of the Company from product inception through customer acceptance. This process facilitates reliable new product innovations and a consistent pipeline of innovative products for our customers. 
 Our research activities are managed internally by our R&D staff. We supplement our internal R&D staff by hiring consultants and/or partnering with physicians to gain specialized expertise and understanding. Research efforts are directed toward the development of new products and new applications for our existing products, as well as the identification of markets not currently addressed by our products. 
 We believe that it is important to make a substantial contribution to improving clinical outcomes. For instance, we have made substantial investments in researching and improving the treatment of serious eye diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and AMD. The objectives of developing new treatments and applications are to expand the potential patient population, to more effectively and more economically treat diseases, to treat patients earlier in the treatment regimen and to reduce the side effects of treatment. 
 We spent $5.4 million on R&D in 2016, $5.2 million in 2015 and $4.6 million in 2014. 
 We consider clinical projects to be a component of our R&D efforts and they may or may not result in additional commercial opportunities.

Customers and Customer Support 
 Our products are currently sold for use by ophthalmologists specializing in the treatment of eye disease in the retina, glaucoma and pediatrics eye diseases. Other customers include research and teaching hospitals, government installations, surgical centers, hospitals, and office clinics (outpatient). No single customer or distributor accounted for 10% or more of total revenues in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014. 
 We seek to provide superior customer support and service and believe that our customer service and technical support distinguish our product offerings from those of our competitors. We provide depot service at our Mountain View facility for our ophthalmology products. Our customer support representatives assist customers with orders, warranty returns and other administrative functions. Our technical support engineers provide customers with answers to technical and product-related questions. We maintain an “around-the-clock” telephone service line to service our customers. If a problem with a depot serviceable product cannot be diagnosed and resolved by telephone, a service loaner is shipped overnight to domestic customers under warranty or service contract, and by the most rapid delivery means available to our international customers, and the problem unit is returned to us. The small size and rugged design of our products allows for economical shipment and quick response to customers worldwide. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We sell and market our products in the United States predominantly through our direct sales force and internationally through independent distributors. Currently we have a direct sales force of 16 employees who are engaged in sales efforts within the United States and 5 personnel engaged in managing our distribution sales efforts internationally. We also contract for the services of 12 independent sales representatives to supplement our U.S. direct sales efforts. Our sales are administered through our corporate headquarters in Mountain View, California. 
 International sales represented 45.5%, 42.6% and 47.2% of our sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe that our international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Our international sales are made principally to customers in Europe, Asia, the Pacific Rim, the Middle East, Russia, Africa and Latin America. Our distribution agreements with our international distributors are generally exclusive and typically can be terminated by either party without cause with 90 days’ notice. International sales may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations, the imposition of governmental controls, restrictions on export technology, political instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and the economic condition in each country in which we sell our products. 
 To support our sales process, we conduct marketing programs which include: our website, clinical education, email marketing, trade shows, public relations, market research, and advertising in trade and academic journals and newsletters. We typically participate in over 85 trade shows worldwide on an annual basis. These meetings allow us to present our products to existing and prospective buyers. 
 Through marketing, we collaborate with our customers to identify new products and applications which help meet their needs, and in turn provides us with new product concepts, enhances our ability to identify new applications for our products and validates new procedures using our products. Customers include key opinion leaders who are often the heads of the departments in which they work or professors at universities. We believe that these luminaries in the field of ophthalmology are key to the successful introduction of new products and the subsequent acceptance of these new products by the general market. Acceptance of our products by these early adopters is key to our strategy in the validation and commercialization of our new products. 
 In March 2013, we entered into a global distribution and supply agreement with Peregrine Surgical Ltd. (“Peregrine”). Under the agreement, we became a worldwide distributor for Peregrine labeled products and Peregrine became part of the IRIDEX supply chain.
 Operations
 The manufacture of our visible light and infrared laser consoles and the related delivery devices is a highly complex and precise process. Completed systems must pass quality control and reliability tests before shipment. Our manufacturing activities consist of specifying, sourcing, assembling and testing of components and certain subassemblies for assembly into our final product. Currently we have a total of 17 employees engaged in manufacturing activities for these products. 
 The medical devices manufactured by us are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities, including federal, state, and foreign governmental agencies. The principal regulator in the United States is the FDA. In April 
 8


1998, we received certification for ISO 9001/EN 46001, which is an international quality system standard that documents compliance to the European Medical Device Directive. In February 2004, we were certified to ISO 13485:2003, which replaced ISO 9001/EN46001 as the international standard for quality systems as applied to medical devices. In August 2008, we received FDA 510(k) clearance on our family of IRIDEX IQ laser systems. This clearance covers the IRIDEX IQ 532 and IQ 577 laser systems and their associated delivery devices to deliver laser energy in either CW-Pulse, MicroPulse or LongPulse mode. In January 2015, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for Cyclo G6. These laser systems are intended for a wide range of specific applications in the medical specialties of ophthalmology. 
 International regulatory bodies often establish varying product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. As a result of our sales in Europe, we are required to have all products “CE” marked, an international symbol affixed to all products demonstrating compliance to the European Medical Device Directive and all applicable standards. In July 1998, we received CE mark certification under Annex II guidelines, the most stringent path to CE certification. With Annex II CE mark certification, we have demonstrated our ability to both understand and comply with all applicable standards under the European Medical Device Directive. Currently, all of our released products are CE marked. Continued certification is based on successful review of the process by our European Registrar during its annual audit. Any loss of certification would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We rely on third parties to manufacture substantially all of the components used in our products, although we assemble critical subassemblies and the final product at our facility in Mountain View, California. Some of these suppliers and manufacturers are sole source. We have some long-term or volume purchase agreements with our suppliers but currently purchase most components on a purchase order basis. These components may not be available in the quantities required, on reasonable terms, or at all. Financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability. Any failures by our third-party suppliers to adequately perform may delay the submission of products for regulatory approval, impair our ability to deliver products on a timely basis or otherwise impair our competitive position. 
 Competition
 Competition in the market for laser systems and delivery devices used for ophthalmic treatment procedures is intense and is expected to increase. This market is also characterized by technological innovation and change. We compete by providing features and services that are valued by our customers such as: enhanced product performance, and clinical outcomes, ease of use, durability, versatility, customer training services and rapid repair of equipment. 
 Our principal ophthalmic laser competitors are Alcon Inc. (Novartis AG), Bausch and Lomb (Valeant), Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Ellex Medical Lasers, Ltd., Lumenis Ltd., Nidek Co. Ltd., Quantel Medical SA, and Topcon Corporation.  We also compete with alternative glaucoma surgical device companies such as Alcon, Allergan, and Glaukos.  Pharmaceuticals represent alternative treatments to our laser procedures.  Some of our principal pharmaceutical competitors are Alcon, Allergan, OSI Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, Regeneron, Roche (Genentech), and Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, engineering, product development, manufacturing, marketing and technical resources than we do. Some companies also have greater name recognition than us and long-standing customer relationships. In addition, other medical companies, academic and research institutions, or others, may develop new technologies or therapies, including medical devices, surgical procedures or pharmacological treatments and obtain regulatory approval for products utilizing such techniques that are more effective in treating the conditions targeted by us, or are less expensive than our current or future products. Our technologies and products could be rendered obsolete by such developments. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Patents and Proprietary Rights
 Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary information. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. These are either developed internally or obtained from acquisitions such as RetinaLabs and Ocunetics. We file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are significant to the development of our business. We have been issued 28 United States patents and 20 foreign patents on the technologies related to our continuing products and processes, which have expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2034. We have 9 pending patent applications in the United States and 18 foreign pending patent applications that have been filed. Our patent applications may not be approved. 
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how which we seek to protect, in part, through proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. Our proprietary information agreements 
 9


with our employees and consultants contain provisions requiring such individuals to assign to us, without additional consideration, any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us, subject to customary exceptions. 
 Government Regulation
 The medical devices marketed and manufactured by us are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities, including federal, state, and foreign governmental agencies. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (“FDA Act”), the FDA serves as the principal federal agency within the United States with authority over medical devices and regulates the research, clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of such devices. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the government to grant pre-market clearance or approval for devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals, and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us. 
 In the United States, medical devices are classified into one of three classes (Class I, II or III). The class to which the device is assigned determines, among other things, the type of pre-marketing submission/application required for FDA clearance to market. If the device is classified as Class I or II, and if it is not exempt, a 510(k) pre-market notification will be required for marketing. Under FDA regulations, Class I devices are subject to general controls (for example, labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to Quality System Regulations (“QSRs”) requirements). Class II devices receive marketing clearance through a 510(k) pre-market notification. For Class III devices, a pre-market approval (“PMA”) application will be required unless the device is a pre-amendments device (on the market prior to the passage of the medical device amendments in 1976, or substantially equivalent to such a device) and PMAs have not been called for. In that case, a 510(k) will be the route to market. A 510(k) clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or II medical device, or to a Class III medical device for which the FDA has not called for a PMA. The FDA may determine that a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device or that additional information or data are needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made. A request for additional data may require that clinical studies of the device’s safety and efficacy be performed. 
 Commercial distribution of a device for which a 510(k) notification is required can begin only after the FDA issues an order finding the device to be substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device. The FDA has recently been requiring a more rigorous demonstration of substantial equivalence than in the past. Even in cases where the FDA grants a 510(k) clearance, it can take the FDA between three and six months from the date of submission to grant a 510(k) clearance, but it may take longer. 
 A not substantially equivalent determination, or a request for additional information, could delay the market introduction of new products that fall into this category and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For any of our products that are cleared through the 510(k) process, modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or efficacy of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require new 510(k) submissions. 
 We have obtained 510(k) clearances for all of our marketed products. We have also modified aspects of our products since receiving regulatory clearance, and we have submitted special 510(k)s for those modifications as required by FDA regulations. After a device receives a 510(k) clearance or a PMA, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until a 510(k) clearance or a PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA clearances or approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the use of the device. Device manufacturers are required to register their establishments and list their devices with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies. The FDA Act requires devices to be manufactured to comply with applicable QSR regulations which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us with respect to design, development, manufacturing and quality assurance activities. We are subject to 
 10


unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services, to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. 
 Labeling and promotion activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and in certain instances, by the Federal Trade Commission. The FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved uses. We and our products are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our products are or will be marketed. Any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our products in those states or localities. Manufacturers are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. Such laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business. 
 Export of our products is regulated by the FDA and is covered by the Export Amendment of 1996, which greatly expanded the export of approved and unapproved United States medical devices. However, some foreign countries require manufacturers to provide an FDA certificate of products for export (“CPE”) which requires the device manufacturer to certify to the FDA that the product has been granted pre-market clearance in the United States and that the manufacturing facilities appeared to be in compliance with QSR at the time of the last QSR inspection. The FDA will refuse to issue a CPE if significant outstanding QSR violations exist. 
 We are also regulated under the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act, which requires laser products to comply with performance standards, including design and operation requirements, and manufacturers to certify in product labeling and in reports to the FDA that their products comply with all such standards. The law also requires laser manufacturers to file new product and annual reports, maintain manufacturing, testing and sales records and report product defects. Various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices installed, depending on the class of the product. 
 The introduction of our products in foreign markets will also subject us to foreign regulatory clearances which may impose substantial additional costs and burdens. International sales of medical devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country. The regulatory review process varies from country to country. Many countries also impose product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions on devices. In addition, each country has its own tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. The approval by the FDA and foreign government authorities is unpredictable and uncertain. The necessary approvals or clearances may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of, or a failure to receive, such approvals or clearances, or the loss of any previously received approvals or clearances, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There are a number of major regulatory changes occurring in the regulation of medical devices in the European Union. A new revision of the quality system regulation (ISO 13485:2016) has been released that substantially increases the requirements for a medical device quality system. The Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) will replace the current medical device directive (93/42/EEC), and it substantially changes the way that medical devices are brought to market in the European Union and how they maintain compliance throughout the product’s life cycle. Additionally, the new revision 4 of the clinical evaluation report guidance document (MEDDEV 2.7.1) severely restricts the use of substantial equivalence for new products, resulting in the need for formal clinical trial data for most new products. These changes will increase the cost for compliance and for product development, and they lengthen product introduction cycles. Failure to comply with these changes can have an adverse effect on our ability to release new products in a timely manner.
 Changes in existing requirements or adoption of new requirements or policies by the FDA or other foreign and domestic regulatory authorities could adversely affect our ability to comply with regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with laws and regulations in the future. These laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Reimbursement 
 The cost of a significant portion of medical care in the United States is funded by government programs, health maintenance organizations and private insurance plans. Our ophthalmology products are typically purchased by doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users, which bill various third-party payers, such as government programs and private insurance plans, for the health care services provided to their patients. Government imposed limits on reimbursement of hospitals and other health care providers have significantly affected the spending budgets of doctors, clinics and hospitals to acquire new equipment, including our products. Under certain government insurance programs, a health care provider is reimbursed for a 
 11


fixed sum for services rendered in treating a patient, regardless of the actual charge for such treatment. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services reimburses hospitals on a prospectively-determined fixed amount basis for the costs associated with an in-patient hospitalization based on the patient’s discharge diagnosis, regardless of the actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in furnishing the care and regardless of the specific devices used in that procedure. 
 Private third-party reimbursement plans are also developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling health-care costs by imposing limitations on reimbursable procedures and the exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering health care. In general, these government and private measures have caused health care providers, including our customers, to be more selective in the purchase of medical products. In addition, changes in government regulation or in private third-party payers’ policies may limit or eliminate reimbursement for procedures employing our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users of our products may not obtain adequate reimbursement for use of our products from third-party payers. While we believe that the laser procedures using our products have generally been reimbursed, payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for our products if they determine that the device was not reasonable and necessary for the purpose used, was investigational or was not cost-effective. 
 Backlog and Seasonality 
 We generally do not maintain a material level of backlog. As a result, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is indicative of future sales levels. Our quarterly results have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by seasonal factors. For example, our European sales during the third quarter are generally lower due to many businesses being closed for the summer vacation season. 
Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we have a total of 121 full-time equivalent employees engaged in our ongoing operations, including 57 in operations (including manufacturing, quality, logistics and service), 30 in sales and marketing which does not include the 12 independent sales representatives, 20 in R&D and 14 in finance and administration. We also employ, from time to time, a number of temporary and part-time employees as well as consultants on a contract basis. As of December 31, 2016, we employed 33 such persons. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate highly qualified employees, who are in great demand. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization, and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike. We consider our employee relations to be good.

tem 1A. Risk Factors 
 Factors That May Affect Future Results 
 In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report Form 10-K, we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, common stock price, financial condition or results of operations. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. 
 12


Risks Relating to our Business
 We face quality control and other production issues that could materially and adversely impact our sales and financial results and the acceptance of our products.
 The manufacture of our infrared and visible laser consoles and related delivery devices is a highly complex and precise process. We assemble critical subassemblies and substantially all of our final products at our facility in Mountain View, California. We may experience manufacturing difficulties, quality control issues or assembly constraints, particularly with regard to new products that we may introduce.
 If our sales increase substantially, we may need to increase our production capacity and may not be able to do so in a timely, effective or cost-efficient manner. We may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products, which may require that we qualify other manufacturers for our products. Furthermore, we may experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations.
 In the recent past, we have experienced supply chain, production and training issues as we have expanded our product lines and sales volumes. For example, in our third quarter of fiscal 2016, we experienced certain supply chain and sales force training issues in certain of our medical retina products. As a result of these issues, we reduced the shipment of these products in that fiscal quarter. In fiscal 2015, we experienced product issues with certain of our products, which caused us to reduce shipments, particularly to international distributors.
 While we have taken steps to address these issues, there is no assurance that these steps will be effective in rectifying or preventing similar issues in the future. If we are unable to address these supply chain, production and training issues in a timely and cost-effective manner, product shipments to our customers could be delayed, our sales levels may suffer and manufacturing and operational costs may increase, any of which would negatively impact our net revenues.
 Some of our laser systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed by our customers, which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues. 
 Laser systems are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance. The manufacture of our lasers, laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process. As a result of the technical complexity of our products, changes in our or our suppliers’ manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability. To the extent that we do not achieve such yields or product reliability, our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected. We provide warranties on certain of our product sales, and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale. The determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of failure rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty. We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs. If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to recognize additional cost of revenues may be required in future periods. 
 Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, which may contain defects. As a result, should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things: 
  
• | loss of customers;
--+-------------------


• | increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | damage to our brand reputation;
--+--------------------------------


• | failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | diversion of development and engineering resources; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | legal actions by our customers.
--+--------------------------------

 The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 13


We depend on international sales for a significant portion of our operating results.
We derive, and expect to continue to derive, a large portion of our revenues from international sales. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, our international sales were $21.0 million, or 45.5% of total revenues. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future. None of our international revenues and costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 have been denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies makes our products more expensive and thus less competitive in foreign markets and may negatively affect our reported revenue in any particular reporting period. Our international operations and sales are subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:
  
• | fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | product and production issues;
--+-------------------------------


• | performance of our international channel of distributors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | longer accounts receivable collection periods;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | impact of recessions in global economies and availability of credit;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | political and economic instability;
--+------------------------------------


• | trade sanctions and embargoes;
--+-------------------------------


• | impact of international conflicts, terrorist and military activity, civil unrest;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | foreign certification requirements, including continued ability to use the “CE” mark in Europe, and other local regulatory requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | differing local product preferences and product requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | cultural differences;
--+----------------------


• | changes in foreign medical reimbursement and coverage policies and programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduced or limited protections of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potentially adverse tax consequences;
--+--------------------------------------


• | protectionist, adverse and changing foreign governmental laws and regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | greater risk of our employees failing to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including anti-trust regulations, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and any trade regulations designed to ensure fair trade practices; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance costs and risks of non-compliance with multiple regulatory regimes governing the production, marketing, sale and use of our products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Any one or more of these factors stated above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 As we expand our existing international operations we may encounter new risks in addition to the above factors. For example, as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions, we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local distributors and trading companies. If we are not successful in developing these relationships, we may not be able to grow sales in these geographic regions. These or other similar risks could adversely affect our revenues, profitability and the price of our common stock.
 We are exposed to risks associated with worldwide economic slowdowns and related uncertainties. 
 We are subject to macro-economic fluctuations in the U.S. and worldwide economy. Concerns about consumer and investor confidence, volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending, international conflicts, terrorist and military activity, civil unrest and pandemic illness could reduce customer orders or cause customer order cancellations. In addition, political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put further pressure on economic conditions in the United States and abroad.
 14


Weak economic conditions and declines in consumer spending and consumption may harm our operating results. Purchases of our products are often discretionary. During uncertain economic times, customers or potential customers may delay, reduce or forego their purchases of our products and services, which may impact our business in a number of ways, including lower prices for our products and services and reducing or delaying sales. There could be a number of follow-on effects from economic uncertainty on our business, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays, delays in customer payments of outstanding accounts receivable and/or customer insolvencies, counterparty failures negatively impacting our operations, and increasing expense or inability to obtain future financing.
 If economic uncertainty persisted, or if the economy entered a prolonged period of decelerating growth, our results of operations may be harmed.
 Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. 
 Our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future. Our operating results are affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors contributing to these fluctuations include the following:
  
• | changes in the prices at which we can sell our products, including the impact of changes in exchange rates;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | general economic uncertainties and political concerns;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | introduction of new products, product enhancements and new applications by our competitors, including new drugs, entry of new competitors into our markets, pricing pressures and other competitive factors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products, product enhancements and new applications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in demand for our existing line of ophthalmology products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the cost and availability of components and subassemblies, including the willingness and ability of our sole or limited source suppliers to timely deliver components at the times and prices that we have planned;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to maintain sales volumes at a level sufficient to cover fixed manufacturing and operating costs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fluctuations in our product mix within ophthalmology products and foreign and domestic sales;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the effect of regulatory approvals and changes in domestic and foreign regulatory requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our long and highly variable sales cycle;
--+------------------------------------------


• | changes in customers’ or potential customers’ budgets as a result of, among other things, reimbursement policies of government programs and private insurers for treatments that use our products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | variances in shipment volumes as a result of product, supply chain and training issues; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increased product innovation costs.
--+------------------------------------

 In addition to these factors, our quarterly results have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by seasonal factors. For example, our European sales during the third quarter are generally lower due to many businesses being closed for the summer vacation season.
 Our expense levels are based, in part, on expected future sales. If sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations, we may be unable to adjust operating expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall of sales, and our results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, we have historically made a significant portion of each quarter’s product shipments near the end of the quarter. If that pattern continues, any delays in shipment of products could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for such quarter. Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our past operating results may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance. Our operating results in future quarters and years may be below expectations, which would likely cause the price of our common stock to fall.
 15


If we fail to develop and successfully introduce new products and applications, our business prospects and operating results may suffer.
 Our ability to generate incremental revenue growth will depend, in part, on the successful outcome of research and development activities, which may include clinical trials that lead to the development of new products and new applications using our products. Our research and development process is expensive, prolonged, and entails considerable uncertainty. Due to the complexities and uncertainties associated with ophthalmic research and development, products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required to market such products successfully.
 Successful commercialization of new products and new applications will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and effectively coordinate with our suppliers. In addition, we must successfully sell and achieve market acceptance of new products and applications and enhanced versions of existing products. The extent of, and rate at which, market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables, which include, among other things, price, safety, efficacy, reliability, marketing and sales efforts, the development of new applications for these products, the availability of third-party reimbursement of procedures using our new products, the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns.
 Our ability to market and sell new products is subject to government regulation, including approval or clearance by the FDA and foreign government agencies. Any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products or enhanced versions of existing products and achieve market acceptance of new products and new applications could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and would cause our net revenues to decline.
 We rely on continued market acceptance of our existing products and any decline in sales of our existing products would adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 We currently market visible and infrared medical laser systems and delivery devices to the ophthalmology market. We believe that continued and increased sales, if any, of these medical laser systems is dependent upon a number of factors including the following: 
  
• | acceptance of product performance, features, ease of use, scalability and durability, including with respect to our MicroPulse laser photocoagulation systems;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recommendations and opinions by ophthalmologists, other clinicians, and their associated opinion leaders;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | marketing study outcomes;
--+--------------------------


• | price of our products and prices of competing products and technologies, particularly in light of the current macro-economic environment where healthcare systems and healthcare operators are becoming increasingly price sensitive;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | availability of competing products, technologies and alternative treatments; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | level of reimbursement for treatments administered with our products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we derive a meaningful portion of our sales in the form of recurring revenues from selling consumable instrumentation, including our EndoProbe devices and service. Our ability to increase recurring revenues from the sale of consumable products will depend primarily upon the features of our current products and product innovation, the quality of our products, ease of use and prices of our products, including the relationship to prices of competing products. The level of our service revenues will depend on the quality of service we provide and the responsiveness and the willingness of our customers to request our services rather than purchase competing products or services. Any significant decline in market acceptance of our products or our revenues derived from the sales of laser consoles, delivery devices, consumables or services may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 We face strong competition in our markets and expect the level of competition to grow in the foreseeable future. 
 Competition in the market for laser systems and delivery devices used for ophthalmic treatment procedures is intense and is expected to increase. This market is also characterized by technological innovation and change. We compete by providing features and services that are valued by our customers such as: enhanced product performance, and clinical outcomes, ease of use, durability, versatility, customer training services and rapid repair of equipment. 
 16


Our principal ophthalmic laser competitors are Alcon Inc. (Novartis AG), Bausch and Lomb (Valeant), Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Ellex Medical Lasers, Ltd., Lumenis Ltd., Nidek Co. Ltd., Quantel Medical SA, and Topcon Corporation.  We also compete with alternative glaucoma surgical device companies such as Alcon, Allergan, and Glaukos.  Pharmaceuticals represent alternative treatments to our laser procedures.  Some of our principal pharmaceutical competitors are Alcon, Allergan, OSI Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, Regeneron, Roche (Genentech), and Valeant Pharmaceuticals.  Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, engineering, product development, manufacturing, marketing and technical resources than we do. Some companies also have greater name recognition than us and long-standing customer relationships. In addition, other medical companies, academic and research institutions, or others, may develop new technologies or therapies, including medical devices, surgical procedures or pharmacological treatments and obtain regulatory approval for products utilizing such techniques that are more effective in treating the conditions targeted by us, or are less expensive than our current or future products. Our technologies and products could be rendered obsolete by such developments. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our operating results may be adversely affected by uncertainty regarding healthcare reform measures and changes in third- party coverage and reimbursement policies. 
 Our products are typically purchased by doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users, which bill various third-party payers, such as governmental programs and private insurance plans, for the health care services provided to their patients. Changes in government legislation or regulation or in private third-party payers’ policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing our products may prohibit adequate reimbursement. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system, reduce the costs of healthcare and change medical reimbursement policies. Doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users of our products may decline to purchase our products to the extent there is uncertainty regarding reimbursement of medical procedures using our products and any healthcare reform measures. Further proposed legislation, regulation and policy changes affecting third-party reimbursement are likely. Among other things, Congress has in the past proposed changes to and the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”). At this time, it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to or any repeal of the Affordable Care Act, with respect to certain of its provisions or in its entirety. Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level.
 We are unable to predict what legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future at the state or federal level, or what effect such legislation or regulation may have on us. Furthermore, existing legislation and regulation related to the health care industry and third-party coverage reimbursement, including the Affordable Care Act, has been subject to judicial challenge, and may be subject to similar challenges from time to time in the future. Denial of coverage and reimbursement of our products, or the revocation or changes to coverage and reimbursement policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Third-party payers are increasingly scrutinizing and continue to challenge the coverage of new products and the level of reimbursement for covered products. Doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users of our products may not obtain adequate reimbursement for use of our products from third-party payers. While we believe that the laser procedures using our products have generally been reimbursed, payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for our products if they determine that the device was not reasonable and necessary for the purpose used, was investigational or was not cost-effective.
 If we fail to comply with healthcare laws, we could face substantial penalties and financial exposure, and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
 While we do not bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, because payment is in many cases available for our products from such payors, many healthcare laws place limitations and requirements on the manner in which we conduct our business (including our sales and promotional activities and interactions with healthcare professionals and facilities) and could result in liability and exposure to us. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, among others: (i) the federal healthcare programs Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, (ii) federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us if we provide coding and billing advice to customers, or under theories of “implied certification” where the government and qui tam relators may allege that device companies are liable where a product that was paid for by the 
 17


government in whole or in part was promoted “off-label,” lacked necessary clearance or approval, or failed to comply with good manufacturing practices or other laws; (iii) transparency laws and related reporting and disclosures requirements such as the federal Sunshine Act, now known as Open Payments; and/or (iv) state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, including, without limitation anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, many of which differ from their federal counterparts in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that their provisions are open to a variety of evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion. Open Payments, commonly known as the Sunshine Act, is a relatively new law, and compliance with this law has presented a number of challenges to companies such as ours, in terms of interpretation of the law and its implementation. Under the Sunshine Act, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has the potential to impose penalties of up to $1.15 million per year for violations, depending on the circumstances, although enforcement has been negligible to date. Payments reported under the Sunshine Act also have the potential to draw scrutiny on payments to and relationships with physicians, which may have implications under the Anti-Kickback Statute and other healthcare laws. The risk that we are our being found in violation of these laws may be increased by the fact that we do not have a formal healthcare compliance program in place. Further, while safe harbors may in some instances be available and utilized by companies to reduce risks associated with the Anti-Kickback Statute and certain other healthcare laws, we have not necessarily utilized such safe harbors nor fully followed all elements required to claim the benefit of such safe harbors in all possible instances. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.
 We depend on collaborative relationships to develop, introduce and market new products, product enhancements and new applications.
 We depend on both clinical and commercial collaborative relationships. We have entered into collaborative relationships with academic medical centers and physicians in connection with the research and innovation and clinical testing of our products. Commercially, we currently have a distribution and licensing agreement with Alcon for our GreenTip SoftTip Cannula. Sales of and royalties from the GreenTip Soft Tip Cannula are dependent upon the sales performance of Alcon, which depends on their efforts and is beyond our control. The failure to obtain any additional future clinical or commercial collaborations and the resulting failure or success of such arrangements of any current or future clinical or commercial collaboration relationships could have a material adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products or applications and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 If we cannot increase our sales volumes, reduce our costs or introduce higher margin products to offset anticipated reductions in the average unit price of our products, our operating results may suffer. 
 
The average unit price of our products may decrease in the future in response to changes in product mix, competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by our competitors or other factors. If we are unable to offset the anticipated decrease in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or through new product introductions, our net revenues will decline. In addition, to maintain our gross margins we must continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products. If we cannot maintain our gross margins our business could be seriously harmed, particularly if the average selling price of our products decreases significantly without a corresponding increase in sales.
 We rely on our direct and independent sales forces and network of international distributors to sell our products and any failure to maintain our sales force and distributor relationships could harm our business.
 Our ability to sell our products and generate revenues depends upon our direct and independent sales forces within the United States and relationships with independent distributors outside the United States. Currently our direct and independent sales forces within the United States consist of approximately 16 employees and 12 independent representatives, respectively. Our international independent distributors are managed by a team of five people. We generally grant our distributors exclusive territories for the sale of our products in specified countries. The amount and timing of resources dedicated by our distributors to the sales of our products is not within our control. Our international sales are entirely dependent on the efforts of these third parties. If any distributor breaches the terms of its distribution agreement with us or fails to generate sales of 
 18


our products, we may be forced to replace the distributor and our ability to sell our products into that exclusive sales territory would be adversely affected.
 We do not have any long-term employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force. We may be unable to replace our direct sales force personnel with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications, which may harm our revenues and our ability to maintain market share. Similarly, our independent and distributor agreements are generally terminable at will by either party and independents and distributors may terminate their relationships with us, which would affect our sales and results of operations.
 Our promotional practices are subject to extensive government scrutiny. We may be subject to governmental, regulatory and other legal proceedings relative to advertising, promotion, and marketing that have a significant negative effect on our business.
 We are subject to governmental oversight and associated civil and criminal enforcement relating to drug and medical device advertising, promotion, and marketing, and such enforcement is evolving and intensifying. In the United States, we are subject to potential enforcement from the FDA, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. Other parties, including private plaintiffs, also are commonly bringing suit against pharmaceutical and medical device companies, alleging off-label marketing and other violations. We may be subject to liability based on the actions of individual employees and contractors carrying out activities on our behalf, including sales representatives who may interact with healthcare professionals.
 If we fail to manage growth effectively, our business could be disrupted which could harm our operating results.
 We have experienced and may in the future experience growth in our business, both organically and through the acquisition of businesses and products. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments to enable our future growth through, among other things, new product innovation and clinical trials for new applications and products. We must also be prepared to expand our work force and to train, motivate and manage additional employees as the need for additional personnel arises. Our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. Any failure to effectively manage future growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 We rely on patents and proprietary rights to protect our intellectual property and business.
 Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary information. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. We file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are significant to the development of our business. We have been issued 28 United States patents and 20 foreign patents on the technologies related to our products and processes. We have 9 pending patent applications in the United States and 18 foreign pending patent applications that have been filed. Our patent applications may not be approved. Any patents granted now or in the future may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and development by our competitors of competing products. Moreover, our competitors, many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products either in the United States or in international markets. Patents have a limited lifetime and once a patent expires competition may increase.
 
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how which we seek to protect, in part, through proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. Our proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants contain industry standard provisions requiring such individuals to assign to us without additional consideration any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us, subject to customary exceptions. Proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants and others may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Also, our trade secrets may become known to or independently developed by competitors.
 
The laser and medical device industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage.
 
19


Numerous patents are held by others, including academic institutions and our competitors. Patent applications filed in the United States after November 2000 generally will be published eighteen months after the filing date. However, since patent applications continue to be maintained in secrecy for at least some period of time, both within the United States and with regards to international patent applications, we cannot assure you that our technology does not infringe any patents or patent applications held by third parties. We have, from time to time, been notified of, or have otherwise been made aware of, claims that we may be infringing upon patents or other proprietary intellectual property owned by others. If it appears necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses under such patents or proprietary intellectual property. Although patent holders commonly offer such licenses, licenses under such patents or intellectual property may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be reasonable.
 Any claims, with or without merit, and regardless of whether we are successful on the merits, would be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, cause shipment delays or require us to develop non-infringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding and failure to obtain necessary licenses or develop alternate technologies could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 If we lose key personnel or fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully, our ability to manage our business could be impaired.
 
Our future success depends upon the continued service of our key management, technical, sales, and other critical personnel. Our officers and other key personnel are employees-at-will, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them. Key personnel have left our company in the past, and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future. The loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives, and the results of our operations. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry and the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as other geographic markets in which we recruit, is intense and characterized by increasing salaries, which may increase our operating expenses or hinder our ability to recruit qualified candidates. In addition, the integration of replacement personnel could be time consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful.
 If we fail to accurately forecast demand for our product and component requirements for the manufacture of our product, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays and may experience lost sales or significant inventory carrying costs.
 We use quarterly and annual forecasts based primarily on our anticipated product orders to plan our manufacturing efforts and determine our requirements for components and materials. It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our product and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials. Lead times for components vary significantly and depend on numerous factors, including the specific supplier, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand for such components. If we overestimate the demand for our product, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs. If we underestimate demand for our product and consequently, our component and materials requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt our manufacturing, delay delivery of our product to our customers and result in the loss of customer sales. Any of these occurrences would negatively impact our business and operating results.
 We depend on sole source or limited source suppliers.
 We rely on third parties to manufacture substantially all of the components used in our products, including optics, laser diodes and crystals. We have some long term or volume purchase agreements with our suppliers and currently purchase components on a purchase order basis. Some of our suppliers and manufacturers are sole or limited sources. In addition, some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies whose operations may be disrupted or discontinued at any time. There are risks associated with the use of independent manufacturers, including the following:
 
 
• | unavailability of shortages or limitations on the ability to obtain supplies of components in the quantities that we require;


• | delays in delivery or failure of suppliers to deliver critical components on the dates we require;

 20



 
• | failure of suppliers to manufacture components to our specifications, and potentially reduced quality; and


• | inability to obtain components at acceptable prices.

 Our business and operating results may suffer from the lack of alternative sources of supply for critical sole and limited source components. The process of qualifying suppliers is complex, requires extensive testing with our products, and may be lengthy, particularly as new products are introduced. New suppliers would have to be educated in our production processes. In addition, the use of alternate components may require design alterations to our products and additional product testing under FDA and relevant foreign regulatory agency guidelines, which may delay sales and increase product costs. Any failures by our vendors to adequately supply limited and sole source components may impair our ability to offer our existing products, delay the submission of new products for regulatory approval and market introduction, materially harm our business and financial condition and cause our stock price to decline. Establishing our own capabilities to manufacture these components would be expensive and could significantly decrease our profit margins. Our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to obtain components in the quantity and quality desired and at the prices we have budgeted.
 If our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss, our operations would be seriously harmed.
 Our facilities could be subject to catastrophic loss such as fire, flood or earthquake. All of our research and development activities, manufacturing, our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in Mountain View, California. Any such loss at any of our facilities could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expense to repair and replace our facilities.
 If we fail to maintain our relationships with health care providers, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline. At the same time, relationships with these individuals and entities are the subject of heightened scrutiny and may present the potential for healthcare compliance risks.
 We market our products to numerous health care providers, including physicians, hospitals, ASC’s, government affiliated groups and group purchasing organizations. We have developed and strive to maintain close relationships with members of each of these groups who assist in product research and development and advise us on how to satisfy the full range of surgeon and patient needs. We rely on these groups to recommend our products to their patients and to other members of their organizations. The failure of our existing products and any new products we may introduce to retain the support of these various groups could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our interactions, communications, and financial relationships with these individuals and entities present potential healthcare compliance risks.
 We are subject to government regulations which may cause us to delay or withdraw the introduction of new products or new applications for our products.
 The medical devices that we market and manufacture are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by foreign and state governments. Under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the related regulations, the FDA regulates the design, development, clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, sale, distribution and promotion of medical devices. Before a new device can be introduced into the market, the product must be shown to meet regulatory requirements established by the FDCA and implemented by the FDA. Unless otherwise exempt, a device manufacturer must obtain marketing “clearance” through the 510(k) premarket notification process, or “approval” through the lengthier premarket approval application (“PMA”) process. Not all devices are eligible for the 510(k) clearance process. Depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the device and the nature of the disease or disorder to be treated, the FDA process can take several years, require extensive clinical testing and result in significant expenditures. Even if regulatory clearance or approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown safety issues may result in restrictions on the product, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Other countries also have extensive regulations regarding clinical trials and testing prior to new product introductions. Our failure to obtain government approvals or any delays in receipt of such approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 The FDA imposes a broad range of additional requirements on medical device companies. Our products must be produced in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) and our manufacturing facilities are subject to establishment registration and device listing requirements from the FDA, and similar requirements from certain state authorities, and ongoing periodic inspections by the FDA, including unannounced inspections for compliance with applicable requirements. We are subject to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting obligations for medical device adverse events and 
 21


malfunctions; notification of our products’ defects or failure to comply with the FDA’s laser regulations; and reporting of recalls, corrections, or removals of our products. The FDA also imposes requirements for the labeling of our products, and places limitations on claims we are permitted to make about our products in promotional labeling. The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over the advertising of all of our products, which are non-restricted devices, and exercises oversight in coordination with the FDA.
 Noncompliance with the applicable requirements can result in, among other things, regulatory citations (including “483 Observations”) and Warning Letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, withdrawal of marketing approvals, and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device we manufacture or distribute. Any of these actions by the FDA would materially and adversely affect our ability to continue operating our business and the results of our operations. Such enforcement action can also result in negative publicity.
 In addition, we are also subject to varying product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. As a result of our sales in Europe, we are required to have all products “CE” marked, an international symbol affixed to all products demonstrating compliance with the European Medical Device Directive and all applicable standards. While currently all of our released products are CE marked, continued certification is based on the successful review of our quality system by our European Registrar during their annual audit. Any loss of certification would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There are a number of major regulatory changes occurring in the regulation of medical devices in the EU. A new revision of the quality system regulation (ISO 13485:2016) has been released that substantially increases the requirements for a medical device quality system. The Medical Device Regulation (MDR) will replace the current medical device directive (93/42/EEC), and it substantially changes the way that medical devices are brought to market in the EU and how they maintain compliance throughout the product’s life cycle. Additionally, the new revision 4 of the clinical evaluation report guidance document (MEDDEV 2.7.1) severely restricts the use of substantial equivalence for new products, resulting in the need for formal clinical trial data for most new products. These changes will increase the cost for compliance and for product development, and they lengthen product introduction cycles. Failure to comply with these changes can have an adverse effect on our ability to release new products in a timely manner.
 If required, clinical trials necessary to support a 510(k) or PMA application will be an expensive, lengthy, costly, and uncertain process, and could result in delays in new product introductions or even an inability to release a product.
 The clinical trials often required to obtain regulatory approvals for products such as ours are complex and expensive and their outcomes are uncertain. If we were to embark upon clinical trials, we would incur substantial expense for, and devote significant time to, these trials but could not be certain that the trials would ever support the commercial sale of a product. We could suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials showed promising results. Any of our products could produce undesirable side effects that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of a product candidate. We, the FDA, or another regulatory authority could suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if they or we believed the trial participants faced unacceptable health risks.
 If we fail to comply with the FDA’s quality system regulation and laser performance standards, our manufacturing operations could be halted, and our business would suffer.
 We are currently required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA’s QSR. The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. Because our products involve the use of lasers, our products also are covered by a performance standard for lasers set forth in FDA regulations. The laser performance standard imposes specific record-keeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements. These requirements include affixing warning labels to laser products, as well as incorporating certain safety features in the design of laser products. The FDA enforces the QSR and laser performance standards through periodic unannounced inspections. We have been, and anticipate in the future being, subject to such inspections. Our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection or our failure to comply with applicable laser performance standards could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of our manufacturing operations, a recall of our products, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions, which would cause our sales and business to suffer.
 22


If we modify one of our FDA approved devices, we may need to submit a new 510(k), or potentially a PMA, and if clearance or approval is not obtained, it would prevent us from selling our modified products or cause us to redesign our products.
 Any modifications to an FDA-cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a PMA. We may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals for new products or for modifications to, or additional indications for, our existing products in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearances would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our revenues and future profitability. We have made modifications to our devices in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA disagrees, and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified devices, which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign our products.
 Our products may be misused, which could harm our reputation and our business.
 We market and sell our products for use by highly skilled physicians with specialized training and experience in the treatment of eye-related disorders. We, and our distributors, generally offer but do not require purchasers or operators of our products to attend training sessions, nor do we supervise the procedures performed with our products. The physicians who operate our products are responsible for their use and the treatment regime for each individual patient. In addition, non-physicians, particularly in countries outside of the United States, or poorly trained or inexperienced physicians, may make use of our products. Our efforts to market our MicroPulse systems as a Fovea-friendly alternative to traditional continuous wavelength systems or alternative treatment methods may result in users failing to implement adequate safety precautions and thereby increase the risks associated with the misuse of our product. The lack of training and the purchase and use of our products by non-physicians or poorly trained or inexperienced physicians may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation, or otherwise cause our business to suffer.
 Inability of customers to obtain credit or material increases in interest rates may harm our sales.
 Some of our products are sold to health care providers in general practice. Many of these health care providers purchase our products with funds they secure through various financing arrangements with third-party financial institutions, including credit facilities and short-term loans. If availability of credit becomes more limited, or interest rates increase, these financing arrangements may be harder to obtain or become more expensive for our customers, which may decrease demand for our products. Any reduction in the sales of our products would cause our business to suffer.
 Our products could be subject to recalls even after receiving FDA approval or clearance. A recall would harm our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.
 The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries in which we market and sell our products have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in the design or manufacture of our products, or in other cases we may determine that we will recall a product because we have determined that the product is violative, in order to avoid further enforcement action and protect the public health. A government mandated recall, or a voluntary recall by us, could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling. A recall could divert management’s attention, cause us to incur significant expenses, harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our future sales.
 If product liability claims are successfully asserted against us, we may incur substantial liabilities that may adversely affect our business or results of operations.
 We may be subject to product liability claims from time to time. Our products are highly complex and some are used to treat extremely delicate eye tissue. We believe we maintain adequate levels of product liability insurance. However, product liability insurance is expensive and we might not be able to obtain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us, if at all. A successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
23


Efforts to acquire additional companies or product lines may divert our managerial resources away from our business operations, and if we complete additional acquisitions, we may incur or assume additional liabilities or experience integration problems.
 Since 1989, we have completed six acquisitions. As part of our growth strategy we seek to acquire businesses or product lines for various reasons, including adding new products, adding new customers, increasing penetration with existing customers, adding new manufacturing capabilities or expanding into new geographic markets. Our ability to successfully grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financings. These efforts could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. If we complete future acquisitions, we may also experience:
 •
difficulties integrating any acquired products into our existing business;
  
• | difficulties in integrating an acquired company’s technologies, services, employees, customers, partners, business operations and administrative and software management systems with ours; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  •delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired products;
  •diversion of our management’s time and attention from other business concerns;
  •adverse customer reaction to the product acquisition; and
  •increases in expenses.
 Any one or more of these factors stated above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, acquisitions could materially impair our operating results by causing us to amortize acquired assets, incur acquisition expenses and add debt.
 We are subject to federal, state and foreign laws governing our business practices which, if violated, could result in substantial penalties. Additionally, challenges to or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to and thus could harm our business.
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires us to track and disclose the source of certain metals used in manufacturing which may stem from minerals (so called “conflict minerals”) which originate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining regions. These metals include tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. These metals are central to the technology industry and are present in some of our products as component parts. In most cases no acceptable alternative material exists which has the necessary properties. It is not possible to determine the source of the metals by analysis but instead a good faith description of the source of the intermediate components and raw materials must be obtained. The components which incorporate those metals may originate from many sources and we purchase fabricated products from manufacturers who may have a long and difficult-to-trace supply chain. As the spot price of these materials varies, producers of the metal intermediates can be expected to change the mix of sources used, and components and assemblies which we buy may have a mix of sources as their origin. We are required to carry out a diligent effort to determine and disclose the source of these materials. There can be no assurance we can obtain this information from intermediate producers who are unwilling or unable to provide this information or further identify their sources of supply or to notify us if these sources change. These metals are subject to price fluctuations and shortages which can affect our ability to obtain the manufactured materials we rely on at favorable terms or from consistent sources. These changes could have an adverse impact on our ability to manufacture and market our devices and products.
 If we fail to comply with environmental requirements, our business, financial condition, operating results and reputation could be adversely affected.
 
Our products and operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the use, storage, handling, exposure to, and disposal of hazardous materials and a large and growing body of international standards which govern the design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use and disposal of our products. We must continually keep abreast of these standards and requirements and integrate compliance to these with the development and regulatory documentation for our products. Failure to meet these standards could limit the ability to market our products in those regions which require compliance to such standards or subject us to fines and penalties. Examples of such standards include laws governing the hazardous material content of our devices and products, such as the European Union (“EU”) Directive 2011/65/EU relating to Restrictions on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances “RoHS Directive, and the EU Directive 2012/19/EU on Waste 
 24


Electrical and Electronic Equipment or “WEEE Directive”. Similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in several other jurisdictions and may be enacted in other regions, including in the United States, and we are, or may in the future be, subject to these laws and regulations.
 Our failure to comply with past, present and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our devices and products, inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties and other sanctions, any of which could harm our business and financial condition. We also expect that our devices and products will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. New environmental laws and regulations will likely result in additional costs and may increase penalties associated with violations or require us to change the content of our devices and products or how they are manufactured, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 Risks Relating to Our Ownership of Our Common Stock
 Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.
 The trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, quarterly variations in our operating results, announcements by us or our competitors of new products or of significant clinical achievements, changes in market valuations of other similar companies in our industry and general market conditions. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the trading price of our common stock fluctuated from a low of $8.80 per share to a high of $16.39 per share. For the fourth fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016, the trading price of our common stock fluctuated from $12.58 per share to a high of $16.26 per share. There can be no assurance that our common stock trading price will not suffer declines. Our common stock may experience an imbalance between supply and demand resulting from low trading volumes and therefore broad market fluctuations could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock regardless of our performance.
 Future sales and issuances of securities could negatively affect our stock price and dilute the ownership interest of our existing investors.
 Future sales or issuances of securities by us could decrease the value of our common stock, dilute stockholders’ voting power and reduce future potential earnings per share. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity-linked securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell additional equity securities, our existing stockholders may be materially diluted. Additionally, new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. We may also issue debt securities, which may impose restrictive covenants on our operations or otherwise adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders.
 Sales or issuances of a substantial amount of securities, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. As of December 31, 2016, we had 11,304,736 shares of common stock outstanding, all of which shares, other than shares held by our directors, our executive officers and certain investment funds affiliated with BlueLine Partners, L.L.C. were, and continue to be, eligible for sale in the public market, subject in some cases to compliance with the requirements of Rule 144, including the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements. Future resales of our common stock by our existing stockholders could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
 As of December 31, 2016, holders of an aggregate of 2,060,688 shares of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our other stockholders. In addition, the shares of common stock subject to outstanding options and restricted stock units under our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan and the shares reserved for future issuance under the Incentive Plan will become eligible for sale in the public markets in the future, subject to certain legal and control limitations.
 We may sell shares or other securities in any offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by existing investors, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by existing investors.
 25


Because we do not intend to pay dividends, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.
 We expect to retain any earnings for use to further develop our business, and do not expect to declare cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of any such dividends in the future depends upon our earnings, financial condition, capital needs and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors, and may be restricted by future agreements with lenders. In addition, our loan facility with Silicon Valley Bank restricts us from paying any dividends or making any other distribution or payment on account of our common stock. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.
 If securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish incorrect or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
 The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our market and our competitors. If no or few securities or industry analysts cover our Company, the trading price for our stock could be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes incorrect or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
 Ownership of our common stock is concentrated among a few investors, which may affect the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. Substantial sales by such investors could cause our stock price to decline.
 Our directors, executive officers, current five percent or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially own a significant portion of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016. Having such a concentration of ownership may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, a majority of our outstanding common stock or control of our board of directors through a proxy solicitation.
 Our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing.
 Our business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds to invest in future growth opportunities. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could seriously harm our business and operating results.
 As a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
 We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. We may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner, particularly if material weaknesses or significant deficiencies persist. As of July 2, 2016, we became an accelerated filer and effective with our Annual Report covering our fiscal year 2016, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 as defined in the Exchange Act. If we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.
 Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which could likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.
 26


Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training of our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, that our internal controls are perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and our stock price could decline.
 Our charter documents, anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, and contractual provisions could delay or prevent an acquisition or sale of our company.
 Our Certificate of Incorporation empowers the board of directors to establish and issue a class of preferred stock, and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of the preferred stock. These provisions give the board of directors the ability to deter, discourage or make more difficult a change in control of our company, even if such a change in control could be deemed in the interest of our stockholders or if such a change in control would provide our stockholders with a substantial premium for their shares over the then-prevailing market price for the common stock. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including the following:
 • allow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;
  • only our board of directors is authorized to fill vacant directorships, including newly created seats;
  • special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our board of directors or by a committee of our board of directors, thus prohibiting a stockholder from calling a special meeting;
  • stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose other business; and
  • stockholders are not permitted to cumulate votes in the election of directors.
 In addition, we are generally subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock or prevent changes in our management.
