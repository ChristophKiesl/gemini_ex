On April 4, 2019, we completed the acquisition of ARRIS International plc (ARRIS) (the Acquisition) in an all-cash transaction with a total purchase price of approximately $7.7 billion, including debt assumed. We acquired ARRIS to drive profitable growth in new markets, shape the future of wired and wireless communications, and be in a position to benefit from key industry trends, including network convergence, fiber and mobility everywhere, 5G, Internet of Things (IoT) and rapidly changing network and technology architectures. The operations of ARRIS are included in our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2019 from the date of the Acquisition, which was April 4, 2019. 
 As of January 1, 2020, we reorganized our internal management and reporting structure as part of the integration of the Acquisition. The reorganization aligned our segments with the markets they serve and changed the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, we are reporting financial performance based on four new operating segments: Broadband Networks (Broadband), Home Networks (Home), Outdoor Wireless Networks (OWN) and Venue and Campus Networks (VCN). All prior period amounts in this report have been recast to reflect these operating segment changes.
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenues were $8.44 billion and our net loss was $(573.4) million, which included goodwill impairment charges of $206.7 million, restructuring costs of $88.4 million and transaction and integration costs of $24.9 million. For further discussion of our current and prior year financial results, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Operating Segments 
 As discussed above, as of January 1, 2020, we reorganized our internal management and reporting structure as part of the integration of the Acquisition. We operate and report based on four operating segments: Broadband, Home, OWN and VCN. 
 The distribution of net revenues among our four segments was as follows:
  
 | Year Ended December 31,
----------+------------------------
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018 | 
Broadband | 34.3 | % | 28.3 | % | 31.7 | %
Home | 28.0 | | 30.4 | | — | 
OWN | 14.7 | | 17.7 | | 32.6 | 
VCN | 23.0 | | 23.6 | | 35.7 | 
Total | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

 Broadband (2020 Net Sales of $2.9 billion)
 Our Broadband segment combines our Network Cable and Connectivity (NCC) and Network and Cloud (N&C) businesses and provides an end-to-end product portfolio serving the telco and cable provider broadband market.

The segment’s offerings include base station antennas, RF filters, tower connectivity, microwave antennas, metro cell products, cabinets, steel, accessories, Spectrum Access System and Comsearch. As our wireless operator customers shift a portion of their 5G capital expenditures from the macro tower to the metro cell, the OWN segment portfolio will strategically help make the transition smooth and cost-effective.
VCN Segment (2020 Net Sales of $1.9 billion) 
 Our VCN segment targets both public and private networks for campuses, venues, data centers, and buildings and includes our Ruckus Networks, Enterprise and Distributed Coverage and Capacity Systems (DCCS) businesses. The segment combines Wi-Fi and switching, distributed antenna systems, licensed and unlicensed small cells, and enterprise fiber and copper infrastructure.
Industry Background
 We participate in the large and growing global market for connectivity and essential communications infrastructure. This market is being driven by the growth in bandwidth demand associated with the continued demand of smartphones, tablets and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication as well as the proliferation of data centers, Big Data, cloud-based services, streaming media content and IoT. In addition, video distribution over the broadband IP network is transforming how content is managed and consumed. IP facilitates new forms of video such as Over-the-Top (OTT) and interactive television. Throughout 2020 due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we learned even more about business and consumer reliance on their network connectivity, as our products and services allowed a dramatic shift from working in offices to working in the home. We expect that as the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic we will continue to see a mix of connectivity needs in homes, offices and while on the move. As part of the shift in how people are using the network, we have seen more dramatic upticks in upstream usage than downstream usage. Some of this will subside as people work less from home, but some recent network usage trends will also become the new normal, requiring networks to be more symmetrical than in the past.
 There are several major trends that we expect to drive network deployments and investment, including:
 Evolving Network Architecture and Technology
 The pace of change in networking has increased as consumers and data-driven businesses utilize more bandwidth and shift toward cloud and mobile applications. Exponential growth in video and mobile data consumption are revolutionizing how we connect to each other and changing the network architecture needed to support consumer demand. This trend requires better network coverage, greater broadband access, and increased capacity and data storage. 
 Our customers are working to transition their networks to become faster, more responsive and more efficient. The work from home trend caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated many of these network trends. We believe the following key network trends will continue to impact CommScope and the industry during 2021 and beyond:
  
1) | Network Convergence: Operators are moving toward converged or multi-use network architectures. Rather than building upon independent wireline and wireless networks, operators are now shifting toward networks that combine voice, video and data communications into a single converged data network for wired and wireless services. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Continued Disruption by Over-the-Top TV: Although content consumption continues to increase, subscriptions to pay TV are declining. As a result, cable operators are compelled to invest in and upgrade their networks and expand their video, voice, data and mobile services to deliver higher data rates in both the uplink and downlink on their network. While past data trends have been defined by rapid growth in the downlink, IoT will drive the need for major network change in the uplink.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5
 

 
3) | Densification: As wireless operators work to meet consumer demand, cell splitting, in the form of densification is expected to be a key driver for fulfilling the promise of 5G networks. Increased sectorization at macro cell sites and establishing better inbuilding coverage will also play significant roles in the 5G network. We expect that densification will require significant fiber cable and connectivity between wireless cell sites. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | Virtualization, Centralization and Disaggregation: Operators are virtualizing and centralizing their networks to make them more flexible and efficient. Wireless operators are deploying centralized radio access networks (CRAN) as a first step in the evolution to a virtualized radio access network. Eventually this will enable servers and switches to replace some of the hardware specific equipment that exists today and allow much of the processing to be performed on general purpose processors wherever and whenever it is needed throughout the network. Cable operators are also seeking to virtualize their networks by moving from a traditional converged cable access platform (CCAP) architecture to a distributed access architecture (DAA). This moves some of the processing from the head end to the node and virtualizes the rest on traditional switches and servers. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Transition to 5G
 5G wireless is evolving from an industry vision toward a tangible, next generation wireless technology. Many operators have begun a transition to 5G networks. The number of 5G-enabled devices is expected to continue to increase during 2021. The primary benefits of 5G are expected to include:
  
• | Enhanced mobile broadband—to support significant improvement in data rates and user experience in both the uplink and downlink,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IoT communications to support the expected billions of connections between machines as well as short bursts of information to other systems, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low latency, high-reliability—to support applications that are critical or are needed in real time, like factory machines, virtual reality and augmentation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Wireless operators will need to both acquire and launch new spectrum for 5G, as well as continue their strategy of re-allocation of spectrum from one generation to another. Some of this spectrum will be at much higher frequencies and will use new technologies to deliver exceptional amounts of bandwidth to subscribers. 5G also requires significant fiber infrastructure to connect wireless access points to each other to improve the response time of the network. As wireless operators transition toward 5G, they must also manage the fundamental network deployment issues of site acquisition, power, backhaul and in-building wireless proliferation.
 In addition to investment required by wireless operators, the transition to 5G could also spark an investment cycle by cable operators as they upgrade their networks to compete with fixed wireless broadband, which could become a viable alternative to traditional broadband internet access. 
 Fiber Deep Deployments 
 Residential and business bandwidth consumption continues to grow substantially. The proliferation of OTT video, multiscreen viewing, cloud services and social media are prompting operators to accelerate fiber deployment. Operators can increase network capacity by installing fiber deeper into their networks. Although consumer devices are increasingly connected to the network via a wireless connection such as LTE or Wi-Fi, these wireless access points must have abundant backhaul capacity available to provide consumers the experience they expect. Operators around the globe are deploying fiber deep to build next generation networks. These networks use the capabilities of fiber to enable consumers access to content at higher speeds with improved network response time.
 As networks improve and deliver higher speed and greater reliability, many operators are choosing to provide both residential and business services over a common physical layer infrastructure, saving them time and money. In addition, with the deployments of metro cells, outdoor small cells and fixed wireless broadband to the home, these same service providers are planning to utilize this common physical layer infrastructure to provide connectivity to these wireless access points.

Shift in Enterprise Spending
 Several trends in the enterprise market are expected to create opportunities and challenges for us. First, the shift toward mobility in business enterprises is expected to impact the amount and type of structured copper connectivity needed over the longer-term. As the bandwidth requirements for Wi-Fi, indoor cellular networks (private and public), and IoT devices increase, more access points will be needed throughout commercial buildings. As a result, enterprises are expected to adjust in-building cabling designs to deliver both power and high-speed data to those devices. Power-over-ethernet is expected to become increasingly important as the number of devices used for Wi-Fi and indoor cellular networks multiplies. While enterprises continue to need copper connectivity to power edge devices, enterprises are deploying fiber more extensively in data centers. Over the next several years, we expect the growing demand for fiber and Wi-Fi solutions to result in decelerating demand for copper solutions in networks. 
 Due to huge increases in data traffic and migration of applications to the cloud, enterprises are also shifting spending toward multi-tenant (co-located) data centers and hyperscale cloud service providers, which offer cloud data center services as a replacement for in-house corporate data centers. Multi-tenant and hyperscale data center managers are focused on ultra-low loss, high density, scalable fiber connectivity solutions.
 Enterprises are also looking at using LTE and 5G for their own, private uses. It is expected that private networks will become far more important to an enterprise’s information technology plans and will provide a level of reliable connection that they have not been able to get from their Wi-Fi networks, further moving the demand of enterprise communications into the wireless domain.
 Metro Cell, DAS and Small Cell Investment to Enhance and Expand Wireless Coverage and Capacity
 As demand growth continues to outpace macro cell capacity growth, new solutions are required for densely populated areas. Metro cells and indoor networks have emerged as important layers of the network. Metro cells are smaller outdoor cell sites, located closer to the ground, having a lower power level than traditional macro cell sites. Metro cells blend into their environment and are often found integrated with traditional street furniture, which helps alleviate zoning restrictions that have made traditional deployments difficult. 
 Small cell and DAS solutions address the capacity and speed requirements from an indoor perspective. These systems provide coverage and capacity to the indoor environment and reduce the load from the macro and metro layers, which improves overall network performance. Small cell and DAS systems may range from small single operator, single-band, low-capacity systems for use in enterprise buildings to large multi-carrier, multi-technology, multi-band systems for use in high capacity public venues.
 Transition to Wi-Fi 6
Wi-Fi 6 is the next generation standard in Wi-Fi technology that builds on and improves the current Wi-Fi standard. Until this point, all upgrades to Wi-Fi have been less than a gigabit, but Wi-Fi 6 breaks through this boundary and will likely drive the upgrade of not only the access point but also the switch and cabling systems. Moreover, regulatory efforts are underway to free up the necessary spectrum in the 6GHz band which will enable many more use cases and, in combination with Wi-Fi 6, untether a whole host of equipment.

Strategy
 With the global rise in demand for consumer, business and device connectivity, we expect the need and reliance on communications networks to increase dramatically over the next ten years. Our strategy and 2021 priorities are to: 
Continue Our Organizational Transformation
 To support our goal of shaping the most advanced networks of the future, in January 2020, we realigned our operating and management structure to center around the markets we serve. Based on this new operating and management structure, our new segments are Broadband, Home, OWN and VCN. We are positioned as a leader in each of these areas already and will endeavor to defend our leadership in the more mature parts of these markets, while also shifting resources towards our targeted growth choices within them. We believe this realignment will not only improve the execution of our strategy and help unlock the full potential of our portfolio of end-to-end networking equipment, but it will also help us take advantage of greater revenue and cost synergy potential within our current businesses to achieve the following: 

• | Further improve our market leadership positions;

Products from our Home segment are primarily sold directly to wireline network service providers, such as telephone companies and cable television network providers, to be deployed by them into their subscribers’ homes and businesses. We sell some products to satellite video distributors who also deploy our products into their subscribers’ premises. In some cases, we sell through specialized resellers and distributors who primarily provide logistics support and, in certain circumstances, post-sale service and support. Our customer service and engineering groups maintain close working relationships with these customers due to the significant amount of customization associated with some of these products. We sell these products to most of the wireline and satellite operators globally. In the U.S., we also sell certain products directly to consumers over the internet and through brick and mortar retailers.
 Products from our OWN segment are primarily sold directly to wireless operators, OEMs that sell equipment to wireless operators and other service providers that deploy elements of wireless networks at the direction of wireless operators. Our customer service and engineering groups maintain close working relationships with these customers due to the significant amount of customization associated with some of these products. Although we sell to most wireless operators globally, we are dependent on a small number of large operators.
 Products from our VCN segment are primarily sold through independent distributors or system integrators for large telecommunications operators and to customers in a broad range of enterprise vertical markets, including hospitality, education, smart cities, government, venues and service providers indirectly through channel partners. We also sell directly to cable television system operators, broadband operators and service providers that deploy broadband networks. In certain circumstances, we do sell VCN segment products directly to end customers, but it is a relatively small part of the overall business.
 We generally have no minimum purchase commitments from any of our distributors, system integrators, channel partners, value-added resellers, wireless operators or OEM customers, and our contracts with these parties generally do not prohibit them from purchasing from our competitors or offering products or services that compete with ours. Although we maintain long-term relationships with these parties and have not historically lost key customers, we have experienced significant variability in the level of purchases by our key customers. Any significant reduction in sales to these customers, including as a result of the inability or unwillingness of these customers to continue purchasing our products, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”

Raw Materials and Components
 Our products are manufactured or assembled from both standard components and parts that are unique to our specifications. Our internal manufacturing operations are largely process oriented and we use significant quantities of various raw materials, including aluminum, bimetals, brass, copper, plastics and other polymers, optical fiber and steel, among others. We use significant volumes of copper, aluminum, steel and polymers in manufacturing coaxial and twisted pair cables and antennas. Other parts are produced using processes such as stamping, machining, molding and pressing from metals or plastics. Portions of the requirements for these materials are purchased under supply arrangements where some portion of the unit pricing may be indexed to commodity market prices for these metals. We may occasionally enter forward purchase commitments or otherwise secure availability for specific commodities to mitigate our exposure to price changes for a portion of our anticipated purchases. Certain of the raw materials utilized in our products may only be available from a few suppliers, and we may enter into longer term agreements to secure access to certain key inputs. We may, therefore, encounter availability issues and/or significant price increases.
 Our profitability may be materially affected by changes in the market price of our raw materials, most of which are linked to the commodity markets. Prices for aluminum, copper, plastics and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have fluctuated substantially during the past several years. We have adjusted our prices for certain products and may have to adjust prices again. Delays in implementing price increases, failure to achieve market acceptance of price increases, or price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs, could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations.
 In addition, some of our products are assembled from specialized components and subassemblies manufactured by third-party suppliers. We depend upon sole suppliers for certain of these components, including memory and chip capacitors. If these sources cannot provide these components in sufficient quantity and quality on a timely and cost-efficient basis, it could materially impact our results of operations until another qualified supplier is found. We believe that our supply contracts and our supplier contingency plans mitigate some of this risk. Our supply agreements include technology licensing and component purchase contracts. Several of our competitors have similar supply agreements for these components. In addition, we license software for operating network and security systems or sub-systems and a variety of routing protocols from different suppliers.
 Research and Development
 We operate in an industry that is subject to rapid changes in technology, and our success is largely contingent upon anticipating and reacting to such changes. Accordingly, R&D is important to preserve and expand our position as a market leader and to provide the most technologically advanced solutions in the marketplace. We invested $703.3 million in research and development during 2020, and we expect to continue with substantial investments in future years. We intend to focus our major R&D activities on high-growth opportunities such as fiber optic connectivity for fiber-to-the-x (FTTX) and data centers, Wi-Fi 6 and 6GHz, CCAP, DAA, Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) 4.0, gigabit passive optical network (GPON), active and passive base-station antennas and metro cell and small cell wireless solutions. We are also developing solutions that support the convergence of wireline and wireless networks in connection with the rollout of 5G. Several of our professionals are leaders and active contributors in standards-setting organizations, which helps ensure that our products can be formulated to achieve broad market acceptance. 
Backlog and Seasonality
 At December 31, 2020 and 2019 we had an order backlog of $1,964.3 million and $1,243.2 million, respectively. Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions. Our backlog includes only orders that are believed to be firm. Sometimes, unfilled orders may be canceled prior to shipment of goods, but cancellations historically have not been material. However, our current order backlog may not guarantee future demand.

Due to the variability of shipments under large contracts, customers’ seasonal installation considerations and variations in product mix and in profitability of individual orders, we can experience significant quarterly fluctuations in sales and operating income. Our operating performance is typically weaker during the first and fourth quarters and stronger during the second and third quarters. These variations are expected to continue in the future. It may be more meaningful to focus on annual rather than interim results.
 Patents and Trademarks
 We pursue an active policy of seeking intellectual property protection, including patents and registered trademarks, for new products and designs. For technology that is not owned by us, we have a program for obtaining appropriate licenses to ensure that we have the necessary license coverage for our products. In addition, we have formed strategic relationships with leading technology companies to provide us with early access to technology that we believe will help keep us at the forefront of our industry. 
 On a worldwide basis, we held approximately 15,000 patents and patent applications and approximately 3,000 registered trademarks and trademark applications. We consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, and although no single patent is material to our overall operations, we believe the COMMSCOPE, ARRIS, SURFBOARD, RUCKUS, SYSTIMAX, NETCONNECT, ERA, ONECELL and HELIAX trade names and related trademarks are critical assets to our business. We intend to rely on our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary knowledge, trade secrets and continuing technological innovation, to develop and maintain our competitive position. From time to time there are disputes with respect to the ownership of the technology used in our industry and accusations of patent infringements. We will continue to protect our key intellectual property rights.
 Government Regulation
 We are subject to various domestic and international government regulations. For example, our international operations expose us to increased challenges in complying with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various other international jurisdictions. We are also subject to governmental export and import regulations and sanctions programs that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets. In addition, because of the nature of information that may pass through or is stored on our solutions or networks, we and our end customers may be subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and other matters. Further, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, substances used in our products, discharges to air and water, management of regulated materials, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and investigation and remediation of contaminated sites. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional discussion of our risks related to government laws and regulations.
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability 
 We believe that corporate responsibility and sustainability means making decisions that have a positive impact on our people, planet and bottom line. Our company-wide sustainability mission is to enable faster, smarter and more sustainable solutions while demonstrating the utmost respect for our human and natural resources. We are accomplishing this mission by utilizing innovative technology, intelligent engineering and energy efficient design to build more sustainable networks that make our customers more agile, while at the same time seeking to preserve the natural ecosystems from which we source our raw materials. While we may provide technological solutions, it is our people who make the real difference in our communities. Their commitment to our customers, fellow employees and the communities in which they live and work drives them to provide creative solutions, services and practices that are safe and sustainable for our environment and future generations. 
 We understand how important it is to consider the larger impact of our actions beyond the balance sheet. We are proud of CommScope’s prominent standing in one of the world’s most vital and dynamic industries. We push ourselves and our thinking for the purpose of creating a better and sustainable tomorrow. For the sake of our current and future generations, we will continue to grow as a sustainable, environmentally conscious business that benefits the whole planet.

 Human Capital Management
 Our employees are at the center of everything we do at CommScope, and we understand they are the driving force for our innovation and success. CommScope works to ensure it provides a safe, inclusive, and enjoyable workplace environment for all its employees. We have a global team of nearly 30,000 employees with approximately 60% classified as manufacturing employees. The majority of these manufacturing employees are located in low-cost labor countries such as Mexico, China, India and the Czech Republic. Our U.S. workforce is a mix of manufacturing and non-manufacturing employees and makes up approximately 20% of our employee base. 
 More than ever, our employees have united behind our common purpose to “Create Lasting Connections” all over the world. We unite, collaborate and innovate to create the world’s most advanced networks and succeed by having people who come to work passionate about delivering on this vision every day. Core pillars underlying our Human Capital Management strategy focus on employee engagement, employee training and development, employee inclusion, equality, and diversity, and employee health, safety and well-being. 
 Employee Engagement
 CommScope prides itself on creating a culture where feedback and communication are vital in building an engaging, employee-centric organization. To that end, twice-yearly, around May and November, we “take the pulse” of our organization through a global engagement survey. This Pulse Survey obtains the voice of our employees worldwide and identifies strengths and development areas in our culture as well as management effectiveness. Strong results have shown up consistently over the last year in areas such as engagement, teamwork and collaboration, pride in working for CommScope as well as the strategic clarity of the business. CommScope plans to continue to build out the total employee experience for our employees, in line with our purpose, vision and corporate values.
Employee Education, Training and Development
 We are committed to developing the careers and capabilities of our current and future employees. We have an Early Career Strategy aimed at recruiting people for internships and co-ops, ensuring we are hiring the top early career talent where and when they’re needed. Once hired, our career development and learning philosophy is based on the belief that employees learn best through a combination of work experience, coaching, feedback, training and education. 
 We use an online platform, TalentConnections, to manage permanent employees’ performance and goals throughout the year, providing continuous development opportunities through coaching and feedback. The Global LearnCenter (GLC) is CommScope’s online learning platform consisting of a wealth of work-related development topics, including product knowledge, leadership development, project management, general business content as well as ethics and diversity training. Growth is not only achieved through these learning platforms but also through our regular town halls, round tables and everyday interaction with our front-line managers. We focus heavily on interacting with our employees how, when and where it matters most. 
 Employee Inclusion, Equality, and Diversity
 CommScope strives to create an inclusive environment that draws upon the strength of the diversity within our workforce to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers, employees and stockholders. CommScope’s global workforce comprises individuals of many races, cultures, backgrounds, geographies and experiences. That’s something we take pride in and work constantly to support. We know diversity makes us stronger and helps to further grow our company and create fully inclusive teams. CommScope launched a global Diversity & Inclusion Business Network in June 2020, providing employees with opportunities to network, learn and lead, grow their careers and support their communities. We not only focus on diversity but also equality in the workplace.

CommScope regularly benchmarks its compensation and benefits by country with companies comparable in size and scope to enable competitive and equitable pay. As part of our ongoing process, we work to ensure employees are paid equitably, regardless of gender, nationality or disability. We base pay on the job being performed, employee experience and performance. 
 Employee Health, Safety and Well-being
 At CommScope, our employees’ health, safety and well-being are our top priority. In 2020 this has come more into focus than ever with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In response, we have implemented rigorous health and safety protocols globally. Overall, our vision is to seek opportunities to protect the well-being of our employees, customers, suppliers, environment and communities. 
 A commitment to business practices that are innovative, safe and sustainable is key to our company’s success. To achieve this, we have established a robust Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) management system, set objectives and targets, provided necessary resources and created a comprehensive well-being and benefits program. All this encourages ongoing improvement as we continue to unlock the greatest potential for our employees. The global EHS team has designed and implemented an integrated, companywide EHS management system based on the requirements of the International Standards of ISO45001 and ISO14001. 
 CommScope seeks to inspire a culture of proactive health where our employees make lifestyle decisions that lead to enjoyable careers and balanced lives. To realize this goal, we support our workforce by providing tools, services and programs that help our employees achieve and maintain optimal personal health. We made a commitment in our benefits program to ensure we provide our employees and their family members with a compelling and competitive benefits package that offers value, choices and resources to help manage their well-being, including our GuidanceResources program, which provides physical, emotional, legal and financial well-being resources to employees.
