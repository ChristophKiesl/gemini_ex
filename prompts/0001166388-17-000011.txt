Company Background
We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1994 and completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in May 2002. Over the last two decades, we have grown our revenue and expanded our portfolio of Actionable Intelligence solutions through a combination of organic innovation and acquisitions. 
Our Actionable Intelligence solutions initially focused on the capture of unstructured data, mainly speech data. Over time, we added capabilities for video, text, and other data types and sources, including the web, social media, and machine data. As the company has grown and achieved scale, we have built domain expertise in two areas: customer engagement and cyber intelligence. These areas have driven the evolution of our focus on Actionable Intelligence solutions.
The two operating segments we have today are Customer Engagement Solutions (“Customer Engagement”) and Cyber Intelligence Solutions (“Cyber Intelligence”). Each operating segment has dedicated management teams, sales and marketing, customer service, and research and development resources with shared back-office services. 
Our two operating segments are described in greater detail below and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under Item 7 of this report.

Our Actionable Intelligence Strategy
1

To address the need for Actionable Intelligence across many use cases in customer engagement and cyber intelligence, we developed an innovative foundation—Verint’s advanced Actionable Intelligence platform. We define our platform as having the following four components:

• | Data Capture—Our Actionable Intelligence platform enables the capture of a wide range of data, including both structured and unstructured data, such as operational, transactional, network, and web data. Our platform is designed to support big data applications which depend on the ability to capture, store, and manage very large data sets from multiple data sources. 


• | Data Processing—Our Actionable Intelligence platform facilitates the process of taking structured and unstructured data from multiples sources and then cleansing, fusing, and preparing the data for analysis. This data processing stage is particularly important in applications that require data capture and fusion from multiple sources, different systems, and numerous environments. 


• | Data Analysis—Our Actionable Intelligence platform enables the use of a wide range of engines for data analytics, including classification, correlation, anomaly detection, identity extraction, behavioral analysis, and predictive analytics. Big data analysis is a crucial step in identifying critical insights that otherwise might not be intuitive. 


• | Data Visualization—Our Actionable Intelligence platform facilitates the presentation of crucial insights from data to decision makers and the provision of workflow, collaboration, and case management capabilities so they can make more timely and informed decisions. The platform supports many use cases, and the type of data visualization used for delivering actionable insights to users can be optimized based on the specific user environment. 

Our strategy is to continue to leverage our Actionable Intelligence platform as a foundation for new analytical solutions to address specific use cases for Customer Engagement and Cyber Intelligence. As noted above, our two operating segments have dedicated domain experts and operational functions focused on understanding the specific requirements of their respective markets and customers, and develop leading Actionable Intelligence solutions that can effectively address the unique needs of their customers. 
Customer Engagement Solutions
Overview
Verint is a leading provider of Customer Engagement software and services that can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud. Our solutions help customer-centric organizations optimize customer engagement, increase customer loyalty, and maximize revenue opportunities, while generating operational efficiencies, reducing cost, and mitigating risk. We offer solutions that help organizations empower their customers and employees through intelligence that can be shared enterprise-wide. As a result, organizations are better informed and have greater automation and agility to engage with customers in a highly effective, consistent way. Empowered employees can provide customers with the high-quality, contextual experiences they expect, while generating significant operational efficiencies at the same time. We deploy our solutions globally in a wide range of industries and across an organization’s contact centers, branch and back-office operations, customer experience teams, and digital marketing initiatives. Our Customer Engagement vision is powered by our Actionable Intelligence platform to generate intelligence from structured and unstructured data. 
Trends
We believe the key trends driving demand for solutions that optimize Customer Engagement include:

• | Evolving Customer Expectations. Consumers expect a more personalized, contextual, and consistent customer experience across service channels. Customer service has evolved from traditional call centers and in-store visits, to omnichannel contact centers, or customer engagement centers, that include self-service channels, such as web, voice and mobile self-service, and customer communities; a host of digital communications mediums, such as email, chat, and social media; and the traditional telephone. Today, consumers may select a service channel based on a number of factors, including which channels are available, their experiences with those channels, personal preference, and the type of service issue at hand. Often they use multiple channels for the same service-related issue, and alternate between traditional (voice) and digital (web, social, and mobile) channels based on individual preferences. With multiple engagement channels available and consumers having a preference to have their needs addressed in the first contact, we believe a focus on “ease of doing business” with an organization is becoming increasingly important and can be a key competitive differentiator. 

2

Forward-looking organizations are evolving their customer engagement operations to meet or exceed their customers’ expectations, and we believe that Customer Engagement solutions, such as those from Verint, can play an important role in achieving this goal.

• | Evolving Employee Expectations. Employee expectations are also evolving. Employees want their voices to be heard and their opinions to be taken into account. They want their skills and preferences to be considered and acted upon, and they want to be able to do the right things for their customers. Studies from the industry analyst community have reinforced the impact and importance of an engaged and empowered workforce, finding that when it comes to serving customers, happier, more empowered employees can have a significant impact not only on the customer experience, but also on a company’s financial performance. We believe an engaged and empowered employee base can be a significant differentiator for organizations. Customer Engagement solutions, such as those from Verint, can play an important role in helping empower and develop employees, as well as solicit, analyze, and act on their opinions and feedback. 


• | Evolving Customer-Centric Organizations. Customer-centric organizations are increasingly looking to aggregate, analyze, and act on information to improve the customer experience, build customer loyalty, and drive profitability. Today’s organizations have a significant amount of structured and unstructured data related to their customers, workforce, and other information that is generated from numerous departments and multiple systems across the enterprise. We believe that these organizations are increasingly seeking customer engagement solutions that allow them to collect and analyze intelligence across multiple engagement channels to gain a better understanding of the performance of their workforces, the effectiveness of their service processes, the quality of their interactions, and changing customer behaviors. When captured, analyzed, and acted upon, organizations can use this Actionable Intelligence to help achieve important strategic objectives, such as empowering staff, enhancing loyalty, gaining a holistic view of operations and effectiveness, driving automation, reducing operational costs, increasing revenue, and mitigating risk. 


• | Evolving Requirements for Authentication, Fraud Detection, Risk Management, and Compliance. Organizations face significant challenges when it comes to safeguarding customers’ personal information, investigating fraud, and complying with regulatory and compliance requirements. Many of these risks are fueled by new system vulnerabilities, insider threats, and the rise of sophisticated methods of cyber-attack. For example, in financial services, contact center fraud has driven demand for voice biometrics and predictive analytics solutions that can identify and thwart fraudsters, while quickly authenticating legitimate customers. In financial services, branch and ATM fraud has driven demand for surveillance and analytics tools to support fraud investigations. Financial protection and other regulations—such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard—also present tremendous challenges, with the risk of significant financial penalties and remediation efforts for non-compliance. While organizations often have detailed processes/procedures for employees to follow, we believe that many are increasingly seeking Actionable Intelligence to anticipate and prevent breaches, effectively authenticate customers and protect personal information, mitigate risk, investigate and prevent fraud, and help ensure compliance. 


• | Adopting Innovative Technology. We see several trends in the Customer Engagement market resulting from the availability of new technologies. With the evolution of cloud technologies, some customers expect deployment flexibility, such as the ability to deploy solutions on-premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid fashion. We see greater adoption of cloud solutions in smaller organizations and greater interest in hybrid deployments in larger enterprises. With the evolution of artificial intelligence technologies, we also see interest in greater automation, such as next-generation self-service solutions based on advanced natural language processing and robotic automation. Interest in these solutions is being driven by a desire to reduce the cost of delivering customer service, while at the same time improving customer retention through a faster and high quality self-service experience. Finally, with the evolution of social media, mobile, and other interaction technologies, we see organizations interested in leveraging newer engagement channels to address rapidly-evolving customer preferences. 

Strategy
Our strategy is to further enhance our position as a global leader, enabling organizations to partner with Verint to evolve their customer engagement operations based on a holistic approach that includes deep domain expertise and deployment flexibility, as well as a rich portfolio of best-of-breed solutions. Our strategy pillars include:

• | Offering the Broadest and Most Innovative Portfolio of Best-of-Breed Customer Engagement Solutions. Verint strives to offer the broadest and most innovative portfolio of purpose-built software and supporting services that enhance operational efficiency, reduce cost, improve the customer experience, and drive revenue for contact centers, branch and back office operations, customer experience, and digital marketing. We continue to invest to further expand our portfolio of Customer Engagement solutions.

• | Offering a Holistic Approach to Customer Engagement with the Flexibility to Start Anywhere. Customer-centric organizations are seeking to evolve their customer engagement operations to address the trends outlined above. Organizations are migrating towards a more holistic approach at different paces, depending on their prior investments, business priorities, and current budgets. Verint’s strategy is to offer our broad portfolio in a highly modular fashion that allows customers to preserve their investments in legacy solutions and start anywhere within the Verint portfolio for maximum flexibility. Many of our customers start with the solution that addresses their most urgent needs, and over time, adopt more solutions from our portfolio. 


• | Offering On-Premises, Cloud, and Hybrid Deployment Models with a Broad Range of Value-Added Services.

We believe that customers today are looking for flexible cloud deployment options. To address their varying needs, our Customer Engagement Optimization portfolio has been cloud-enabled, providing customers the ability to deploy our solutions in the way that best meets their objectives, including on-premises, in a private cloud, in a public cloud, or in a hybrid fashion with some solutions deployed on-premises and some in the cloud. In addition, to enable our customers to gain maximum value from our solutions regardless of deployment mode, we offer a broad range of services, including implementation services, consulting services, technical services, and managed services. 

• | Partnering With Customer-Centric Organizations to Address Evolving Trends. We believe that organizations are looking for strategic partners with a broad portfolio and deep domain expertise to help them evolve their customer engagement operations to achieve strategic business goals. Historically, voice/telephony was the dominating channel. Organizations are now looking to add a variety of digital engagement channels (such as web, social, and mobile), as well as assisted service and self-service capabilities. They are also looking to add analytics, automation, and intelligence to power a consistent, contextual, and personalized customer engagement, while reducing operating cost and increasing revenue. To address this opportunity, Verint’s strategy has been to build a broad portfolio of analytics-driven Customer Engagement solutions that enable organizations to implement a holistic approach to customer engagement with greater automation and shared intelligence across applications. We partner with customer-centric organizations to help them protect their legacy investments, while adding new capabilities based on their specific business priorities.

8

Whether consumers choose to engage with humans (e.g., contact center agents and branch tellers) or machines (e.g., self-service voice response, or ATM machines), they expect safe, secure interactions.  At the same time, organizations are looking to minimize and investigate fraud, heighten security and safety for customers and employees, and comply with applicable rules and regulations. 
Verint solutions help fraud mitigation and investigation as part of an organization’s customer engagement strategy. For example, banking customers use our video and transaction analytics tools to investigate fraud in branch banking. Our voice biometrics software is used to authenticate customers in the voice channel to mitigate fraud, and our analytics solutions are used to identify fraudulent transactions in self-service channels. Verint solutions also help emergency response centers (e.g., 911) ensure quality and timeliness of response, and effectively dispatch first responders. 
We provide many security and compliance capabilities embedded in our Customer Engagement Optimization portfolio. These include the encryption of voice recording for maximum data security, compliance that supports the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard in the contact center, and voice/data capture and analytics for trading compliance and other mandates.  Our Security, Fraud, and Compliance solutions include the following:

Cyber Intelligence Solutions
Overview
Verint is a leading provider of security and intelligence data mining software. Our solutions are used for a wide range of applications, including predictive intelligence, advanced and complex investigations, security threat analysis, and electronic data and physical assets protection, as well as for generating legal evidence and preventing criminal activity and terrorism. We deploy our solutions, including software, hardware, and services, globally for governments, critical infrastructure providers and 
9

enterprise customers. Our vision for security and intelligence data mining solutions is powered by our Actionable Intelligence platform to generate intelligence and insights from structured and unstructured data.
Trends
We believe that the key trends driving demand for security and intelligence data mining solutions include:

• | Security Threats Remain Pervasive Globally, and Preventing Crime and Terrorism Is Becoming More Complex. Governments, critical infrastructure providers, and enterprises face ongoing security threats from criminal and terrorist organizations, foreign governments, and other groups and individuals looking to do harm. Increasingly, these security threats come from well-organized and well-funded operations utilizing highly sophisticated methods and technologies. As a result, detecting, investigating, and responding to security threats is becoming more complex. Security and intelligence organizations responsible for addressing these increasingly sophisticated threats are seeking advanced data mining solutions to help them generate Actionable Intelligence. Such solutions often involve collecting, fusing, and analyzing structured and unstructured data from multiple sources, including from cyber space and a variety of other data and communications networks. We believe that the increasing complexity and technological challenges related to preventing crime and terror will drive customer demand for greater intelligence and for data mining solutions such as ours. 


• | Security Organizations Face Competing Budget Priorities and a Global Shortage of Qualified Intelligence Analysts and Data Scientists. Security organizations are seeking sophisticated technology to help combat crime and terror. While security threats are becoming more complex, security spending competes with other spending priorities. Organizations need to employ a large number of intelligence analysts and data scientists to meet the increasing complexity of an ever-growing number of security threats. Even with adequate budgets, there is a shortage of such qualified personnel globally, leading to elongated investigations and increased risk that security threats are not addressed. We believe that competing budget priorities and the shortage of qualified personnel have made security and intelligence data mining solutions critical, as they provide customers with automation, drive operational efficiencies, and improve the quality and speed of investigations. 


• | Security Organizations Seek To Partner With Vendors That Can Bring Both Sophisticated Data Mining Software and Deep Domain Expertise. Security operations involve people, processes, and technology, including data mining software. To facilitate the effective deployment of data mining solutions, in many cases security organizations seek to partner with vendors that can also offer relevant domain expertise and can deliver turnkey solutions. We believe that security and intelligence data mining solutions that incorporate domain expertise with advanced analytical technologies better enable customers to achieve their objectives of generating Actionable Intelligence and of accelerating investigations without major budget increases or the need to employ large numbers of data scientists and security analysts. We also believe that customers seek turnkey solutions that address their specific requirements and that are better aligned with their strategic needs and financial constraints, rather than unspecialized data analysis software that often requires expensive customizations and managed services. 

Strategy 
Our objective is to be the global leader in security and intelligence data mining software. The key elements of our growth strategy include:

• | Extending Our Market Leadership and Increasing Our Total Addressable Market (“TAM”) by Expanding Our Portfolio of Data Mining Solutions to Address Evolving Security Threats. Verint has a long history of working closely with leading security organizations around the world and has created a strong security and intelligence data mining solution portfolio based on a deep understanding of our customers’ needs. We are well positioned to expand existing customer relationships, win new customers, and continue to grow our portfolio to address evolving security threats. Historically, most of our Cyber Intelligence revenue has been generated from government customers. We see an opportunity to increase our TAM over time by leveraging our strong government experience to introduce new security and intelligence data mining solutions and domain expertise to critical infrastructure providers and enterprises that face complex security threats. 


• | Delivering Advanced Data Mining Solutions with Deep Domain Expertise to Improve the Velocity and Effectiveness of Our Customers’ Security Operations. Recognizing that security organizations face many evolving threats, while at the same time experiencing financial constraints and a shortage of intelligence analysts and data scientists, our strategy is to bring to market security and intelligence data mining solutions that can address specific customer needs. The design of our solutions is based on our deep knowledge of customers’ operational needs and advanced analytical technologies in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, predictive analytics, and 

10

visualization, with the goal of automating the intelligence process and reducing dependency on intelligence analysts and data scientists. We believe this approach enables our customers to gain Actionable Intelligence quickly and efficiently with higher quality and a lower total cost of ownership.

• | Partnering with our Customers and Offering Flexible Deployment Models. We are a strategic partner to our customers, providing them with security and intelligence data mining solutions to help address security threats and ensure the long-term success of their mission. Our strategy is to offer customers multiple options to deploy our solutions, including working directly with us in a turnkey project or indirectly through systems integrators. Many of our customers choose Verint to deploy turnkey projects that include software, hardware, and services (including from third-party vendors), while other customers choose to implement our security and intelligence data mining software in conjunction with hardware and services provided by others. Regardless of how customers deploy our solutions, we are constantly working to enhance our products and services to help them stay ahead of evolving security threats.

Cyber Security | Governments, critical infrastructure organizations, and enterprises are facing attacks from sophisticated malware. Due to the increased sophistication of these attacks they are becoming more difficult to detect, prevent, and investigate. Verint’s data mining cyber security solution helps organizations collect network, end-point, and other information from multiple sources and apply analytics in order to prioritize responses to attacks, automate part of the investigation process to reduce dependency on cyber analysts and data scientists, and reduce the critical time from detection to remediation. 
Critical Infrastructure | Critical infrastructure providers are mandated to protect sensitive assets, such as airports, bridges, electrical grids, pipelines, ports, nuclear power plants, water supplies, and government facilities. Given the large size of these types of assets, critical infrastructure providers seek solutions to help them detect and respond to threats efficiently and across large distances. Verint’s Critical Infrastructure security and intelligence data mining solution combines and analyzes data from a range of sensors and other systems to provide Actionable Intelligence to security personal, allowing them to centrally monitor and respond to security threats. 
Enterprise Security | Enterprises with significant risk of data loss, intellectual property theft, financial fraud, or other security risks are interested in data mining solutions to help mitigate such risks. For example, Verint’s Enterprise Security data mining solution has been deployed by a global pharmaceutical company to mine the open source web for counterfeit drugs that may infringe on their patent-protected pharmaceutical products. Verint’s Enterprise Security data mining solution has also been deployed by a large retail company to mine data captured in stores to help investigate and mitigate fraud.

Telecommunications Lawful Interception Compliance | Telecommunication carriers are mandated to comply with certain government regulations requiring them to assist the government in their evidence and intelligence collection process. This can involve collecting information from a wide range of sources across disparate networks. Verint’s Telecommunication Lawful Interception Compliance solution helps telecommunication providers comply efficiently and adequately with these regulations. 
Border Control | Governments are mandated to monitor and regulate borders to control the movement of people and goods into and out of a country. Borders can be very large and impossible to monitor with people alone. As a result, border control agencies seek physical security technologies, as well as intelligence gathering technologies, to adequately protect borders. Verint’s Border Control solution leverages data mining of machine data, telecommunications, social data, and enterprise systems to identify suspicious behavior, and help investigate and prevent border control incidents. 
Correctional Facilities | Correctional agencies are mandated to safely detain criminals in low, medium, and high security facilities. They are also required to ensure that criminals do not continue to conduct illegal activities from inside prisons. Verint’s Correctional Facilities solution assists prison monitoring through situational awareness and intelligence gathering capabilities to enhance physical security and help identify illegal activities from inside the prison. 

Our data mining solutions for security and intelligence listed above are delivered using a product, or several products implemented together, from our Cyber Intelligence portfolio described below:

Maintenance Support
We offer a range of customer maintenance support plans to our customers and resellers, which may include phone, web, and email access to technical personnel up to 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week. Our support programs are designed to help ensure long-term, successful use of our solutions. We believe that customer support is critical to retaining and expanding our customer base. Our Customer Engagement solutions are generally sold with a warranty of one year for hardware and 90 days for software. Our Cyber Intelligence solutions, and certain of our Customer Engagement solutions, are sold with warranties that typically range from 90 days to three years and, in some cases, longer. In addition, customers are typically provided the option to purchase maintenance plans that provide a range of services, such as telephone support, advanced replacement, upgrades when and if available, and on-site repair or replacement. Currently, the majority of our maintenance revenue is related to our Customer Engagement solutions.
Direct and Indirect Sales
We sell our solutions through our direct sales teams and indirect channels, including distributors, systems integrators, value-added resellers (“VARs”), and OEM partners. Approximately half of our overall sales are made through partners, distributors, resellers, and system integrators.
Each of our solutions is sold by trained, dedicated, regionally-organized direct and indirect sales teams. Our direct sales teams are focused on large and mid-sized customers and, in many cases, co-sell with our other channels and sales agents. Our indirect sales teams are focused on developing and supporting relationships with our indirect channels, which provide us with broader market coverage, including access to their customer bases, integration services, and presence in certain geographies and vertical markets. Our sales teams are supported by business consultants, solutions specialists, and pre-sales engineers who, during the sales process, help determine customer requirements and develop technical responses to those requirements. We sell directly and indirectly in both of our segments. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competition, Markets, and Operations—If we are unable to establish and maintain our relationships with third parties that market and sell our products, our business and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected” under Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion of certain sales and distribution risks that we face.
Customers 
Our solutions are used by over 10,000 organizations in more than 180 countries. In the year ended January 31, 2017, we derived approximately 66% and 34% of our revenue from the sale of our Customer Engagement and Cyber Intelligence solutions, respectively. In the year ended January 31, 2016, we derived approximately 61% and 39% of our revenue from the sale of our Customer Engagement and Cyber Intelligence solutions, respectively. In the year ended January 31, 2015, we derived approximately 63% and 37% of our revenue from the sale of our Customer Engagement and Cyber Intelligence solutions, respectively. We are party to contracts with customers in both of our segments, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on the segment.
In the year ended January 31, 2017, we derived approximately 54%, 30%, and 16% of our revenue from sales to end users in the Americas, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), and in the Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) regions, respectively. In the year ended January 31, 2016, we derived approximately 51%, 31%, and 18% of our revenue from sales to end users in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC, respectively. In the year ended January 31, 2015, we derived approximately 52%, 31%, and 17% of our revenue from sales to end users in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC, respectively. See also Note 16, “Segment, Geographic, and Significant Customer Information” to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report for additional information and financial data about each of our operating segments and geographic regions.
For the year ended January 31, 2017, approximately one third of our business was generated from contracts with various governments around the world, including local, regional, and national government agencies. Due to the unique nature of the terms and conditions associated with government contracts generally, our government contracts may be subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of the government customer. Some of our customer engagements require us to have security credentials or to participate in projects through an approved legal entity.
Seasonality and Cyclicality 
As is typical for many software and technology companies, our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical factors. In most years, our revenue and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter (prior to the impact of unusual or nonrecurring items). Moreover, revenue and operating income in the first quarter of a new year may be lower than in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, in some years, potentially by a significant margin. In addition, we 
14

generally receive a higher volume of orders in the last month of a quarter, with orders concentrated in the later part of that month. We believe that these seasonal and cyclical factors primarily reflect customer spending patterns and budget cycles, as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel. While seasonal and cyclical factors such as these are common in the software and technology industry, this pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or financial performance. Many other factors, including general economic conditions, also have an impact on our business and financial results. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion of factors which may affect our business and financial results.
Research and Development 
We continue to enhance the features and performance of our existing solutions and to introduce new solutions through extensive R&D activities, including the development of new solutions, the addition of capabilities to existing solutions, quality assurance, and advanced technical support for our customer services organization. In certain instances, primarily in our Cyber Intelligence segment, we may tailor our products to meet the particular requirements of our customers. R&D is performed primarily in the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Indonesia for our Customer Engagement segment; and in Israel, Germany, Brazil, Cyprus, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and Bulgaria for our Cyber Intelligence segment.
To support our research and development efforts, we make significant investments in R&D every year. In the years ended January 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we spent approximately $171.1 million, $177.7 million, and $173.7 million, respectively, on R&D, net. We allocate our R&D resources in response to market research and customer demand for additional features and solutions. Our development strategy involves rolling out initial releases of our products and adding features over time. We incorporate product feedback received from our customers into our product development process. While the majority of our products are developed internally, in some cases, we also acquire or license technologies, products, and applications from third parties based on timing and cost considerations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competition, Markets, and Operations—For certain products, components, or services, we rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers, and partners and if these relationships are interrupted, we may not be able to obtain substitute suppliers, manufacturers, or partners on favorable terms or at all and we may be subject to other adverse effects” under Item 1A of this report.
As noted above, a significant portion of our R&D operations is located outside the United States. We have derived benefits from participation in certain government-sponsored programs, including those of the Israeli Innovation Authority (“IAA”), formerly the Office of the Chief Scientist (“OCS”), and in other jurisdictions for the support of R&D activities conducted in those locations. In the case of Israel, the Israeli law under which our IAA grants are made limits our ability to manufacture products, or transfer technologies, developed using these grants outside of Israel without permission from the IAA. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competition, Markets, and Operations—Because we have significant foreign operations and business, we are subject to geopolitical and other risks that could materially adversely affect our results” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competition, Markets, and Operations—Conditions in and our relationship to Israel may materially adversely affect our operations and personnel and may limit our ability to produce and sell our products or engage in certain transactions” under Item 1A of this report for a discussion of certain risks associated with our foreign operations.
Manufacturing, Suppliers, and Service Providers 
While Verint is focused on developing enterprise software to accommodate customers’ desire for turnkey solutions, we will deliver solutions that incorporate third-party hardware components. This applies mainly to our Cyber Intelligence segment, as the majority of the solutions from our Customer Engagement segment are comprised of software and do not incorporate hardware components. We utilize both unaffiliated manufacturing subcontractors, as well as our internal operations, to produce, assemble, and deliver solutions incorporating hardware components. These internal operations consist primarily of installing our software on externally purchased hardware components, final assembly, repair, and testing, which involves the application of extensive quality control procedures to materials, components, subassemblies, and systems. We also perform system integration functions prior to shipping turnkey solutions to our customers. Our internal operations are performed primarily in our German, Israeli, and Cypriot facilities for solutions in our Cyber Intelligence segment, and in our U.S. facility for certain solutions in our Customer Engagement segment. Although we have occasionally experienced delays and shortages in the supply of proprietary components in the past, we have, to date, been able to obtain adequate supplies of all components in a timely manner from alternative sources, when necessary. We also rely on third parties to provide certain services to us or to our customers, including hosting providers and providers of other cloud-based services. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competition, Markets, and Operations—For certain products, components, or services, we rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers, and partners, and if these relationships are interrupted we may not be able to obtain substitute 
15

suppliers, manufacturers, or partners on favorable terms or at all and we may be subject to other adverse effects” under Item 1A of this report for a discussion of risks associated with our manufacturing operations and suppliers.
Employees 
As of January 31, 2017, we employed approximately 5,100 professionals, including certain contractors, with approximately 44%, 21%, 23%, and 12% of our employees and contractors located in the Americas, Israel, EMEA (excluding Israel), and APAC, respectively.
We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and a critical factor in our success. Our employees in the United States are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements. In some cases, our employees outside the United States are automatically subject to certain protections negotiated by organized labor in those countries directly with the government or trade unions, or are automatically entitled to severance or other benefits mandated under local laws. For example, while we are not a party to any collective bargaining or other agreement with any labor organization in Israel, certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General Federation of Laborers in Israel) and the Coordinating Bureau of Economic Organizations (including the Manufacturers’ Association of Israel) are applicable to our Israeli employees by virtue of expansion orders of the Israeli Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor.
Intellectual Property Rights 
General
Our success depends to a significant degree on the legal protection of our software and other proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, and confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees and third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
Patents
As of January 31, 2017, we had more than 800 patents and patent applications worldwide, including more than 130 patent issuances or allowances during the past year. We have accumulated a significant amount of proprietary know-how and expertise in developing Actionable Intelligence solutions. We regularly review new areas of technology related to our businesses to determine whether they can and should be patented.
Licenses
While we employ many of our innovations exclusively in our products and services, we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies. Our licenses are designed to prohibit unauthorized use, copying, and disclosure of our software technology. When we license our software to customers, we require license agreements containing restrictions and confidentiality terms customary in the industry in order to protect our proprietary rights in the software. These agreements generally warrant that the software and propriety hardware will materially comply with written documentation and assert that we own or have sufficient rights in the software we distribute and have not violated the intellectual property rights of others.
We license our products in a format that does not permit users to change the software code. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competition, Markets, and Operations—For certain products, components, or services, we rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers, and partners, and if these relationships are interrupted we may not be able to obtain substitute suppliers, manufacturers, or partners on favorable terms or at all and we may be subject to other adverse effects” under Item 1A of this report.
We license certain software, technology, and related rights for use in the manufacture and marketing of our products and pay royalties to third parties under such licenses and other agreements. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based on industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.
Trademarks and Service Marks
We use various trademarks and service marks to protect the marks used in our business. We also claim common law protections for other marks we use in our business. Competitors and other companies could adopt similar marks or try to prevent us from using our marks, consequently impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Information/Product Security and Intellectual Property—Our intellectual property may not be adequately protected” under Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion regarding the risks associated with the protection of our intellectual property.
16

Competition 
We face strong competition in all of our markets, and we expect that competition will persist and intensify.
In our Customer Engagement segment, our competitors include Aspect Software, Inc., eGain Corporation, Genesys Telecommunications, Medallia Inc., NICE Systems Ltd., Pegasystems Inc., and divisions of larger companies, including Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, and Salesforce.com, Inc., along with many smaller companies, which can vary across regions. In our Cyber Intelligence segment, our competitors include BAE Systems plc, Cyberbit Ltd. (a subsidiary of Elbit Systems Ltd.), FireEye, Inc., IBM Corporation, JSI Telecom, Palantir Technologies, Inc., and Rohde & Schwarz GmbH & Co. KG, along with a number of smaller companies and divisions of larger companies that compete with us in certain regions or only with respect to portions of our product portfolio, and many smaller companies, which can vary across regions. 
In each of our operating segments, we believe that we compete principally on the basis of:

• | Product performance and functionality;


• | Product quality and reliability;


• | Breadth of product portfolio and pre-defined integrations;


• | Global presence and high-quality customer service and support;


• | Specific industry knowledge, vision, and experience; and


• | Price.

We believe that our competitive success depends primarily on our ability to provide technologically advanced and cost-effective solutions and services. Some of our competitors have superior brand recognition and significantly greater financial or other resources than we do. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter our markets or we enter theirs, and as new products, services, technologies, and delivery methods are introduced, such as SaaS. In addition, consolidation is common in our markets and has in the past and may in the future improve the position of our competitors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competition, Markets, and Operations—Intense competition in our markets and competitors with greater resources than us may limit our market share, profitability, and growth” under Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion of the competitive risks we face.
Export Regulations 
We and our subsidiaries are subject to applicable export control regulations in countries from which we export goods and services. These controls may apply by virtue of the country in which the products are located or by virtue of the origin of the content contained in the products. If the controls of a particular country apply, the level of control generally depends on the nature of the goods and services in question. For example, our Cyber Intelligence solutions tend to be more highly controlled than our Customer Engagement solutions. Where controls apply, the export of our products generally requires an export license or authorization or that the transaction qualify for a license exception or the equivalent, and may also be subject to corresponding reporting requirements.
