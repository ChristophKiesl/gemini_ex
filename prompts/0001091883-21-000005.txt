Overview
As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “CIRCOR” mean CIRCOR International, Inc. and its subsidiaries (unless the context indicates another meaning). The term “common stock” means our common stock, par value $0.01 per share.
CIRCOR designs, manufactures and markets differentiated technology products and sub-systems for the industrial and aerospace and defense markets. We have a diversified flow and motion control product portfolio with recognized, market-leading brands that fulfill our customers’ mission critical and severe service needs. The Company’s strategy is to grow organically through innovative product development (including growth in the digital space), aftermarket growth, penetrating new regions, margin expansion and through complementary acquisitions; achieve world class operational excellence; and build an inclusive, growth-oriented culture that attracts and retains a diverse group of talent. We have a global presence and operate 21 major manufacturing facilities located in North America, Western Europe, Morocco, China and India. The Company has the following reportable business segments: Industrial segment (“Industrial”) and Aerospace & Defense segment (“Aerospace & Defense”). We sell our products directly to end-user customers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), as well as through Engineering, Procurement and Construction (“EPC”) companies and our channel partner network.
In 2020, we completed the divestiture of our loss-making Distributed Valves (“DV”) business. This action stemmed from our strategic decision to exit the upstream oil and gas valves market. This business and the associated loss on disposal were reported within discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion in this Item 1 relates only to our continuing operations unless otherwise noted. Refer to Note 1, Description of Business along with Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information. 
Strategies
Our objective is to enhance stockholder value by focusing on growth, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and disciplined capital deployment. Our strategy to achieve these objectives is to:
1) Build the Best Team. We are committed to creating a strong employee value proposition that attracts talented and diverse people to the CIRCOR team. We are also committed to investing in, engaging, challenging and developing our employees through a variety of development programs. Our goal is to build an inclusive, growth-oriented culture that, when combined with robust process, appropriate metrics and individual accountability, will deliver extraordinary results.
2) Grow Organically and Through Acquisitions. We leverage the power of our global design capabilities to develop innovative products that solve our customers’ most challenging and mission critical problems. New product development is an important part of our growth strategy. We are driving innovation in our traditional flow control product lines, as well as augmenting the existing product offerings with digital solutions that address well-understood customer needs. We are focusing on regional expansion in areas where we see opportunity for our products but have limited presence today. Expansion of our aftermarket is also a key part of our organic growth strategy. We sell products that have strong aftermarket opportunity and endeavor to service our customers throughout the lifetime of the installed equipment. 
In addition to organic growth, we expect to acquire businesses over time. We are primarily focused on companies with differentiated technologies in complementary and adjacent markets. In addition to strategic fit and differentiated technology, the main criterion for an acquisition is return on invested capital.
3) Margin Expansion. Given our strategy of providing differentiated solutions to mission critical applications, we are driving value pricing across the Company, with a particular focus on aftermarket. We are also focused on the movement of operations to lower costs jurisdictions as well as simplifying our structure and optimizing centers of excellence to not only drive costs down and improve margins but to help us improve our customer service, operations and controls.
4) Achieve World Class Operational Excellence. Our Global Operations and Supply Chain organization is fully committed to achieving operational excellence in support of our customers’ expectations of high quality, on-time delivery and market competitiveness. We follow the CIRCOR Operating System (“COS”), which creates a disciplined culture of continuous improvement for driving operational excellence including a sales and inventory operations plan that provides for world-class quality and delivery while maintaining an optimal level of working capital. COS is comprised of ten business process attributes designed to engage and empower our employees to recognize and eliminate waste, work real-time problem solving as part of their everyday job experience, and enhance our performance both in operations and business office processes. Under the COS, our employees participate in a regimented training program and receive regular prescriptive assessments and action plans to drive process maturity. Quantitative performance metrics define site certification levels to help attain and sustain a level of quality, productivity, inventory management and market competitiveness that delights our customers, stockholders, and employees.

CIRCOR Consolidated
Competition
The domestic and international markets for our products are highly competitive. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than us. We consider product brand, quality, performance, on-time delivery, customer service, price, distribution capabilities and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors in these markets. We believe that new product development and product engineering also are important to our success and that our position in the industry is attributable, in significant part, to our ability to develop innovative products and to adapt existing products to specific customer applications. Our ability to leverage our large installed base of equipment to drive repairs and spares growth is a competitive advantage. 
The primary competitors of our Industrial segment include: Leistritz AG, Curtiss-Wright Corporation, Netzsch GmbH, ITT Corporation, IMI plc, TD Williamson Inc., Seepex GmbH, and Naniwa Ltd. 
The primary competitors of our Aerospace & Defense segment include: Transdigm, Crane Co., Curtiss-Wright Corporation, Moog, Inc., Parker Hannifin Corp., and Woodward Inc.

We maintain a Global Engineering Center of Excellence in India with a capable technology and engineering team that complements the engineering resources in a business unit.
Customers
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, no customers accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. Our businesses sell into both long-term capital projects as well as short-cycle demand. As a result, we tend to experience fluctuations in orders, revenues and operating results at various points across economic and business cycles. 
Selling and Distribution
Across our businesses we utilize a variety of channels to market our products and solutions. Those channels include direct sales, distributors and commissioned representatives. Our channel partner network typically offers technically trained sales forces with strong relationships in key markets. We believe that our established, global direct and indirect sales channels constitute a competitive strength. We believe that we have good relationships with our channel partners. 
Intellectual Property
The Company relies upon a combination of trade secrets and patent and trademark registrations to protect its intellectual property. Our patents are scheduled to expire between 2021 and 2030, and our trademarks can be renewed as long as we continue to use them. We do not believe the vitality and competitiveness of any of our business segments as a whole depends on any one or more patents or trademarks. We own certain licenses such as software licenses, but we do not believe that our business as a whole depends on any one or more licenses.
Raw Materials
The raw materials used most often in our production processes are castings, forgings and bar stock of various materials, including stainless steel, carbon steel, bronze, copper, brass, titanium and aluminum. These materials are subject to price fluctuations that may adversely affect our results of operations. We purchase these materials from numerous suppliers and at times experience constraints on the supply of certain raw material as well as the inability of certain suppliers to respond to our needs. Historically, increases in the prices of raw materials have been partially offset by higher sales prices, active materials management, project engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in our production processes.
Regulatory and Environmental Matters
Our business and operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the United States, in areas such as: competition, government contracts, international trade, labor and employment, tax, environmental protection, workplace health and safety, and others. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business, and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our operations, both favorably and unfavorably. Below is a summary of the some of the significant regulations that impact our business (see also Part I, Item IA, Risk Factors).
Government Procurement. The services we provide to the U.S. federal government are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Truth in Negotiations Act, export controls rules and Department of Defense (DOD) security regulations, as well as many other laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect how we transact business with our customers and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. A violation of specific laws and regulations could lead to fines, contract termination or suspension of future contracts. Our government clients can also terminate, renegotiate, or modify any of their contracts with us at their convenience.
Trade Controls. The export of our products is subject to applicable trade controls laws, including those in the U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom and China, and include, but are not limited to, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations, and trade sanctions against embargoed countries. A violation of specific laws and regulations could lead to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability. 
Anti-Bribery. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. In addition, an organization that “fails to prevent bribery” committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the U.K. Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented “adequate procedures” to prevent bribery. 
Human Capital 
CIRCOR’s success depends on our ability to attract, develop, engage and retain key talent. Management oversees and drives a number of vital employee programs in support of these goals.
Employee Profile
As of December 31, 2020, CIRCOR had 3,138, employees, of which approximately 80% are full-time. 48% of this workforce was in Europe, 41% in the United States, 9% in India and the rest spread across the rest of Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.
39% of our workforce is composed of skilled direct labor working in our factories across the globe. 28% is indirect labor in support of this direct labor. 33% are SG&A staff (including engineering, sales, finance, human resources and legal personnel). 6% of the Company’s U.S. employees are unionized. Outside the United States, we have employees in Europe that are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association.
Approximately 19% of the Company's global workforce is female, and 14% of the Company's employees in leadership roles are female. Approximately 31% of the Company's U.S. workforce and 25% of our U.S. employees in leadership roles are racially or ethnically diverse. 
Talent Attraction
We employ a rigorous recruitment process to attract and hire the talent needed for our continued success and growth. This includes candidates from diverse backgrounds and with differing experiences. Candidates are carefully vetted and assessed in multiple stages and interviews. Our recruitment processes are designed to comply with local labor laws and regulations. 
We actively partner with universities across the globe to recruit promising graduate talent into various functions in the Company. We partner with Kellogg School (Northwestern University) to hire graduating MBAs each year into the Company’s general management rotation program. 
Talent Development
We are committed to developing its talent. Some of our employees participate in an annual Talent Review Process and Performance Management Process, which helps assess the performance as well as the potential of employees. We focus on investment in three main methods of developing talent: (1) on-the-job training, (2) mentorship and (3) training. 
We offer an annual Senior Leadership Program for top leaders and a Management Development Program for mid-level managers. In addition, we actively train our employees on diversity and inclusion, interpersonal skills, process improvement skills, compliance topics as well as technical skills at the site level. We work with high potential employees to create Individual Development Plans for them and provide opportunities for assessments and coaching as needed. In 2020, 50% of leadership positions were filled internally as CIRCOR lays heavy emphasis on promoting from within.
Talent Retention 
We are committed to creating a strong employee value proposition, and our retention strategy centers on building an inclusive, growth-oriented culture that is attractive to our employees. We have regular communications from our senior leaders to employees throughout the organization and provide channels for feedback. 
We periodically conduct employee engagement surveys and other similar surveys to measure employee engagement and satisfaction. In addition, our sites host town halls throughout the year to engage employees at a local level. In 2020 while many of our employees worked from home, sites have hosted online events to continue to facilitate employee engagement.
In addition, we offer competitive compensation and benefits packages that are designed to retain, motivate and reward our employees. CIRCOR has a Pay for Performance philosophy, and we align our compensation practices with reference to external benchmarks, internal comparisons and the relationship between management and non-management remuneration. Some of our employees participate in our short-term and/or long-term incentive program connecting payouts to achievement of key financial and other metrics and the employee’s contribution to those results. 
We also provide competitive benefits programs in line with local market practice. We regularly review our benefits packages globally, especially in light of changing employees’ expectations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2020 we supported more work from home opportunities, and we are rolling out a Flex Work Policy to accommodate employees after pandemic measures are lifted. 
We carefully monitor the voluntary attrition of our employees. In 2020, the annualized voluntary attrition rate was 7%. This is lower than our historical rate, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which we believe led to fewer employees leaving their jobs during 2020.
Employee Health & Safety
We are committed to protecting the health and safety of our employees, and safety is one of our Absolutes. Our Absolutes, which are Safety, Controls and Ethics, are the three imperatives underlying everything we do at CIRCOR. Our culture of safety includes an ongoing training program, stand downs when injury events occur and encouraging our employees to speak up if they see a safety hazard. 
We also utilize metrics to track employee safety. In addition to common lagging indicators, such as injuries, we look to leading indicators, such as safety observations and near-hits, integrated with established problem-solving methodologies to resolve any issue that endangers worker safety. Our total recordable incident rate for 2020 was 0.76. 
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created unique challenges for our employees, and we are striving to ensure the health, safety and general well-being of our teams. Actions we have taken in response to the pandemic challenges include the following: 
•Adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
•Increasing cleaning protocols across all locations;
•Initiating regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•Implementing temperature screening of employees at the majority of our facilities;
•Establishing physical distancing procedures for employees who need to be onsite;
•Providing additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies;
•Implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure;
•Prohibiting all domestic and international non-essential travel for all employees;
•Requiring masks to be worn in all locations where allowed by local law; and 
•Providing wellness seminars to employees addressing mental health needs exacerbated by the pandemic. 
Diversity & Inclusion ("D&I")
CIRCOR is committed to cultivating a workplace that makes diversity, equity, inclusion and transparency priorities in everything we do. In furtherance of that commitment, we have established active D&I initiatives in the areas of talent acquisition, talent development, total rewards, employee engagement and communications, which impact employees at all levels of the organization. In addition, we appointed our first D&I Leader, who is driving our D&I initiatives and goals. Our goal is to increase gender and racial/ethnic representation throughout the organization, including senior management, and our initiatives are focused on that goal.
D&I achievements in 2020 included the following:
•Developed strategy, priorities, goals and scorecard;
•Added D&I review in periodic Talent Reviews with sites, including section for Emerging Female Talent;
•Launched our first Employee Resource Group in late 2020, Women @ CIRCOR;
•Approval of Flex Work Policy in the United States and Germany (other jurisdictions will follow in 2021);
•Published D&I metrics; and 
•Multiple employee communications on D&I topics and initiatives.
