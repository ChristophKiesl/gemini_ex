Item 1. Business
OUR COMPANY
Unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms “Comstock,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company” or “the Company” mean Comstock Mining Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

The Company is an emerging leader in climate-smart mineral development and production of increasingly scarce strategic and precious metals, focused on conservation-based, high-value, cash-generating, minerals and metals essential to meeting the rapidly increasing demand for clean energy technologies. The Company has extensive, contiguous property in the historic Comstock and Silver City mining districts (collectively, the “Comstock District”) with fully permitted, metallurgical labs and an operational, mineral processing platform that includes a growing portfolio of gold, silver, lithium, nickel, cobalt, and mercury remediation extraction and processing facilities.
The Company’s goal is to grow per-share value by commercializing environment-enhancing, precious and strategic-metal-based products and processes that generate a rate of predictable cash flow (throughput) and increase the long-term enterprise value of our northern Nevada based platform. The next three years are dedicated to delivering that value by achieving performance objectives in line with the strategic plan approved by the Company's Board of Directors. The strategic plan is designed to deliver higher per-share value over the next three years, while positioning the Company for continued growth beyond 2023.
The Company began acquiring properties in the Comstock District in 2003. Since then, the Company has consolidated a significant portion of the Comstock District, amassed the single largest known repository of historical and current geological data on the Comstock region, secured permits, built an infrastructure and completed two phases of test production. The Company continues evaluating and acquiring properties inside and outside the district, expanding its footprint and evaluating all our existing and prospective opportunities for further exploration, development and mining.
The Company and its subsidiaries now own or control approximately 9,358 acres of mining claims, parcels, and royalty interests in the broader Comstock District and surrounding area. The acreage includes approximately 2,396 acres of patented claims and surface parcels (private lands), and approximately 6,962 acres of unpatented mining claims (public lands), which the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) administers. The Company's headquarters is on American Flat Road, immediately north of the Lucerne resource area and just south of Virginia City, Nevada.
Because of the Comstock District’s historical significance, the geology is well known and has been extensively studied by the Company, our advisors and many independent researchers. We have expanded our understanding of the geology through vigorous surface mapping and drill hole logging. The volume of geologic data is immense, particularly in the Lucerne and Dayton resource areas. We have amassed a large library of historical data and detailed surface mapping of Comstock District properties and continue to obtain historical information from public and private sources. We integrate this data with information obtained from our recent mining operations, to target prospective geological exploration areas and plan exploratory drilling programs, including expanded surface and underground drilling.
Our Dayton resource area and the adjacent Spring Valley exploration targets are located in Lyon County, Nevada, approximately six miles south of Virginia City. Access to the properties is by State Routes 341 and 342, both paved roads.
Our sale to Tonogold Resources, Inc. ("Tonogold") of the membership interests in Comstock Mining LLC ("Comstock LLC"), the owner of the Lucerne Mine, resource area and related permits, closed on September 8, 2020. The Lucerne resource area is located in Storey County, Nevada, approximately three miles south of Virginia City and 30 miles southeast of Reno. The Lucerne resource area was host to the Company’s most-recent test mining operations from 2012 through 2015. Lucerne is the subject of ongoing assessment, exploration and development plans by Tonogold. The Company retains a 1.5% net smelter return ("NSR") royalty in the Lucerne properties.
The Company achieved initial production and first poured gold and silver on September 29, 2012. The Company ceased mining in 2015 and concluded processing in 2016. From 2012 through 2016, the Company mined and processed approximately 2.6 million tons of mineralized material, and produced 59,515 ounces of gold and 735,252 ounces of silver.

Comstock Mining’s Corporate Realignment
Since 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved, and the Company's management has been pursuing, a transformational strategy focused on high-value, cash-generating precious and strategic metal-based activities (the "Strategic Focus"). The Company advanced the Strategic Focus by facilitating the formation of dedicated subsidiaries that optimize the alignment with the goal and the performance objectives. The realignment was completed in 2019, and the Company has begun investing in activities aligned with the performance objectives, including MCU, Pelen, and Comstock Royalty Holdings.
Figure 2 - Comstock Corporate Realignment
The Company completed the realignment during 2019, such that the new corporate structure is now well aligned with the Strategic Focus. Comstock Mining Inc. remains as the parent company that wholly owns the realigned subsidiaries. Comstock Processing LLC owns the American Flat processing facility and additional land for potential expansion. Comstock Northern Exploration LLC owns or controls the remaining Storey County exploration targets, primarily located north of the Lucerne properties, including the Occidental Lode. Comstock Exploration and Development LLC owns or controls the Lyon County mining claims and exploration targets, including the Dayton Resource Area and the Spring Valley target. Comstock Industrial LLC owns the Silver Springs properties and water rights. Comstock Real Estate Inc. owns the Daney Ranch and the Gold Hill Hotel. Comstock LLC controls the Lucerne properties, including those owned by Northern Comstock LLC, and is now owned 100% by Tonogold. The Company recorded a gain of $18.3 million associated with that sale during 2020.
Current Projects

The Company has identified many exploration targets on its land holdings in the Comstock District, but has focused, to date, on the Dayton resource area and, through our Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Tonogold, the Lucerne resource area (including surface and underground exploration). We have also leased other Storey County mineral properties, including the Occidental group and the Gold Hill group of exploration targets, to Tonogold, which is currently performing exploration activities and plans to ultimately develop towards feasibility for those assets. We are developing updated geological interpretations and associated exploration and development plans for the remaining areas, primarily the Spring Valley group of targets that we view as an extension of the Dayton resource area.
Dayton Resource Area and Spring Valley
 The Dayton resource area is south of Virginia City in Lyon County, Nevada. It generally includes the historic Dayton, Kossuth and Alhambra patents, including the old Dayton Consolidated mine workings, south to where the Kossuth patent crosses State Route 341. The historic Dayton mine was the last meaningful underground mining operation in the Comstock District, before being closed after the War Production Board published Limitation Order L-208, 7 F. R. 7992 on October 8, 1942, that closed down all gold mining operations in the United States and its territories. The Dayton resource area ranks as one of the Company’s top exploration and potential mine development targets. In January 2014, the Lyon County Board of Commissioners approved strategic master plan and zoning changes on the Dayton, Kossuth and Alhambra mining patents and other properties located in the Dayton resource area, enabling a more practical, comprehensive feasibility study for mining. Geological studies and development planning are currently underway utilizing data from extensive metallurgical testing and assessment during 2017, 30,818 feet of additional drilling completed in 2015, geophysical analysis and interpretation completed in 2013, and extensive geological data from pre-2013, drill programs.
The Spring Valley group of exploration targets lies adjacent to the Dayton resource area at the southern end of the Comstock District, where the mineralized structures, trending to the south from the Dayton resource area, lie mostly concealed beneath a veneer of sediment gravels. The area includes the Kossuth patented claim south of State Route 341, the Gennessee patented claim, the Dondero patented property, the Daney patented claim, the New Daney lode mining claims, and the Company’s placer mining claims in Spring Valley and Gold Canyon.
The Dayton Resource area and the remainder of the Company's Lyon County properties were the primary focus of a 3-D, airborne geophysical survey flown in September and October 2020 by Geotech Ltd of Aurora, Ontario, Canada.
Lucerne Resource Area
The Lucerne resource area has been the primary focus of the Company’s exploration and development efforts since 2003. It includes the previously mined Billie the Kid, Hartford and Lucerne mining patents, and extends east and northeasterly to the area of the historic Woodville (southern-most of the historic Comstock bonanzas), Succor and Lager Beer patents and north to the historic Justice and Keystone mines. The Lucerne resource area extends approximately one mile along a strike, with explored widths from 600 to 1,800 feet.
Our Lucerne exploration activities included open pit gold and silver test mining from 2004 through 2006, and from late 2012 through 2016. As defined by the SEC Industry Guide 7 and regulation S-K 1300, we have not yet established any proven or probable reserves at the Lucerne Mine, now owned by Tonogold.
Tonogold now controls the Lucerne resource area through their acquisition of the membership interests of Comstock LLC. Tonogold has begun work on an updated resource estimate, leading to a Preliminary Economic Assessment. The Company and Tonogold hold the key mining permits required to resume surface or underground mining of this area.
Tonogold Agreements
    There are three current agreements between Comstock and Tonogold: the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, the Mineral Exploration and Mining Lease, and the Lease Option Agreement for the Company's American Flat processing facility. Tonogold and the Company previously entered into an Option Agreement in 2017 that was terminated during 2019.
Membership Interest Purchase Agreement 
    On January 24, 2019, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) to sell its interests in Comstock LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Comstock with sole net assets of the Lucerne properties and related permits to Tonogold. The Purchase Agreement, as amended, requires a total purchase price and fees of $17.6 million, comprised of $11.5 million in cash (excluding interest) and $6.1 million in Tonogold Series D Convertible Junior Participating Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (“CPS”). Tonogold also guaranteed the Company’s remaining financial responsibility for its membership interest in Northern Comstock LLC, which owns and leases certain mineral properties in the Lucerne area, and assumed certain reclamation liabilities, both totaling approximately $7.0 million.
    At the initial closing on November 18, 2019, Tonogold received 50% of the membership interests of Comstock LLC. On September 8, 2020, the Purchase Agreement was closed, and 100% of the membership interests were acquired by Tonogold. The fair value of the consideration delivered by Tonogold for the membership interests in Comstock LLC was $18.8 million, including cash, CPS, and a note receivable, net of the contingent forward asset. The Company retains a 1.5% NSR royalty on the Lucerne properties.
Mineral Exploration and Mining Lease 
    Effective September 16, 2019, and restated on December 23, 2019, the Company entered into a renewable mineral lease with Tonogold for certain mineral properties owned or controlled by the Company in Storey County, Nevada (the "Exploration Lease"). The Exploration Lease grants Tonogold the right to use these properties for mineral exploration and development, and ultimately the production, removal and sale of minerals and certain other materials. The restated lease clarified and increased Tonogold’s exploration spending, permitting, and engineering commitments to a minimum of $1.0 million per year, for a cumulative total of $20.0 million over 20 years. Tonogold also committed to specific milestones for issuing technical reports on their results, culminating in a published Feasibility Report by the 20th anniversary of the agreement.
    The initial term of the Exploration Lease (the "Exploration Term") is 5 years, with Tonogold committing to spending at least $5.0 million for exploration, at the rate of $1.0 million per year, and to producing an NI 43-101 compliant technical report by the end of the 5th year. The Exploration lease will automatically renew for a second, 10-year term (the "Development Term") as long as the commitments have been met. During the Development Term, Tonogold is committed to an additional $10.0 million in expenditures for exploration, development, and technical reporting, at the rate of $1.0 million per year, and to producing an economically viable mine plan and an NI 43-101 compliant Pre-Feasibility report by the end of the 15th anniversary of the agreement. The Exploration Lease will automatically renew for a third, five-year term (“the Planning Term”) provided that the spending and reporting commitments have been met. During the Planning Term, Tonogold is committed to an additional $5.0 million in expenditures for exploration, development, permitting, and technical reporting, at the rate of $1.0 million per year. By the 20th anniversary of the agreement, Tonogold also commits to producing an economically viable mine plan, and an NI 43-101 compliant Feasibility report, and will produce a mutually agreed-upon schedule for placing the properties into production.
    Tonogold pays a quarterly lease fee of $10,000, in advance. The lease fee will escalate 10% each year on the anniversary date of the Exploration Lease. Tonogold will also reimburse the Company for all costs associated with owning the properties. The lease also provides for royalty payments after mining operations commence. For the first year following the commencement of mining, royalties will be paid at the rate of 3% of NSR for the properties. The rate will be reduced to 1.5% of NSR thereafter. The Company accounts for the Exploration Lease as an operating lease.
Occidental and Gold Hill Targets
The Occidental group and Gold Hill group of exploration targets represent longer-term exploration target areas that contain many historic mining operations, including the Overman, Con Imperial, Caledonia, and Yellow Jacket mines. We believe that our consolidation of the Comstock District has provided us with opportunities to utilize the historical information available to identify drilling targets with significant potential.
The Occidental and Gold Hill properties are currently being explored through drilling by Tonogold under their Mineral Exploration and Mining Lease.
Lease Option Agreement for the American Flat processing facility
The Company and Tonogold also entered into an agreement (the "Lease Option Agreement") to lease its permitted American Flat property, plant and equipment to Tonogold for crushing, leaching and processing material from the Lucerne Mine. If the option is exercised, Tonogold will pay the Company a rental fee of $1.0 million per year plus $1 per processed ton, in addition to all the costs of operating and maintaining the facility, up to and until the first $15.0 million in rental fees are paid, 
and then stepping down to $1.0 million per year and $0.50 per processed ton for the next $10.0 million paid to Comstock, and then stepping down again, after the first $25.0 million of revenue is received, to $0.25 cents per processed ton, with no annual rental fee but with a $100,000 per quarter minimum revenue. Tonogold will reimburse American Flat expenses of approximately $1.1 million per year during the option life.

Principal Operating Segments

We did not have any production or revenue in our mining segment during 2020 or 2019, and we had $0.2 million of revenues in our real estate segment for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We had operating losses of $4.9 million and $5.5 million in our mining segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and an operating loss of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and operating income of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 in our real estate segment. We had total assets of $34.3 million and $8.8 million in our mining and real estate segments, respectively, at December 31, 2020. We had total assets of $30.1 million and $9.5 million in our mining and real estate segments, respectively, at December 31, 2019. See Note 20, Segment Reporting, to the consolidated financial statements.
Government Regulation

Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances, and other matters. We have obtained substantially all licenses, permits, and other authorizations currently required for our mining, exploration and other development programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations. Capital expenditures relating to compliance with laws and regulations that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, comprise a substantial part of our historical capital expenditures and our anticipated future capital expenditures. For example, we incur certain expenses and liabilities associated with our reclamation obligations. See Reclamation section below.
Reclamation

We are generally required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping, and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with plans reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.

The Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 519A to 519A.280 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 519A.010 to 519A.415 promulgated by the Nevada State Environmental Commission and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (“NDEP”), Bureau of Mining and Reclamation (“BMRR”) require a surety bond to be posted for mining projects so that, after completion of the work on such mining projects, the sites are left safe, stable and capable of providing for a productive post-mining use. Over the past four years, the Company has provided a reclamation surety bond, through the Lexon Surety Group (“Lexon”), with the BMRR. The BMRR, with concurrence from Storey County, has approved our most recent reclamation plan, as revised, and our estimated total costs related thereto of approximately $7.3 million, including $6.8 million for BMRR and $0.5 million of additional reclamation surety bonding, primarily with Storey County. 
As part of the surety agreement, the Company agreed to pay a 2.0% annual bonding fee and signed a corporate guarantee. The cash collateral percentage held on deposit by Lexon is typically one third or less of the current bond amount. At December 31, 2020, the total current bonded amount is $7.3 million, and the total collateral held on deposit was $2.7 million. 
Competition

We compete with other mineral exploration and mining companies in connection with the acquisition of gold and other mineral properties, and the attraction and retention of human capital. Such competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than we do.
History

    The Company began acquiring properties and developing projects in the Comstock District in 2003. The Company produced over 12,000 ounces of gold and over 53,000 ounces of silver from 2004 through 2006 from our Billie the Kid mine and American Flat heap leach processing facilities. Our test mining activities were concluded in January 2007 when, based on our longer-term production plans, we prioritized land consolidation and mine planning. 
    After five years of intensive geological mapping and interpretation, drilling, resource modeling and mine planning, the Company restarted mining operations in the third quarter of 2012 and resumed pouring doré bars of silver and gold in September 2012. The Company produced 59,515 ounces of gold and 735,252 ounces of silver from September 2012 through December 2016. The Company completed leaching from its existing leach pads in December 2016, and has since focused on exploration and development activities, primarily in the Lucerne and Dayton resource areas.
In September 2020, the Company completed the sale of Comstock LLC, owner of the Lucerne Mine, resource area and related permits, to Tonogold. The Company retains a 1.5% NSR royalty interest in the Lucerne properties.
Customers

    The Company is not economically dependent on a limited number of customers for the sale of its product. The real estate segment has numerous customers and is not dependent on any one customer.
Financing Events
S-3 Shelf Registration
On February 18, 2019, the Company filed an S-3 shelf registration with the SEC (the "S-3 Shelf"), for the sale of up to $50 million of the Company’s securities, from time to time, and used $8.2 million of that capacity through December 31, 2020, leaving an aggregate unused capacity of $41.8 million. As long as the aggregate market value of the Company’s voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates is less than $75.0 million, the aggregate market value of securities sold by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to the S-3 Shelf during the period of 12 calendar months immediately prior to such sales is limited to being no more than one-third of the aggregate market value of the Company’s non-affiliated voting and non-voting common equity. On December 31, 2020 and March 5, 2021, these limitations resulted in $8.8 million and $20.8 million, respectively, of unrestricted, available S-3 Shelf capacity. There can be no assurance the Company can sell common shares up to that capacity.
Equity Issuance Agreements
On March 2, 2021, the Company entered into equity purchase agreements (the “Equity Purchase Agreements”) with certain investors to issue and sell in a registered direct offering (the “Offering”) 4.0 million shares of common stock at a price of $4.00 per share. The shares are being offered by the Company pursuant to its shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-229890) filed with the SEC on February 26, 2019 and declared effective on March 7, 2019, and prospectus supplement thereunder dated March 2, 2021, and filed with the SEC on March 2, 2021. The Equity Purchase Agreements contain customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, and customary conditions to closing, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties. The Offering of the shares closed on March 4, 2021. The Company paid Noble Capital Markets, Inc., the placement agent for the Offering, an aggregate cash fee equal to 6% fee of the aggregate gross proceeds raised in the Offering, and agreed to pay up to $30,000 for other fees and expenses, resulting in expected net offering proceeds of $15.0 million.
On February 8, 2021, the Company entered into an equity purchase agreement (the “2021 Leviston Sales Agreement”) with Leviston Resources LLC (“Leviston”) to offer and sell registered shares of common stock at an aggregate offering price of up to $5.0 million from time to time, at the Company’s option, on terms deemed favorable to the Company. Any shares offered and sold will be issued pursuant to the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and the related prospectus (File No. 333-229890) filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act.
Sales of common stock, if any, under the 2021 Leviston Sales Agreement may be made in sales deemed to be “at-the-market” equity offerings as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act, at a price of ninety percent (90%) of the volume weighted average closing sales price per share of the common stock on the NYSE American stock exchange on the day of each respective put date.
In July 2020, the Company entered into an equity purchase agreement (the "2020 Triton Equity Agreement") with Triton Funds L.P., (“Triton”) to offer and sell registered shares of common stock at an aggregate offering price of up to $1.25 million, from time to time, at the Company's option. In July 2020, the Company issued to Triton 2,040,483 common shares with an aggregate sales price of $1.25 million, at an average price per share of $0.61, and paid related cash fees of $15,000. At December 31, 2020, the 2020 Triton Equity Agreement has no capacity.
Also in July 2020, the Company entered into an equity purchase agreement (the “2020 Leviston Sales Agreement”) with Leviston to offer and sell registered shares of common stock at an aggregate offering price of up to $2.5 million, from time to time, at the Company's option, and paid a commitment fee of $125,000 in shares of common stock and $52,500 of cash fees. From July through September 2020, the Company issued to Leviston 2,793,586 common shares with an aggregate sales price of $2.5 million, at an average price per share of $0.89, and an additional 173,611 common shares in commitment fees. At December 31, 2020, the 2020 Leviston Sales Agreement has no remaining capacity.
In October 2019, the Company entered into an equity purchase agreement (the “2019 Leviston Sales Agreement”) with Leviston to offer and sell registered shares of common stock at an aggregate offering price of up to $1.25 million, from time to time, at the Company’s option, subject to certain restrictions and a $125,000 fee payable to Leviston in shares of common stock. In October 2019, the Company issued to Leviston 1,863,150 common shares with an aggregate sales price of $0.8 million, at an average price per share of $0.43, and an additional 284,852 common shares in commitment fees. From March through July 2020, the Company issued to Leviston an additional 913,539 common shares with an aggregate sales price of $0.4 million, at an average price per share of $0.49.

See Note 14, Equity, and Note 22, Subsequent Events, to the consolidated financial statements.
Convertible Preferred Stock
In June 2019, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Temple Tower Group LLC ("Temple") providing for the issuance and sale to Temple of 1,274 shares of convertible preferred stock with a stated value of $1,000 per share, for net proceeds to the Company of $1.1 million, with 191 of the preferred shares representing due diligence fees. The total of 1,274 preferred shares had a stated value of $1.3 million and a fair value of $1.5 million based on a third-party valuation study. The Company recorded the difference between the net proceeds of $1.1 million and the fair value of $1.5 million as a cost of issuing the preferred shares.
The preferred shares were issued pursuant to the Company’s S-3 Shelf, and were convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock. The number of common shares issuable upon conversion was determined by dividing the stated value of the preferred shares by the conversion price. The conversion price was calculated as 90% of the lowest reported volume-weighted average price per share of the Company’s common stock as reported at the close of trading on the NYSE American stock exchange during the seven trading days ending on, and including, the date of the notice of conversion. From July through September 2019, Temple converted all of the preferred shares for 2,240,441 common shares at an average conversion price per share of $0.57.
Reverse Stock Split
In November 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a one-for-five (1:5) reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) for all issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.000666, and a 
contemporaneous one-for-five (1:5) reduction in the number of shares of the Company’s authorized common stock from 790,000,000 to 158,000,000 shares. The Reverse Split resulted in each outstanding five pre-split shares of common stock automatically combining into one new share of common stock without any action on the part of the stockholders. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Split. Fractional shares were rounded up to the nearest whole share, requiring the issuance of 9,114 additional shares of common stock, included in issuance of common stock in the consolidated statements of changes in equity. The Reverse Split was effective for trading purposes on November 29, 2019. The total number of outstanding common shares was reduced from 126,970,215 to 25,394,043 on the effective date. All common shares and per share amounts set forth herein give effect to this Reverse Split. The Reverse Split also applies to awards available for issuance under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors

An investment in our securities involves risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report, in evaluating our Company, its business, its industry and prospects. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also have a material adverse effect on us. The following risks could cause our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the market price of our securities could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.
Business and Operating Risks
You may lose all or part of your investment.

If we are unable to find, effectively develop, mine, recover and sell adequate quantities of gold and silver, or generate cash flows from our other diversified precious and strategic metals production and processing activities (including, but not limited to, metals exploration, engineering, resource development, economic feasibility assessments, mineral production, metal processing and related ventures of environmentally friendly, and economically enhancing mining technologies), it is unlikely that the cash generated from our internal operations will suffice as a source of the liquidity necessary for anticipated working capital requirements. There is no assurance that the Company’s initiatives to improve its liquidity and financial position will be successful. Accordingly, there is substantial risk that the Company will be unable to continue as a going concern. In the event of insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of the Company, the Company’s creditors would be entitled to payment in full out of the Company’s assets before holders of common stock would be entitled to any payment, and the claims on such assets may exceed the value of such assets.

We have a limited operating history.

We have a limited operating history. The success of our Company is significantly dependent on the uncertain events of the discovery and exploitation of mineralized materials on our properties, selling the rights to exploit those materials, and/or commercializing our other diversified precious and strategic metals production and processing activities. If our business plan is not successful and we are not able to operate profitably, then our securities may become worthless and investors may lose all of their investment in our Company.
Because we may never earn significant revenues from our mine operations or our other diversified precious metal-based and strategic metals production and processing activities, our business may fail. 
We recognize that if we are unable to generate significant revenues from the exploration and exploitation of our mineralized materials or our other diversified precious and strategic metals production and processing activities in the future, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. We have yet to generate positive operating income and there can be no assurance that we will ever operate profitably. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide no assurance that we will generate significant revenues or ever achieve profitability. If we are unsuccessful, our business will fail and investors may lose all of their investment in our Company.

We are exposed to global health, economic and market risks that are beyond our control, which could adversely affect our financial results and capital requirements.
The outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus, specifically identified as “COVID-19”, has resulted in governments worldwide enacting emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus. These measures, including the implementation of travel bans, quarantine periods and social distancing, have caused material disruptions to global business and an economic downturn. Global equity markets have experienced significant volatility and weakness. Governments and their central banks have reacted with significant fiscal and monetary interventions designed to mitigate the impacts and stabilize economic conditions. 
Attempts at containment of COVID-19 have resulted in decreased economic activity which has adversely affected the broader global economy. Many countries around the world as well as the majority of the states in the United States have ordered their citizens to stay home in order to contain the spread of the virus. As part of the “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders, fewer businesses than normal are open and massive unemployment has resulted from business declines. At this time, the full extent to which COVID-19 will negatively impact the global economy and our business is uncertain, but pandemics or other significant public health events will most likely have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Such orders have already resulted in delays of MCU’s plans for commencing mercury recovery testing on the Comstock District and in the Philippines. It is not currently possible to reliably estimate the length and severity of these delays and the impact on the Company's financial condition, and that of its subsidiaries and partners in future periods.
Uncertainties regarding the global economic and financial environment could lead to an extended national or global economic recession. A slowdown in economic activity caused by a recession would likely reduce demand for assets that we hold for sale and result in lower commodity prices for long periods of time. Costs of exploration, development and production have not yet adjusted to current economic conditions, or in proportion to the significant reduction in product prices.
Transportation and weather interruptions may affect and delay proposed mining operations and impact our business plans.

Our mining properties are accessible by road. The climate in the area is hot and dry in the summer but cold and subject to snow and other precipitation in the winter, which could at times hamper accessibility depending on the winter season 
precipitation levels. As a result, our exploration and mining plans could be delayed for several months each year. Such delays could affect our anticipated business operations and increase our expenses.
Moreover, extreme weather events (such as increased frequency or intensity of storms or prolonged drought, flooded or frozen terrain) have the potential to disrupt operations at our projects. Extended disruptions to supply lines due to extreme weather could result in interruption of activities at the project sites, delay or increase the cost of construction of the projects, or otherwise adversely affect our business.

Supplies and equipment needed for exploration may not always be available. If we are unable to secure raw materials and exploration supplies we may have to delay our anticipated business operations.

Competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies needed for our proposed exploration work could result in occasional shortages of supplies of certain products, equipment or materials. There is no guarantee we will be able to obtain certain products, equipment and/or materials as and when needed, without interruption, or on favorable terms, if at all. Such delays could affect our anticipated business operations and increase our expenses.
We have invested capital in high-risk mineral and metals projects where we have not conducted sufficient exploration, development and engineering studies.

We have invested capital and have otherwise been involved in various mineral properties and renewable metals projects in the Storey and Lyon Counties, Nevada, where we have not conducted sufficient exploration, development and/or engineering studies to minimize the risk of project failure. Our mineral projects involve high risks because we have not invested sufficiently in the characterization of mineralized material, geologic analysis, metallurgical testing, mine planning and economic analysis. Standard industry practice calls for a mining company to prepare a formal mine plan and mining production schedule and have these documents reviewed and validated by a third-party specialist. We have not had a formal mine plan and mining production schedule economically validated by a third-party specialist.

We will not be successful unless we recover precious or strategic metals and sell them for a profit.

Our success depends on our ability to recover precious or strategic metals, process them, and successfully sell them for more than the cost of production. The success of this process depends on the market prices of metals in relation to our costs of production. We may not be able to generate a profit on the sale of gold or other minerals because we have limited control over our costs and have no ability to control the market prices. The total cash costs of production at any location are frequently subject to great variation from year to year as a result of a number of factors, such as the changing composition of the grade of the mineralized material mined for production, and metallurgy and exploration activities in response to the physical shape and location of the mineral deposit. In addition, costs are affected by the price of commodities, such as fuel and electricity. Such commodities are at times subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production unprofitable. A material increase in production costs or a decrease in the price of gold or other minerals could adversely affect our ability to earn a profit on the sale of gold or other minerals.

We do not have proven or probable reserves, and there is no assurance that the quantities of precious metals we produce will be sufficient to recover our investment and operating costs.

We do not have proven or probable reserves. Substantial expenditures are required to acquire existing gold properties with established reserves or to establish proven or probable reserves through drilling, analysis and engineering. Any sums expended for additional drilling, analysis and engineering may not establish proven or probable reserves on our properties. We drill in connection with our mineral exploration and mining activities and not with the purpose of establishing proven and probable reserves. While we estimate the amount of mineralized material we believe exists on our properties, our calculations are subject to uncertainty due to several factors, including the quantity and grade of the mineralized material, metal prices and recoverability of minerals in the mineral recovery process. There is a great degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of any mineralized material, particularly where there has not been significant drilling, mining and processing. Until the mineralized material located on our properties is actually mined and processed, the quantity and quality of the mineralized material must be considered as an estimate only. In addition, the estimated value of such mineralized material (regardless of the quantity) will vary depending on metal prices. Any material change in the estimated value of mineralized material may negatively affect the economic viability of our properties. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will achieve the same recoveries of metals contained in the mineralized material as in small-scale laboratory tests, or that we will be able to duplicate such results in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production. There can be no assurance that our exploration activities will result in the discovery of sufficient quantities of mineralized material to recover our investment and operating costs.

The cost of our exploration, development and acquisition activities is substantial, and there is no assurance that the quantities of minerals and metals we discover, acquire or recover will justify commercial operations or replace reserves (to the extent reserves are established in the future).

Mineral exploration, development and beneficiation, particularly for gold, silver and other strategic metals, is highly speculative in nature and frequently is nonproductive. There can be no assurance that our exploration, development and/or acquisition activities will be commercially successful. If gold mineralization is discovered, it may take a number of years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Substantial expenditures are required to acquire existing gold properties, to establish mineral reserves through drilling and analysis, to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal from the mineralized material and, in the case of new properties, to develop the processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mineral exploration. There can be no assurance that any gold reserves or mineralized material that may be discovered or acquired in the future, if any, will be in sufficient quantities or of adequate grade to justify commercial operations, or that the funds required for mineral production operation can be obtained on a timely or reasonable basis, if at all. Mining companies must continually replace mineralized material or reserves depleted by production. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in replacing any reserves or mineralized material acquired or established in the future.

The prices of gold and silver, lithium, nickel cobalt and other strategic metals fluctuate on a regular basis and a downturn in price could negatively impact our operations and cash flow.

Our operations will be significantly affected by changes in the market price of gold and silver if we are able to produce gold or other minerals. Gold and silver prices can fluctuate widely and may be affected by numerous factors, such as expectations for inflation, levels of interest rates, currency exchange rates, purchases and sales by governments and central banks, monetary policies employed by the world’s major central banks, fiscal policies employed by the world’s major industrialized economies, forward selling or other hedging activities, demand for diversified precious and strategic metals, global or regional political and economic crises, and production costs in major gold-producing regions, such as but not limited to South Africa and the Russian Federation. The aggregate effect of these factors, all of which are beyond our control, is impossible for us to predict. If gold or silver prices decline substantially, it could adversely affect the realizable value of our assets and, potentially, future results of operations and cash flow.
We plan to pursue opportunities to acquire properties with gold or silver reserves or mineralized material with exploration potential. The price that we pay to acquire these properties will be influenced, in large part, by the price of gold and silver at the time of the acquisition. We expect our potential future revenues to be derived from the production and sale of gold and silver from these properties or from the sale of some of these properties. The value of any mineralized material, and the value of any potential mineral production therefrom, will vary in direct proportion to variations in those mineral prices. The price of gold and silver has fluctuated widely as a result of numerous factors beyond our control. The effect of these factors on the price of gold and silver, and therefore the economic viability of our projects, cannot accurately be predicted. Any drop in the price of gold or silver would negatively affect our asset values, cash flows, potential revenues and profits.

The use of hedging instruments may not prevent losses being realized on subsequent price decreases or may prevent gains being realized from subsequent price increases.

We may from time to time sell some future production of gold pursuant to hedge positions. If the gold price rises above the price at which future production has been committed under these hedge instruments, we will have an opportunity loss. If the gold price falls below that committed price, we may experience losses if a hedge counterparty defaults under a contract when the contract price exceeds the gold price. As of December 31, 2020, we have no open hedge positions.

We compete with other mineral exploration, metal recycling and mining companies which could lead to the loss of opportunities.

We compete with other mineral exploration, metal recycling and mining companies or individuals, including large, established metals and mining companies with substantial capabilities and financial resources, to acquire rights to mineral properties, metal processing technology and other methods for extracting and processing precious, and other metals and minerals. There is a limited supply of desirable lands available for claim staking, lease or other acquisition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire such properties when competing against competitors with substantially greater financial resources than we have.
The estimation of the ultimate recovery of gold, silver and other metals is subjective. Actual recoveries may vary from our estimates. 

    We utilize the heap leach process to extract gold and silver from mineralized material, and plan on using leaching and co-precipitation processes for the beneficiation of other metals. The heap leach process extracts gold and silver by placing mineralized material on an impermeable pad and applying a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves a portion of the contained gold and silver, which are then recovered in metallurgical processes. We use several integrated steps in the process of extracting gold and silver to estimate the metal content of the mineralized material placed on the leach pad. The final amounts are not determined until a third-party smelter converts the doré and determines final ounces of gold and silver available for sale. We then review this end result and reconcile it to the estimates we developed and used throughout the production process. Based on this review, we adjust our estimation procedures when appropriate. Due to the complexity of the estimation process and the number of steps involved, among other things, actual recoveries can vary from estimates, and the amount of the variation could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Resource and other mineralized material statements are estimates only, and are subject to uncertainty due to factors including metal prices, inherent variability of the mineralized material and recoverability of metal in the mining and beneficiation processes. 

    Our reports of mineral resources, other mineralized material and grading are estimates and depend upon geological interpretation and statistical inferences or assumptions drawn from drilling and sampling analysis, which may prove to be unpredictable. There is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of mineral resources and corresponding grades. Until mineral resources and other mineralized materials are actually mined and processed, the quantity of mineralized material and grades must be considered as an estimate only. In addition, the quantity of mineral resources and other mineralized materials may vary depending on metal prices. Any material change in the quantity of mineral resources, other mineralized materials, mineralization, grade or stripping ratio may affect the economic viability of our properties. In addition, we can provide no assurance that gold recoveries or other metal recoveries experienced in small-scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production. 
Our mining and metal recycling production depends on the availability of sufficient water supplies.
    Our mining and metal recycling operations require significant quantities of water for mining, processing and related support facilities. Most of our mining and planned metal recycling operations are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production at our mines and metal recycling is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims, and the continuing physical availability of the water.
Cost estimates and timing of new projects are uncertain, which may adversely affect our expected production and profitability. 

    The capital expenditures and time required to acquire, develop and explore our projects, including the mercury remediation, lithium, nickel and cobalt recycling and the Dayton resource areas, are considerable and changes in costs, construction schedules or both, can adversely affect project economics and expected production and profitability. There are a number of factors that can affect costs and construction schedules, including, among others: 

•availability of labor, energy, transportation, equipment, and infrastructure;
•changes in input commodity prices and labor costs;
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
•availability and terms of financing;
•changes in anticipated tonnage, grade and metallurgical characteristics of the mineralized material to be mined and processed;
•recovery rates of gold and other metals from mineralized or recyclable materials;
•difficulty of estimating construction costs over a period of a year;
•delays in completing any environmental review or in obtaining environmental or other government permits;
•weather and severe climate impacts; and
•potential delays related to health, social, political and community issues.
We may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining.
    The exploration for natural resources and the development and production of mining operations are activities that involve a high level of uncertainty. These can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:
•environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals;
•industrial accidents, including in connection with the operation of mining transportation equipment, milling equipment and/or conveyor systems, and accidents associated with the preparation and ignition of large-scale blasting operations, milling, processing and transportation of chemicals, explosives or other materials;
•surface or underground fires or floods;
•unexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form);
•ground and water conditions;
•fall-of-ground accidents in underground operations;
•failure of mining pit slopes and tailings dam walls;
•seismic activity; and
•other natural phenomena, such as lightning, severe rain or snowstorms, floods or other inclement weather conditions.
Our activities are inherently hazardous and any exposure may exceed our insurance limits or may not be insurable.

Mineral exploration and operating activities are inherently hazardous. Operations in which we have direct or indirect interests will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration and production of gold and other metals, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to property and possible environmental damage. The nature of these risks is such that liabilities might exceed any applicable liability insurance policy limits. It is also possible that the liabilities and hazards might not be insurable, or we could elect not to insure ourselves against such liabilities because of the high premium costs, in which event, we could incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

The Company’s costs of close-down, reclamation and rehabilitation could be higher than expected.
Close-down and reclamation work to return operating sites to the community can be extensive and costly. Estimated costs are provided for, and updated annually, over the life of each operation, but the provisions might prove to be inadequate due to changes in legislation, standards and the emergence of new, or increases in the cost of, reclamation techniques. In addition, the expected timing of expenditure could change significantly due to changes in the business environment that might vary the life of an operation.
Our ability to execute our strategic plan depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.
    Our strategic plan is focused on high-value, cash-generating, precious metal-based activities, including, but not limited to, environmentally friendly and economically enhancing clean mining and processing technologies, precious-metal exploration, resource development, economic feasibility assessments and cash-generating mineral production. Many of the factors that impact our ability to execute our strategic plan, such as the advancement of certain technologies, legal and regulatory obstacles and general economic conditions, are beyond our control. Changes in value or a lack of demand for the sale of non-core assets would negatively affect the Company’s financial condition and performance. Our inability to identify successful joint venture candidates and to complete joint ventures or strategic alliances as planned or to realize expected synergies and strategic benefits could impact our financial condition and performance. Our inability to deploy capital to maximize shareholder value could impact our financial performance. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to execute any or all of our strategic plan. Failure to execute any or all of our strategic plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
Diversity in application of accounting literature in the mining industry may impact our reported financial results.
    The mining industry has limited industry-specific accounting literature and, as a result, we understand diversity in practice exists in the interpretation and application of accounting literature to mining-specific issues. As diversity in mining industry accounting is addressed, we may need to restate our reported results if the resulting interpretations differ from our current accounting practices. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.
We rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects.
    A significant portion of our operations and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:
•negotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;
•the inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;
•reduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;
•failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;
•interruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;
•failure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and
•problems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues.
    In addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
Our business requires substantial capital investment and we may be unable to raise additional funding on favorable terms.
The construction and operation of potential future projects and various exploration projects will require significant funding. Our operating cash flow and other sources of funding may become insufficient to meet all of these requirements, depending on the timing and costs of development of these and other projects. As a result, new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments and fund our ongoing business activities. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and silver prices, our operational performance and our current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and silver prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or a further dislocation in the financial markets as experienced in recent years, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing operations and retire or service all of our outstanding debt could be significantly constrained.
We may not be successful in selling non-mining related assets.
Our short-term plans include the sale of non-core, non-strategic, non-mining assets. The success of these plans depends on the market prices and demand for the purchase of such assets. We may not be able to generate sufficient funds from the sale of these assets to pay off our indebtedness or offset our other liquidity needs.
Owning real estate and water rights and options on real estate and water rights carries inherent risks.
We are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks beyond our control:
•Changes in national, regional and local economic conditions and outlook.
•Economic downturns in the areas where the properties are located.
•Adverse changes in local real estate market conditions such as an oversupply of properties, reduction in demand, loss of a larger employer, intense competition for buyers and/or demographic changes.
•Changes in business or consumer preferences that reduce the attractiveness of our properties.
•Changes in zoning, regulatory restrictions or tax laws.
•Changes in interest rates or availability of financing.
These conditions could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, or the market price of our stock.
Illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to changes in economic and other conditions.
Our ability to sell one or more of our properties in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions may be limited. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any of our properties for the price or terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective buyer would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing buyer and to the close the sale of an asset. The real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control.

The unique nature of our properties, including our held-for-sale properties, may make it difficult for us to sell or develop those properties and could require considerable, additional capital to adapt the properties for sale or other productive uses, and could negatively affect our financial performance.
•Time required to complete a sale or development may be greater than originally anticipated, thereby adversely affecting our cash flows and liquidity.
•Our water rights or the availability of water through wells or municipal water providers may not be adequate to support potential development.
•Water rights sales values are highly volatile.
•We may encounter other delays as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters, material shortages, and regulatory requirements.
Our indebtedness and payment obligations could adversely affect our operations, financial condition, cash flow, and operating flexibility.
    Our outstanding indebtedness and lease payment obligations, and the covenants contained in our debt agreements and documents governing such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. The size and terms of certain of our agreements limits our ability to obtain additional debt financing to fund future working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, engineering and product development costs, and other general corporate requirements. Other consequences for our operations could include:
•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our other indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such other indebtedness;
•impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes;
•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes;
•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and
•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt.
    Our ability to make required payments of principal and interest on our debt will depend on our future performance and the other cash requirements of our business. Our performance is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive, and other factors that are beyond our control in addition to challenges that are unique to the Company. We cannot provide any assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness and lease obligations.
    Our debt and lease agreements contain certain restrictive covenants and customary events of default. These restrictive covenants limit our ability to take certain actions, such as, among other things: make restricted payments; incur additional debt and issue certain preferred stock; create liens; engage in mergers or consolidations or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; make certain dispositions and transfers of assets; place limitations on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to make distributions; enter into transactions with affiliates; and guarantee indebtedness. One or more of these restrictive covenants may limit our ability to execute our preferred business strategy, take advantage of business opportunities, or react to changing industry conditions.
    Upon an event of default, if not waived by our financing parties, our financing parties may declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable, which may cause cross-defaults under our other obligations. If our current financing parties accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness or obligations, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to our financing parties on a timely basis, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance, or restructure the payments on such debt and lease obligations. Further, the financing parties would have the right to foreclose on certain of our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our Company.
Mining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities in which they operate.
    As a result of public concern about the real or perceived detrimental effects of economic globalization and global climate impacts, businesses generally, and corporations in natural resource industries, face increasing public scrutiny of their activities. These businesses are under pressure to demonstrate that, as they seek to generate satisfactory returns on investment to shareholders, other stakeholders, including employees, governments, and communities surrounding operations benefit and will 
continue to benefit from their commercial activities. Such pressures tend to be particularly focused on companies for which activities are perceived to have a high impact on their social and physical environment. The potential consequences of these pressures include reputational damage, legal suits, increasing social investment obligations and pressure to increase taxes and royalties payable to governments and communities.
Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks
Our ability to execute our strategic plans depends upon our success in obtaining a variety of required governmental approvals that may be opposed by third parties.

We do not possess all of the governmental approvals necessary to conduct the full extent of the operations contemplated by our strategic plan. Those operations will be delayed, hindered or prevented to the extent that we are unable to obtain the necessary permits and approvals in a timely fashion or at all. This inability may occur due to a variety of factors, including opposition by third parties, such as members of the public or environmental groups. We expect that future permit and approval applications and issuances will meet with similar opposition. We may encounter delays and added costs if permits and approvals are challenged.
Our operations are subject to strict environmental laws and regulations, which could result in added costs of operations and operational delays.

Our operations are subject to strict environmental regulations, which could result in additional costs and operational delays. All phases of our operations are subject to environmental regulation. Environmental legislation is evolving in the United States generally, and Nevada specifically, in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors, and employees. There is no assurance that any future changes in environmental regulation will not negatively affect our projects.
At the state level, mining operations in Nevada are regulated by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection ("NDEP"). Nevada state law requires our Nevada projects to hold Nevada water pollution control permits, which dictate operating controls and closure and post-closure requirements directed at protecting surface and ground water. In addition, we are required to hold Nevada reclamation permits required under Nevada law. These permits mandate concurrent and post-mining reclamation of mines and require the posting of reclamation bonds sufficient to guarantee the cost of mine reclamation. Other Nevada regulations govern operating and design standards for the construction and operation of any source of air contamination and landfill operations. Any changes to these laws and regulations could have a negative impact on our financial performance and results of operations by, for example, requiring changes to operating constraints, technical criteria, fees or surety requirements.
Regulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
    Our business is an energy-intensive undertaking, resulting in a significant carbon footprint. A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change that are viewed as the result of emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels. Legislation and increased regulation and requirements regarding climate change could impose increased costs on us and our suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future requirements becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition, financial position, results of operations and ability to compete.
Because our land holdings are within the Carson River Mercury Superfund Site, our operations are subject to certain soil sampling and potential remediation requirements, which may result in added costs and delays; and we are also potentially subject to further costs as the result of on-going government investigation and future remediation decisions.

Substantially all of our land holdings are within the Carson River Mercury Superfund Site ("CRMS") Study Area and portions are within the risk area boundaries identified by NDEP and the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"). These risk areas have been defined due to the known or suspected presence of certain contaminants of concern, including mercury, arsenic and lead. To comply with the agencies’ requirements in these areas, the Company conducts soil sampling pursuant to a plan that has been approved by NDEP. This sampling is intended to demonstrate the absence of contamination before mining, processing or other operations in that area. If contamination above agency-established levels of concern is encountered, the Company intends to excavate and process such materials for metals recovery wherever feasible. If 
metals recovery is not feasible, the Company may avoid or defer excavating in that area, remove the materials for disposal, or cover the area with clean fill material. Through this sampling program and, if necessary, removal of contaminated materials, the Company intends to enable NDEP and EPA to better define the CRMS and the currently designated risk areas so as to eventually exclude our land holdings from such areas and from the Site itself to the maximum extent feasible. NDEP and EPA are continuing to study the ecological and human health risks that may be presented by contaminated sediments in certain portions of the Carson River watershed and downstream areas. The agencies’ studies indicate that these contaminants are primarily associated with historic mining tailings that have been redistributed into these waterways. The agencies have not adopted a remedial plan for these sediments nor have they decided whether remediation will be undertaken. Thus, there is no assurance that the Company will not be asked to undertake additional investigatory or remediation activities or to pay for such activities by the agencies, or that future changes in CRMS-related requirements will not negatively affect our operations.

Our insurance and surety bonds for environmental-related issues are limited.

    Our insurance and surety bonds against environmental risks are limited as to the maximum protection against potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of the disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production. Further, there is no assurance that insurance carriers or surety bond providers will be able to meet their obligations under our arrangements with them. In the event that our environmental liabilities and costs exceed the coverage provided by our insurance carriers and surety bond providers, or such parties are unable to meet their obligations, we would have limited funds available to us to remedy such liabilities or costs, or for future operations. If we are unable to fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we also might be required to enter into an interim compliance measure pending completion of the required remedy.

We are subject to federal and state laws that require environmental assessments and the posting of bonds, which add significant costs to our operations and delays in our projects.

Mining companies must post a bond or other surety to guarantee the cost of post-mining reclamation. These requirements could add significant additional cost and delays to any mining project undertaken by us. Our mineral exploration operations are required to be covered by reclamation bonds deemed adequate by regulators to cover these risks.

BLM requires that mining operations on lands subject to its regulation obtain an approved plan of operations subject to environmental impact evaluation under the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). Any submission or significant modification to a plan of operations may also require the completion of an environmental assessment or Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS") prior to approval.
We may be subject to litigation.
    We may be subject to legal proceedings. Due to the nature of our business, we may be subject to a variety of regulatory investigations, claims, lawsuits and other proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. The results of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty due to the uncertainty inherent in litigation, including the effects of discovery of new evidence or advancement of new legal theories, the difficulty of predicting decisions of judges, and juries and the possibility that decisions may be reversed on appeal. There can be no assurances that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business.
Title claims against our properties could require us to compensate parties making such claims, if successful, and divert management’s time from operations.

There may be challenges to our title in the properties in which we hold material interests. If there are title defects with respect to any of our properties, we might be required to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property. The validity of unpatented mineral claims, which constitute most of our holdings in the United States, is often uncertain and may be contested by the federal government and other parties. The validity of an unpatented mineral claim, in terms of both its location and its maintenance, depends on strict compliance with a complex body of federal and state, statutory and decisional law. Although we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to our properties, we have not obtained title opinions or title insurance with respect to the acquisition of the unpatented mineral claims. The investigation and resolution of title issues would divert management’s time from ongoing exploration programs.

Risks Related to Investments in Our Common Stock
Our stock has historically been a penny stock and trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC’s penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock.

Our stock has historically been a penny stock. Rule 3a51-1 generally defines “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. When our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, additional sales practice requirements are imposed on broker-dealers that sell to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors.” The term “accredited investor” refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 (excluding one’s primary residence), or annual income exceeding $200,000 individually or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules (including Rule 15g-9) require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") sales practice requirements may also limit a stockbroker’s ability to buy or sell our stock.

In addition to the “penny stock” rules promulgated by the SEC, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and other information. Under interpretation of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy or sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.
If we are unable to maintain the listing standards of the NYSE American Exchange ("NYSE American"), our common stock may be delisted, which may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and value of our common stock.
Our common stock is traded on the NYSE American. To maintain our listing on the NYSE American, we must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuation as a result of periodic variations in our revenues and results of operations. If we fail to meet any of the NYSE American’s listing standards, we may be delisted. In the event of delisting, trading of our common stock would most likely be conducted in the over the counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities, which could have a material adverse effect on the market liquidity and value of our common stock.

The price of the Company’s common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly, which could negatively affect the Company and holders of its common stock.
The market price of our common shares is subject to volatility, has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to, among other things, changes in market sentiment regarding our operations, financial results or business prospects, the mining, metals, recycling or environmental remediation industries generally, coordinated trading activities, large derivative positions or the macroeconomic outlook. The price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile in response to our planned acquisition of a majority stake in LINICO Corporation. Certain events or changes in the market or our industries generally are beyond our control.
In addition to the other risk factors contained or incorporated by reference herein, factors that could impact our trading price include:
•our actual or anticipated operating and financial results, including how those results vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;
•changes in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to us or other industry participants;
•failure to declare dividends on our common stock from time to time;
•reports in the press or investment community generally or relating to our reputation or the financial services industry;
•developments in our business or operations or our industry sectors generally;
•any future offerings by us of our common stock;
•any coordinated trading activities or large derivative positions in our common stock, for example, a “short squeeze” (a short squeeze occurs when a number of investors take a short position in a stock and have to buy the borrowed securities to close out the position at a time that other short sellers of the same security also want to close out their positions, resulting in surges in stock prices, i.e., demand is greater than supply for the stock shorted);
•legislative or regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations specifically;
•the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;
•announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions, financings and other material events by us or our competitors;
•expectations of (or actual) equity dilution, including the actual or expected dilution to various financial measures, including earnings per share, that may be caused by equity offerings;
•actions by our current shareholders, including future sales of common shares by existing shareholders, including our directors and executive officers;
•proposed or final regulatory changes or developments;
•anticipated or pending regulatory investigations, proceedings, or litigation that may involve or affect us; and
•other changes in U.S. or global financial markets, global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity prices, credit or asset valuations or volatility.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.

The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We have relatively little research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no additional industry analysts commence coverage of the Company, the trading price for our common stock could be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock, or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.

We do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.

We currently expect to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board, subject to compliance with applicable law, our organizational documents and any contractual provisions, including under agreements for indebtedness we may incur, that restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends, and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and other factors that our board deems relevant. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.

The terms of the Operating Agreement of Northern Comstock LLC require significant cash payments and may significantly dilute the ownership interests of the common stock.

The Operating Agreement of Northern Comstock LLC requires that the Company make monthly cash capital contributions of $30,000 to Northern Comstock LLC and annual capital contributions in the amount of $482,500 payable in common stock or cash, at the Company's option, unless the Company has cash and cash equivalents in excess of $10,500,000 on the date of such payments, whereupon the Company would then be required to pay in cash. The number of shares to be delivered is calculated by dividing the amount of the capital contribution by the volume-weighted average closing price of the Company’s common stock on its primary trading market for the previous 20 consecutive trading days prior to such capital contribution. The Operating Agreement also provides for a one-time acceleration of $812,500 of the capital contributions payable when the Company receives net cash proceeds from sources other than operations that exceed $6,250,000. The agreement also includes an ongoing acceleration of the Company’s capital contribution obligations equal to 3% of NSR generated by the properties subject to the Operating Agreement. The Operating Agreement also provides that if the Company 
defaults in its obligation to make the scheduled capital contributions, then the remaining capital contribution obligations may be converted into the principal amount of a 6% per annum promissory note payable by the Company on the same schedule as the capital contributions, secured by a mortgage on the properties subject to the Northern Comstock LLC joint venture. The Operating Agreement requires that the remaining capital contributions, totaling $5.6 million at December 31, 2020, continue until September 2027, unless prepaid by the Company.

The Company may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future that could dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.

The Company is currently authorized to issue 158,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 34,980,766 shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which no Preferred Shares are outstanding as of the December 31, 2020. To maintain its capital at desired levels or to fund future growth, the board may decide from time to time to issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of common stock. In February 2021, the Company has also entered into an equity purchase agreement with Leviston Resources LLC relating to the offer and potential sale of up to $5.0 million of common stock. The term of the agreement is 24 months. The sale of these securities may significantly dilute stockholders’ ownership interest and the market price of the common stock. New investors in other equity securities issued by the Company in the future may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to, that may adversely impact, the Company’s current stockholders. On March 2, 2021, the Company entered into equity purchase agreements with certain investors to issue and sell 4.0 million shares of common stock at a price of $4.00 per share for expected net proceeds of $15.0 million. The offering of the shares closed on March 4, 2021.
Risks Related to Strategic Transactions 
We have made and may in the future pursue investments in other companies, which could harm our operating results.
    We have made, and could make in the future, investments in other companies, including privately-held companies in a development stage, and most recently LINICO Corporation, a lithium-battery recycler. Many of these private equity investments are inherently risky because the companies’ businesses may never develop, and we may incur losses related to these investments. The price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile in response to various investments, including in response to our investment in LINICO Corporation. In addition, we may be required to write down the carrying value of these investments to reflect other-than-temporary declines in their value, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
We may pursue acquisitions, divestitures, business combinations or other transactions with other companies, involving our properties or new properties, which could harm our operating results, may disrupt our business and could result in unanticipated accounting charges.
    Acquisitions of other companies or new properties, divestitures, business combinations or other transactions with other companies may create additional, material risks for our business that could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from our expected or projected results. Such risk factors include the effects of possible disruption to the exploration activities and mine planning, loss of value associated with our properties, mismanagement of project development, additional risk and liability, indemnification obligations, sales of assets at unfavorable prices, failure to sell non-core assets at all, poor execution of the plans for such transactions, permit requirements, debt incurred or capital stock issued to enter into such transactions, the impact of any such transactions on our financial results, negative stakeholder reaction to any such transaction and our ability to successfully integrate an acquired company’s operations with our operations. If the purchase price of any acquired businesses exceeds the current fair values of the net tangible assets of such acquired businesses, we would be required to record material amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could result in significant impairment and amortization expense in future periods. These charges, in addition to the results of operations of such acquired businesses and potential restructuring costs associated with an acquisition, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot forecast the number, timing or size of future transactions, or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating or financial results. Furthermore, potential transactions, whether or not consummated, will divert our management’s attention and may require considerable cash outlays at the expense of our existing operations. In addition, to complete future transactions, we may issue equity securities, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our profitability.
We may undertake joint ventures, investments, joint projects and other strategic alliances and such undertakings, as well as our existing joint ventures, may be unsuccessful and may have an adverse effect on our business.
    We have grown our business, in part, through strategic alliances and acquisitions, including through our shift to climate-smart mining and the related development project with partners that include Mercury Clean Up, LLC for the deployment of new metals extraction. We continually evaluate and explore strategic opportunities as they arise, including product, technology, business or asset transactions. Such undertakings may not be successful or may take a substantially longer period than initially expected to become successful, and we may never recover our investments or achieve desired synergies or economies from these undertakings.
    This notwithstanding, we may in the future continue to seek to grow our operations in part by entering into joint ventures, or undertaking investments, joint projects or other strategic alliances with third parties in diversified precious and strategic metals production and processing industries. These activities involve challenges and risks in negotiation, execution, valuation and integration, and closing of the transactions could be delayed or prevented by regulatory approval requirements, including permitting issues, or other conditions.
    Any future agreements that we may enter into also could expose us to new operational, regulatory, market, litigation and geographical risks as well as risks associated with significant capital requirements, the diversion of management and financial resources, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, sharing of proprietary information, loss of control over day-to-day operations, non-performance by a counterparty, potential competition and conflicts of interest. In addition, we may not be successful in finding suitable targets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. Even if successfully negotiated and closed, expected synergies from a joint venture, investment or other strategic alliance may not materialize, may not advance our business strategy, may fall short of expected return-on-investment targets or may not prove successful or effective for our business. We may also encounter difficulty integrating the operations, personnel and financial and operating systems of an acquired business into our current business.
    We may need to raise additional debt funding or sell additional equity securities to enter into such joint ventures or make such acquisitions. However, we may not be able to obtain such debt funding or sell equity securities on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The raising of additional debt funding by us, if required and available, would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in additional operating and financing covenants, or liens on our assets, that would restrict our operations. The sale of additional equity securities, if required and available, could result in dilution to our stockholders.
Tonogold may be unsuccessful in profitably producing precious metals, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
    As of December 31, 2020, Tonogold owes the Company $4,475,000 pursuant to its note receivable by the Company Further, the Company’s $3.9 million in common stock investments in Tonogold as of that date, could materially diminish if Tonogold is unsuccessful in profitably producing precious metals, or otherwise.
    Tonogold (and therefore the Company by extension) is susceptible to all of the same business risks that apply to the Company relating to financial, operational, lack of reserves/economic feasibility, regulatory and other matters set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. Tonogold’s failure to profitably produce precious metals could have a material adverse effect on any residual value of the Company in Comstock LLC, including, but not limited to, future lease payments and royalty payments, indemnification of reclamation liabilities and assumed Northern Comstock LLC obligations, and payment of other obligations under Tonogold's agreement with the Company. In addition, Tonogold’s management of the Lucerne may involve risks not otherwise present in wholly-owned projects, including the following: 

◦Tonogold has no operating history.
◦Tonogold may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with the Company’s interest.
◦We do not have any control over the development, financing, management and other aspects of the Lucerne project, which prevents us from taking actions that are in our best interest but opposed by Tonogold. 
◦ We may not maintain a good relationship with Tonogold and disputes between the Company and Tonogold may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business and could result in subjecting the Lucerne project to additional risk. 
◦Time delays associated with obtaining entitlements, unforeseen development issues, unanticipated labor and material cost increases, higher carrying costs, and general market deterioration and other changes may negatively impact the profitability and capital needs of Tonogold.
◦It may be difficult or impossible for Tonogold to obtain requisite financing on commercially reasonable terms, if it is able to secure financing at all.
◦Tonogold could become insolvent or bankrupt, which could have an adverse impact on the Company.
The nature of our strategic joint ventures is speculative and dependent on a number of variables beyond our control that cannot be reliably ascertained in advance.
The revenues and profits of an enterprise involved in the creation of new industries and markets are generally dependent upon many variables. Our customer appeal depends upon factors which cannot be reliably ascertained in advance and over which we have no control, such as unpredictable customer needs and competitive products. As with any new business enterprise operating in a specialized and intensely competitive market, we are subject to many business risks which include, but are not limited to, unforeseen marketing difficulties, excessive research and development expenses, unforeseen negative publicity, competition, product liability issues, manufacturing and logistical difficulties, and lack of operating experience. Many of the risks may be unforeseeable or beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we or our strategic joint venture partners will successfully implement our business plan in a timely or effective manner, that we will be able to generate sufficient interest in our products, or that we will be able to market and sell enough products and services to generate sufficient revenues to continue as a going concern.
If we are unable to commercially release products that are accepted in the market or that generate significant revenues, our financial results will continue to suffer.
There can be no assurances that consumer or commercial demand for our future products will meet, or even approach, our expectations. In addition, our pricing and marketing strategies may not be successful. Lack of customer demand, a change in marketing strategy and changes to our pricing models could dramatically alter our financial results. Unless we are able to release products and sell services that meet a significant market demand, we will not be able to improve our financial condition or the results of our future operations.
We may encounter manufacturing or assembly problems for products, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
To date, our strategic joint venture partners have only manufactured prototypes and a limited number of products. In addition, they are continually redesigning and enhancing products and we are designing new products based on that technology that we hope to market in the near future. The manufacture and assembly of such products involves complex and precise processes, some of which are totally dependent on other companies and consultants. There is no assurance that the strategic joint venture partners will not encounter any serious problems in the production of existing or new products. Any significant problems in manufacturing, assembling or testing products could delay the sales of products and have an adverse impact on our business and prospects. The willingness of manufacturers to make the product, or lack of availability of manufacturing capacity, may have an adverse impact on the availability of products and on the ability to sell products. Manufacturing difficulties will harm the ability to compete and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and may hinder our ability to grow our business as we expect.
We primarily depend upon two manufacturers and, if we encounter problems with these manufacturers, there is no assurance that we could obtain products from other manufacturers without significant disruptions to our business.
The products to be sold by MCU and LINICO Corporation are currently manufactured by two manufacturers. If these manufacturers are unable to manufacture equipment on a timely and cost-efficient basis, operations will be disrupted and our net revenue and profitability will suffer. Moreover, if those manufacturers cannot consistently produce high-quality products that are free of defects, the strategic joint ventures may experience a high rate of product returns, which would also reduce our profitability and may harm our reputation and brand. 
We may not be successful in developing our new products and services.
Our success will depend partially on our ability to introduce new products, services and technologies continually and on a timely basis and to continue to improve the performance, features and reliability of our products and services in response to both evolving demands of prospective customers and competitive products. There can be no assurance that any of our new or proposed products or services will maintain the market acceptance already established. Our failure to design, develop, test, market and introduce new and enhanced products, technologies and services successfully so as to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition.
There can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of new or enhanced products and services, or that our new products and services will adequately satisfy the requirements of prospective customers and achieve significant acceptance by those customers. Because of certain market characteristics, including technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product and service 
introductions and evolving industry standards, the continued introduction of new products and services is critical. Delays in the introduction of new products and services may result in customer dissatisfaction and may delay or cause a loss of revenue. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new products or services or improving existing products and services that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards.
In addition, new or enhanced products and services introduced by us may contain undetected errors that require significant design modifications. This could result in a loss of customer confidence which could adversely affect the use of our products, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations or financial condition.
General Risks
Our business depends on a limited number of key personnel, the loss of whom could negatively affect us.

Our officers and employees are important to our success. If any of them becomes unable or unwilling to continue in their respective positions, and we are unable to find suitable replacements, our business and financial results could be materially negatively affected.
Our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions.
    Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency, evolving in nature and include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. We believe that we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
