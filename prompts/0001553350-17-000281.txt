Our Company
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 24, 1997 and in 2004 we acquired PSI-TEC Corp., and in 2006 we merged with PSI-TEC Corp. PSI-TEC Corp. was originally founded by Dr. Frederick J. Goetz in 1991 and incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 12, 1995. In 2008 we changed our name to Lightwave Logic, Inc. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the Company, we, our or us and other similar terms means Lightwave Logic, Inc., a Nevada corporation.

Our principal executive office is located at 1831 Lefthand Circle, Suite C, Longmont, CO 80501, and our telephone number is (720) 340-4949. Our website address is www.lightwavelogic.com. No information found on our website is part of this report. Also, this report includes the names of various government agencies and the trade names of other companies. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the use or display by us of such other parties' names and trade names in this report is not intended to and does not imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, any of these other parties.

Overview

Lightwave Logic, Inc. is a development stage company whose P2ICTM technology addresses advanced telecommunication, data communications, and data center markets utilizing its advanced organic electro-optic polymer systems. The Company currently has two business segments to support its development activities, its materials development segment located in Newark, Delaware, and its photonic device design and development segment located in Longmont, Colorado. 
Materials Development

The Company designs and synthesizes organic chromophores for use in its own proprietary electro-optic polymer systems and photonic device designs. A polymer system is not solely a material, but also encompasses various technical enhancements necessary for its implementation. These include host polymers, poling methodologies, and molecular spacer systems that are customized to achieve specific optical properties. Our organic electro-optic polymer systems compounds are mixed into solution form that allows for thin film application. Our proprietary electro-optic polymers are designed at the molecular level for potentially superior performance, stability and cost-efficiency. We believe they have the potential to replace more expensive, lower-performance materials and devices used in fiber-optic ground, wireless and satellite communication networks.

Our patented and patent pending molecular architectures are based on a well-understood chemical and quantum mechanical occurrence known as aromaticity. Aromaticity provides a high degree of molecular stability that enables our core molecular structures to maintain stability under a broad range of polymerization conditions that otherwise appear to affect other current polymer molecular designs. 

We expect our patented and patent-pending optical materials along with trade secrets and licensed materials, to be the core of and the enabling technology for future generations of optical devices, modules, sub-systems and systems that we will develop or potentially out-license to electro-optic device manufacturers. The Company contemplates future applications that may address the needs of semiconductor companies, aerospace companies and government agencies.

Prototype Device Design and Development

Electro-optic Modulators

The Company designs its own proprietary electro-optical modulation devices. Electro-optical modulators convert data from electric signals (binary data) into optical signals that can then be transmitted over high-speed fiber-optic cables. These devices are key components that have historically limited the ability of telecommunications, data communications, data centers networks to keep up with the seemingly endless flow of data in the form of voice calls, text messages, pictures, video streaming that are being transmitted to a growing array of devices.

Polymer Photonic Integrated Circuits (P2ICTM)

The Company also designs its own proprietary Polymer Photonic Integrated Circuits. A Polymer Photonic Integrated Circuit is a photonic device that integrates several photonic functions on a single chip. We believe that our technology can enable the ultra-miniaturization needed to increase the number of photonic functions residing on a chip to create a progression like what was seen in the computer integrated circuits, commonly referred to as Moores Law. 

Current photonic technology is based on inorganic crystalline materials, which due to physical limitations have not been able to address devices such as slot waveguides that require highly miniaturized geometries. Slot modulators have the potential to scale in integration for increased functionality and would be highly beneficial to data center infrastructure. Organic electro-optic polymers have greater potential because they can be applied as a thin film coating. Our polymers are unique in that they can withstand extremely high semiconductor process temperatures to seamlessly integrate into existing CMOS manufacturing lines. Our devices, enabled by our organic electro-optic polymer material systems, work by affecting the optical properties of light in the presence of an electric field at extremely high frequencies (wide bandwidths) and possess inherent advantages over current crystalline electro-optic material contained in most modulator devices such as lithium niobate, indium phosphide and gallium arsenide.

Glossary

Glossary of select technology terms to provide you with a better understanding our Companys technology and devices:

Electro-optic devices - Electro-optic devices convert data from electric signals into optical signals for use in communications systems and in optical interconnects for high-speed data transfer.

Electro-optic material - Electro-optic material is the core active ingredient in high-speed fiber-optic telecommunication systems. Electro-optic materials are materials that are engineered at the molecular level. Molecular level engineering is commonly referred to as nanotechnology.

Electro-optic modulators - Electro-optic (E/O) modulators are electro-optic devices that perform electric-to-optic conversions within the infrastructure of the Internet. Data centers may also benefit from this technology through devices that could significantly increase bandwidth and speed while decreasing costs. Polymer E/O modulators can be designed and fabricated with multiple structures such as Ridge waveguide and slot waveguide. The waveguides allow the light to be efficiently coupled into and out of the modulators, and provide a basis for integrating modulators together.

Photonic Devices - Photonic devices are components for creating, manipulating or detecting light. This can include modulators, laser diodes, light-emitting diodes, solar and photovoltaic cells, displays and optical amplifiers. Other examples are devices for modulating a beam of light and for combining and separating beams of light of different wavelength.

Polymers - Polymers, also known as plastics, are large carbon-based molecules that bond many small molecules together to form a long chain. Polymer materials can be engineered and optimized using nanotechnology to create a system in which unique surface, electrical, chemical and electro-optic characteristics can be controlled. Materials based on polymers are used in a multitude of industrial and consumer products, from automotive parts to home appliances and furniture, as well as scientific and medical equipment.
Our Business Opportunity

Lightwave Logic, Inc. is developing next generation proprietary photonic devices that are based on our advanced electro-optical polymer material systems. Current legacy technology is based on inorganic crystalline materials, which has allowed for the proliferation of data over fiber optic cables. However, there are inherent molecular deficiencies that have prevented this technology from scaling down in price and up in functionality. This is primarily due to a closed valence structure that does not allow for the molecular improvements. The valence or valency of an element is a measure of its combining power with other atoms when it forms chemical compounds or molecules. Also, the physical properties of a crystal do not allow for its implementation into highly miniaturize slot structures that are in simple terms the pathways that light travels through in the device.

Organic polymer materials on the other hand, have free electrons that allow for limitless potential to combine with other molecular structures, which allows for multiple options and combinations to improving performance characteristics. Importantly, because they can be applied to optical structures in thin-film liquid form, it is possible to imbue electro-optic ability to highly miniaturized slot structures. Organic polymer materials are also vastly cheaper to manufacture in comparison to growing exotic crystals that are prone to contamination and further must be sliced into thin wafers. Our Company believes that the combination of less expensive manufacturing cost, ease of application, and better scalability, together with a lower cost of ownership due to marked less heat dissipation (requiring less cooling), will create enormous demand for our products. 

The following chart describes some of the characteristics of crystalline materials and electro-optical polymers.


Inorganic Crystalline Materials | Organic Polymer Systems 
Must be manufactured in strict dust-free conditions since even slight contamination can render them inoperable | Capable of being manufactured in less stringent environmental conditions. Capable of being tailored at the molecular level for optimal performance characteristics
Crystals in solid form | Can be applied as thin-film 
More expensive to manufacture | Less expensive to manufacture 
Limited to telecommunication speeds that are less than 40Gb/s (40 billion digital bits of data per second) | Open molecular architecture allows for ability to alter and improve performance indefinitely. 
Lithium niobate devices require large power levels (modulation drive voltages) to operate and are large in size -- typically measuring about four inches long compared to most integrated circuits that are literally invisible to the naked eye. | Require significantly lower power levels, up to 60% less (modulation drive voltages) to operate and cancan be used in miniaturized devices 
Requires more elaborate, expensive mechanical packaging (housings) generally comprised of materials, such as gold-plated Kovar, in order to assure operational integrity over required time and operating temperature ranges | Currently designing packaging requirements for prototype devices and anticipate the possibility of less expensive packaging. 


Many companies early attempts at developing commercially reliable organic polymers were stymied due to the difficulty of creating organic molecules that could remain electro-optically active after being subjected to the high heat of semiconductor manufacturing temperatures (CMOS). These early attempts also encountered difficulty synthesizing materials that could withstand photochemical bleaching (loss of sensitivity to specific frequencies) and material degradation due to high operating temperatures.

Over the last several years, our Company has made various scientific breakthroughs that have allowed for the synthesis of proprietary organic polymer materials that can withstand extremely high process temperatures of 1750C. Additionally, these materials have demonstrated photochemical stability, even after being subjected to tensor light for over 4,000 hours and exhibited little electro optic degradation even after 2,500 hours of continuous exposure to temperatures at 1100C  exceeding typical commercial operating temperatures of approximately 850C, as found in data center applications. After successfully achieving material test results that either met or exceeded commercial requirements (subsequently confirmed by an outside entity), in late 2016, the Company began production of its first photonic prototype device, a ridge waveguide modulator.

Our First Product  The Ridge Waveguide Modulator 


3


A ridge waveguide modulator is a type of modulator where the waveguide is fabricated within a layer of our electro-optic polymer system. Various cladding materials and electrodes are layered over the core polymer. 

Initially, we fabricated our ridge waveguide modulator to prove the viability of our materials and anticipated that the initial prototype alpha would target the specific OC-48 niche in the telecommunications market operating at 2.5 Gbps. However, our initial prototype demonstrated significantly better potential data rates, which lead us to believe that further refinements to the design could not only address the telecommunications market operating at 2.5 Gbps, but also address certain segments of both the data communications and cloud computing markets. Subsequently, further testing of our electro-optic polymer material conducted by a third-party testing equipment firm indicated that our material could operate at 25 Gbps or higher with further optimization. 

A 25 Gbps data rate would allow us to squarely address the 100 Gbps modulator market (composed of transceiver designs that multiplex 4 signals at 25 Gbps together to reach 100 Gbps), which is not only experiencing the greatest market demand today, but is expected to maintain this demand as a key node in data communication performance levels. We believe that the smaller footprint of our ridge waveguide modulator (compared to currently installed inorganic-enabled legacy devices), along with lower potential drive voltage and other undisclosed features, will enable our Company to garner significant market share across the entire telecommunications, data communications and data center value chain. 

On December 27, 2016 we announced that our first prototype alpha was 10 Gbps capable (four times faster than our initial anticipated rate), and had achieved 3dB bandwidths of up to 20GHz. These performance achievements not only confirmed that our ridge waveguide modulator is capable of 10 Gbps, but with fine-tuning device parameters, that it is capable of 25 Gbps in the very near future. The key to the performance increase at 10 Gbps was attention to utilizing our high performance organic polymers into a robust fabrication design as a ridge waveguide modulator. 

While our initial focus is to address data communications and telecommunications network applications along with cloud computing/data center needs, we believe that in the future we will have additional opportunities to address other applications such as: backplane optical interconnects, photovoltaic cells, medical applications, satellite reconnaissance, navigation systems, radar applications, optical filters, spatial light modulators; and all-optical switches.

Electro-Optic Polymer Production  Our Approach vs. the BLA Approach

Our Electro-Optic Material Approach

Our core material expertise relates to the production of high-performance, high-stability electro-optic polymers for high-speed (wide bandwidth) telecommunication and datacommunications applications. More specifically, it lies in a less mainstream, yet firmly established, scientific phenomenon called aromaticity. Aromaticity causes a high degree of molecular stability. It is a molecular arrangement wherein atoms combine into multi-membered rings and share their electrons among each other. Aromatic compounds are stable because the electronic charge distributes evenly over a great area preventing hostile moieties, such as oxygen and free radicals, from finding an opening to attack. 
Previous and Current Competitive Organic Electro-Optic Polymer Efforts

For the past several decades, diverse corporate interests, including, to our knowledge, IBM, Lockheed Martin, DuPont, AT&T Bell Labs, Honeywell and 3M, as well as numerous universities and U.S. Government Agencies, have been attempted to produce high-performance, high-stability electro-optic polymers for high-speed (wide bandwidth) telecommunication applications. These efforts were largely unsuccessful due, in our opinion, to the industry's singular adherence to an industry pervasive engineering model known as the Bond Length Alternation ("BLA") theory model, which none of our patented molecular designs rely upon. The BLA model, like all other current industry-standard molecular designs, consists of molecular designs containing long strings of atoms called polyene chains. Longer polyene chains provide higher electro-optic performance, but are also more susceptible to environmental threats, which result in unacceptably low-performing, thermally unstable electro-optic polymers. 


4


As a result, high frequency modulators engineered with electro-optic polymers designed on the BLA model or any other polyene chain design models are unstable over typical operating temperature ranges, and often exhibit performance degradation within days, hours or even minutes. Similarly, lower frequency modulators exhibit comparable failings, but to a lesser extent. These flaws, in most cases, have prevented commercial quality polymer-based modulators operating at 10-40Gb/s from entering the commercial marketplace. The thermal stability of these devices does not generally meet the minimum Telcordia GR-468 operating temperature range (-40 degrees Celsius to +85 degrees Celsius) much less the more harsh MILSPEC 883D (military specification) range of -55 degrees Celsius to 150 degrees Celsius. While many new applications do not require full military specifications for polymers, many potential customers prefer to see polymer operate at or near these conditions to convey confidence in the material system. We understand from conversations with data center customers that the temperature specifications that our materials achieve are compliant with their equipment design needs. 

We are aware of other academic and commercial development effortssome by larger companies with vastly more financial resources than we possess. However, we believe that no one yet has developed organic polymer materials that have demonstrated the combination of thermal stability, photochemical stability that can meet or exceed commercial specifications.

Our Electro-Optic Photonic P2ICTM Device Approach

Our electro-optic devices are built around our proprietary organic polymer material systems that we believe will enable better performance than the current embedded legacy technology built around inorganic materials. We also believe that the inherent flexibility of being able to apply our organic polymer materials in liquid thin-film form will accelerate the move toward ultra-miniaturization of Polymer Photonic Integrated Circuits (P2ICTM) by increasing the number of photonic circuits on a single chip. Polymer photonics (previously referred in industry as silicon organic hybrid (SOH)) is the application of polymers on to a platform such as silicon where there are both active and passive photonic component designs. In polymer photonics, polymer devices such as modulators, waveguides, and multiplexers can be fabricated on to a silicon platform that acts as a package as well as a base for mounting lasers (which are needed to source the light). 

Our initial device, a ridge waveguide modulator, though highly miniaturized utilizes conventional design and fabrication techniques in the industry. Our future devices will utilize silicon photonics (SiP) technology, which can support highly miniaturized slot waveguides structures etched in large format, low cost, and less expensive silicon wafers coated with our organic electro-optic polymers. The low-cost structure compares well to compound semiconductor technologies such as GaAs (Gallium arsenide) and InP (Indium Phosphide), which suffer from small format wafers that do not allow the economies of scale in high volume fabrication plants. The degree of miniaturization possible of the slot modulator using SiP is not technically feasible to accomplish with inorganic crystalline materials. Although this may not always remain the case, presently there are nearly insurmountable technical difficulties that are inherent to a crystalline molecule. 

Although we believe that our polymers will be the key differentiating factor in Polymer photonic devices, we do not currently possess the technical skills and instrumentation necessary to fabricate and test PICs at this dramatically reduced scale and intends to seek an external partner to assist with development. 

Our Intellectual Property

Our research and development efforts over the last 10 years have yielded our Company an extensive patent portfolio as well as critical trade secrets, unpatented technology and proprietary knowledge related to our optical materials. We currently have 25 granted patents and 3 pending patents issued or filed throughout the world, including the United States, the European Union, Australia, Canada, China and Japan that are in the field of nonlinear optic chromophore design as follows:

· | Stable Free Radical Chromophores, processes for preparing the same 
· | Stable Free Radical Chromophores, processes for preparing the same 
· | Tricyclic Spacer Systems for Nonlinear Optical Devices 
· | Anti-Aromatic Chromophore Architectures 
· | Heterocyclical Anti-Aromatic Chromophore Architectures 
· | Heterocyclical Chromophore Architectures 
· | Heterocyclical Chromophore Architectures with Novel Electronic Acceptor Systems

Our strategic plan is to utilize our core proprietary technology and leverage our proprietary optical materials to be the core of and the enabling technology for future generations of optical devices, modules, sub-systems and systems that we will develop or potentially out-license to electro-optic device manufacturers. Our Company contemplates future applications that may address the needs of semiconductor companies, aerospace companies and government agencies.

We rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our technologies. Further, employees are required to surrender any inventions or intellectual property developed as part of their employment agreements. We also have a policy of requiring prospective business partners to enter into non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) before disclosure of any of our confidential or proprietary information. Our Company can make no assurances that we will be able to effectively protect our technologies and know-how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technologies and know-how independently.

The anti-aromatic nature of these structures dramatically improves the "zwitterionic-aromatic push-pull" of the systems, providing for low energy charge transfer. Low energy charge transfer is important for the production of extremely high electro-optic character.

Heterocyclical Steric Hindering System This patent describes a nitrogenous heterocyclical structure for the integration of steric hindering groups that are necessary for the nanoscale material integration. Due to the [pi]-orbital configuration of the nitrogen bridge, this structure has been demonstrated not to interfere with the conductive nature of the electronic conductive pathway and thus is non-disruptive to the electro-optic character of the core molecular construction. The quantum mechanical design of the system is designed to establish complete molecular planarity (flatness) for optimal performance.
Totally Integrated Material Engineering System This patent covers material integration structures under a design strategy known as Totally Integrated Material Engineering. These integration structures provide for the "wrapping" of the core molecule in sterically hindering groups that maximally protect the molecule from environmental threats and maximally protect it from microscopic aggregation (which is a major cause of performance degradation and optical loss) within a minimal molecular volume. These structures also provide for the integration of polymerizable groups for integration of materials into a highly stable cross-linked material matrix.
Our Recent Significant Events and Milestones Achieved

In November 2013, preliminary testing and initial data on our SOH/polymer photonic slot waveguide modulators demonstrated several promising characteristics. The tested SOH/polymer photonics chip had a 1-millimeter square footprint, enabling the possibility of sophisticated integrated optical circuits on a single silicon substrate. In addition, the waveguide structure was approximately 1/20 the length of a typical inorganic-based silicon photonics modulator waveguide. With the combination of our proprietary electro-optic polymer material and the extremely high optical field concentration in the slot waveguide modulator, the test modulators demonstrated less than 2.2 volts to operate. Initial speeds exceeded 30-35 GhZ in the telecom, 1550 nanometer frequency band. This is equivalent to four, 10Gb/sec, inorganic, lithium niobate modulators that would require approximately 12-16 volts to move the same amount of information. Our material also operates in the 1310 nanometer frequency band, which is suitable for data communications applications.

In January 2014 we created a new methodology to combine multiple chromophores into a single polymer host that significantly improves their ability to generate more powerful organic, nonlinear electro-optical polymer systems. The new synthetic chemistry process can enable multiple chromophores (dyes) to work in concert with each other within a single polymer host. This proprietary process has created two new material systems, which have demonstrated outstanding electro-optic values. In addition, we now have a significant amount of data on the thermal aging of our materials. We have demonstrated that our materials can withstand more than 2,000 hours at 110 degrees C with little to no change in electro-optic activity in our materials, which is a significant milestone. To our knowledge, this is something that has not been achieved before in any polymer. We are also concurrently coating prototype waveguides with our proprietary material system.

In February 2014 we received our first purchase order for our advanced organic nonlinear electro-optic polymer from Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) of Boulder, Colorado in connection with the development of a next generation LADAR system. 


6


In April 2014 we entered into a sole worldwide license agreement with Corning Incorporated enabling us to integrate Corning's organic electro-optical chromophores into our portfolio of electro-optic polymer materials. The agreement allows us to use the licensed patents within a defined license field that includes communications, computing, power, and power storage applications utilizing the nonlinear optical properties of their materials. 

In October 2014 we submitted an order with Reynard Corporation to produce gold-layered fused silica substrates for our bleached waveguide modulators to be coated with several of our organic electro-optical polymers, which we received in early November 2014 and performance tested throughout December 2014. In May, 2015, we subsequently decided to eliminate this product from our commercial development plans due to its limited commercial value, low speed characteristics, difficulty to mass-produce and limited ability to integrate with existing architectures. In lieu of this development program, a commercially viable prototype ridge waveguide modulator program was started to replace the bleached waveguide development. We believe that the ridge waveguide modulator represents a viable telecom device opportunity for the Company that does not have the inherent limitations seen in bleached waveguide structures.

In May 2015 we achieved operating capability of our in-house Class 100 Clean Room where we conduct thin film processing and complete the development of prototype photonic devices enabled by our advanced organic electro-optic polymer material systems in a timelier manner. Additionally, the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA) certified some of our employees, which allows us access to JILAs world-class semiconductor facility located at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Access to this facility provides us with better control over the quality of our development work and the speed at which it progresses. 

In August 2015 we completed 2,500 hours of thermal aging tests of several blends of materials created by our multi-chromophore process, which included lengthy exposure to high temperatures (850C and 1100C). The data collected indicated minimal loss of electro-optical activity (R33) of our materials, which means that our organic polymers are expected to provide decades of operational performance. These results exceed previously published efforts for other organic polymers and are an important part of our commercialization effort as we begin to implement these material systems into advanced photonic devices for the telecom and datacom markets. 

Additionally, in August 2015, we completed 500+ hours of photochemical stability testing of our material candidates by exposing them to the visible light spectrum. The data collected indicated no discernible change in the chemical structures in an oxygen free environment. This stability testing was begun to help us understand more clearly the processing and manufacturing requirements of our future commercial products, and provide initial assurances to expect the same results as we move these materials into actual photonic device structures. This, in turn, has enabled us to begin initial device testing on devices that utilize our silicon photonic chips.

In October 2015, we successfully surpassed 2,000 hours of photochemical stability testing of our material candidates with little to no change in the electro-optic characteristics (R33) of our material; and, in January 2016, we successfully surpassed 4,000 hours of photochemical stability testing of our material candidates with little to no change in the electro-optic characteristics (R33) of our material. These photochemical stability test results, along with the thermal stability at 110°C, should enable our Company to demonstrate that organic polymers can compete head-to-head with inorganic crystalline legacy telecom and datacom devices which currently provide the backbone for the entire infrastructure that converts almost incalculable amounts of electronic (binary) data into pulses of light and back on a daily basis.

In November of 2015, we successfully fabricated ridge waveguide structures from our core material system. At the same time we successfully developed a proprietary methodology to segment individual chips from our silicon wafers that contain our ridge waveguide devices. These critical steps in our process provide us with a clear path towards a commercial telecommunication device. These same processes can be used for the fabrication of modulators to be used in data centers. The individual chips are now being analyzed and passively tested in our Longmont, CO optical test facility. 

In February 2016, we successfully guided laser single-mode light through 16 of our passive ridge waveguides made entirely out of our advanced organic polymer systems, which are the building block of waveguide modulators that can achieve high modulator performance. As a result, our commercialization effort has entered the next phases of development: passive-waveguide loss measurements, followed by the development and active testing of electro-optic modulators. Utilizing continuous-wave input laser light, electro-optic modulators convert digital (binary) electrical data into output pulses of light that can be transported across fiber optic communication networks. Active testing is accomplished by applying an electrical signal to a modulator and evaluating the resulting output optical signal.

In April 2016, we successfully achieved modulation of light in our first in-house all-polymer ridge waveguide modulator prototype. This important step towards commercialization proved that our proprietary organic electro-optic polymer systems could modulate light in an in-house designed and produced polymer ridge waveguide modulator. We expect this significant achievement to eventually lead to high-speed, low input voltage modulators capable of penetrating the current market. We are still testing and modifying the poling profiles in prototype devices to duplicate the results seen in previous Teng-Man R33 material testing.

In May 2016, we broadened our photonic device development to include our new P2IC (Polymer Photonics Integrated Circuit) design platform. The P2IC design platform utilizes high-speed ridge waveguide and slot waveguide modulator designs that scale up in performance as well as down in cost structure. Furthermore, the Lightwave Logic P2IC design platform combines the best of Polymer Photonics with the best of Silicon Photonics (SiP) to create a powerful, yet scalable platform that addresses the desires of both the telecom and datacom industries. 
 
In August 2016, we gained enormous industry exposure for our first organic electro-optic polymer-enabled prototype photonic device when our board member, Michael Lebby, Ph.D., presented to the Prestigious European Conference on Optical Communication (ECOC) Exhibition, the scientific and economic case for our Company's high-performance polymer photonics for next-generation photonic integrated circuits as future competition for installed legacy photonic devices and emerging silicon photonic systems.
 
In August 2016, we obtained highly successful independent third party verification of our organic polymer thin film properties from Metricon, a Company that specializes in making precision instruments designed to obtain optical measurements on thin film materials and optical waveguides. Metricon concluded a battery of scientific tests to verify the inherent properties of several of our advanced organic electro-optic polymer materials, which are currently being implemented into a series of photonic devices. Measurements by Metricon of several planar waveguide samples determined that our polymer thin film materials at 1550 nm (Telecom frequency band) should exceed industry requirements that target overall device loss at <4 dB/cm. Additionally, Metricon was also able to provide very accurate refractive index measurements on our Companys materials, which is very important for designing high-speed multi-layer polymer modulators.

In December 2016, we achieved high-speed modulation in our first all-organic polymer ridge waveguide intensity modulator prototype, which constituted one of the most significant moments in the history of our Company. Our initial "alpha" prototype device, enabled by our P2IC polymer system, demonstrated bandwidth suitable for data rates up to about 10 Gbps. This performance exceeds the telecom OC-48 standard (2.5 Gbps). This device demonstrated true amplitude (intensity) modulation in a Mach-Zehnder modulator structure incorporating our polymer waveguides. Presently, we are continuing to move towards extending our initial "alpha" prototype device to operate up to 25 Gbps, which is important to the optical networking industry because this data rate is a major node to achieve 100 Gbps (using 4 channels of 25 Gbps). 

As we move forward through 2017, we expect to (i) bring in-house more specific skill sets in materials engineering and in device testing and fabrication, as well as personnel to orchestrate our various Company activities; and (ii) attract an industry partner with the synergistic capabilities necessary to help develop future products that are in various stages of design, such as a slot waveguide modulator and our integrated fiber optic polymer-based transceiver.

The Photonic Device Market 

General

Photonic devices such as fiber-optic modulators translate electric signals into optical signals and optical signals back into electrical signals. Such devices are used in communication systems to transfer data over fiber-optic networks. Optical data transfer is significantly faster and more efficient than transfer technologies using only electric signals, permitting more cost-effective use of bandwidth for broadband Internet and voice services.

Two distinct technologies currently exist for the fabrication of fiber-optic devices, such as fiber-optic modulators. The first, which is the more traditional technology, utilizes an electro-optically active inorganic core crystalline material (e.g. lithium niobate and indium phosphide). The second, which is the focus of the Companys research and development, involves the exploitation of electro-optic polymers.

Our Target Markets

Cloud computing and data centers

Big data is a general term used to describe the voluminous amount of unstructured and semi-structured data a Company creates -- data that would take too much time and cost too much money to load into a relational database for analysis. Companies are looking to cloud computing in their data centers to access all the data. Inherent speed and bandwidth limits of traditional solutions and the potential of organic polymer devices offer an opportunity to increase the bandwidth, reduce costs and improve speed of access.

While the number of data centers is declining, the overall square footage has been growing rapidly. Data centers are confronted with the problem of moving vast amounts of data not only around the data center itself, but also between data centers. The size of these data center links are often measured in kilometers and employ optical modulators to convert stored electrical/binary information to optical and back. Links that are shorter than 500 meters can employ direct modulation, which accomplishes modulation by mechanically turning a laser on and off. However, for links greater than 500 meters, it is necessary to employ optical modulators. We intend to target optical devices that are aimed at the 500m to 10km distance segment of the market. These are single mode fiber links and require polymer optical devices that operate in single optical mode. While some data center customers are planning their architectures using single mode fiber links even below 500m, others are focusing on cost-performance to make their decisions for their particular architectures. Our technology is both single mode and scalable, which means that it can be implemented in either data center application depending on how we achieve the customer metrics and specifications. We believe that our single mode modulator solutions will not only be competitive at 500m to 10km link distances, but also at distances below 500m depending on the customer architecture designs. 

Telecommunications/Data Communications

The telecommunications industry has evolved from transporting traditional analogue voice data over copper wire into the movement of digital voice and data. Telecommunication companies are faced with the enormous increasing challenges to keep up with the resulting tremendous explosion in demand for bandwidth. This has been further exacerbated by a recent trend for content providers to store large amounts of data closer to the end user. This results in enormous demands on telecommunication metro networks (less than 10 Kilometers in length) and their ability to facilitate the transportation of content. 

We believe that our ridge waveguide modulator, when completed will have the potential to address several segments within telecommunications networks.

Our Business Strategy

Our business strategy anticipates that our revenue stream will be derived from one or some combination of the following: (i) technology licensing for specific product application; (ii) joint venture relationships with significant industry leaders; or (iii) the production and direct sale of our own electro-optic device components. Our objective is to be a leading provider of proprietary technology and know-how in the electro-optic device market. In order to meet this objective, we intend to:

· | Further the development of proprietary organic electro-optic polymer material systems 
· | Develop photonic devices based on our P2ICTM technology 
· | Continue to develop proprietary intellectual property 
· | Continue to add device development capabilities 
· | Continue to add to material development capabilities 
· | Maintain/develop strategic relationships with major telecommunications and data communications companies to further the awareness and commercialization of our technology.
· | Continue to add high-level science and technology personnel in key areas of our materials and device development programs.

Create Organic Polymer-Enabled Electro-Optic Modulators

We intend to utilize our proprietary optical polymer technology to create an initial portfolio of commercially feasible electro-optic polymer product devices and applications for various markets, including telecommunications, data communications and data centers. 

We expect our initial product device line will be a high-speed 4 x 25 Gbps ridge waveguide modulator to compete in the growing 100 Gbps modulator market.

Continue to Expand Our Intellectual Property Portfolio and Reliance on Trade Secrets

We plan to continuously advance the development of unique organic electro-optic polymer materials along with proprietary designs and device configurations. We intend to protect our technology by filing patent applications where appropriate or by obtaining exclusive technology rights where available. However, in some cases, we will refrain from protecting certain proprietary with patents in favor of trade secrets.
Maintain/Develop Strategic Relationships Private Firms, and Academic Institutions

Since the formation of our Company, we have had numerous strategic relationships with government agencies that have provided us with funding and access to important technology. From the time that we developed our own in-house testing capability and Class 100 clean room facility in Longmont, Colorado we have attempted to minimize outside academic and government agency relationships.

After completion of our initial prototype ridge waveguide, we will seek to enter into partnership/JV discussions with outside parties to co-develop a slot waveguide modulator.

Continue to utilize outside consultants to gain technical expertise

In December 2011, we retained Dr. Frederick Leonberger, PhD as our Senior Advisor. Dr. Leonberger is the former Chief Technology Officer of JDS Uniphase, Inc. We previously retained EOvation Advisors LLC, a technology and business advisory firm founded by Dr. Frederick Leonberger, as a consultant to the Company. Dr. Leonberger is presently assisting our Company with strategic planning and the design of optical modulators that we intend to develop. Starting January 2013, Dr. Leonberger also serves as an advisor to our Board of Directors.

Our Research and Development Process

Our research and development process consists of the following steps:


· | We develop novel polymer materials utilizing our patented and patent pending technology to meet certain performance specifications. We then develop methods to synthesize larger quantities of such material. 
· | We conduct a full battery of tests at the completion of the synthesis of each new polymer material to evaluate its characteristics. We also create development strategies to optimize materials to meet specifications for specific applications. We model and simulate each new polymer material so that we can further understand how to optimize the material for device operation.
· | We integrate data from the material characterization and test results to fabricate devices. We analyze device-testing results to refine and improve fabrication processes and methods. In addition, we investigate alternative material and design variations to possibly create more efficient fabrication processes. 
· | We create an initial device design using simulation software. Following device fabrication, we run a series of optical and electronic tests on the device. 


We have and expect to continue to make significant operating and capital expenditures for research and development. Our research and development expenses were $2,474,689 and $2,825,099 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Our Proprietary Products in Development

As part of a two-pronged marketing strategy, our Company is developing several optical devices, which are in various stages of development and that utilize our organic nonlinear optical materials. They include:
Ridge Waveguide Modulator

Our ridge electro-optic waveguide modulator was designed and fabricated in our Longmont, Colorado laboratory. The fabrication of our first in-house device is significant to our entire device program and is an important starting point for modulators that are being developed for target markets. We have multiple generations of new materials that we will soon be optimizing for this specific design. On December 27, 2016, we announced that our initial alpha prototype ridge waveguide modulator, enabled by our P2IC polymer system, demonstrated bandwidth suitable for data rates up to about 10 Gbps, which exceeds the telecom OC-48 standard (2.5 Gbps). 

This device demonstrated true amplitude (intensity) modulation in a Mach-Zehnder modulator structure incorporating our polymer waveguides. Presently, we are continuing to move towards extending our initial alpha prototype device to operate up to 25 Gbps, which is important to the optical networking industry because this data rate is a major node to achieve 100 Gbps (using 4 channels of 25 Gbps). 

The ridge waveguide modulator represents our first commercially viable device, and targets metro networks (< 10Km) within large scale telecommunications and data communications networks and represents approximately a $300MM per year market opportunity for us. 

Slot Waveguide Modulator

Our functional polymer photonics slot waveguide modulator utilizes an existing modulator structure with one of our proprietary electro-optic polymer material systems as the enabling material layer, and is functional as an operating prototype device. 

Preliminary testing and initial data on our polymer photonics slot waveguide modulators demonstrated several promising characteristics. The tested polymer photonic chip had a 1-millimeter square footprint, enabling the possibility of sophisticated integrated optical circuits on a single silicon substrate. In addition, the waveguide structure was approximately 1/20 the length of a typical inorganic-based silicon photonics modulator waveguide. 

With the combination of our proprietary electro-optic polymer material and the extremely high optical field concentration in the slot waveguide modulator, the test modulators demonstrated less than 2.2 volts to operate. Initial speeds exceeded 30-35 GhZ in the telecom, 1550 nanometer frequency band. This is equivalent to four, 10Gb/sec, inorganic, lithium niobate modulators that would require approximately 12-16 volts to move the same amount of information. 

Our material also operates in the 1550 nanometer frequency band, which is suitable for data communications applications. We continued with our collaborative development of our SOH/ Polymer photonic slot waveguide modulator in 2014 and continued our collaboration with an associated third party research group through 2016.

Our Long-Term Device Development Goal - Multichannel Integrated Nanophotonic Transceiver

While we consider our ridge waveguide and slot waveguide modulators currently under development to be commercially viable products, in another sense they are intermediate steps in the development of our long-term goal a multichannel integrated nanophotonic transceiver for application in data communications. 

The transceiver consists of a silicon photonic chip fabricated with nonlinear polymer infused modulators (polymer photonic), multiplexers, demultiplexers, detectors and grating fiber couplers to an external light source. The CMOS-compatible optical modulators are key components for future silicon-based photonic transceivers. Our solution, the silicon-organic hybrid (polymer photonic) platform has been proposed and is being prototyped. In the polymer photonic approach, the optical signal is guided by a silicon waveguide while an organic cladding provides the electro-optic effect.

Other Potential Applications for Our Products

We believe that there are myriad potential applications for our organic polymer materials and devices outside of our initial focus of data communications, telecommunications and data centers. These potential applications encompass areas as diverse as military, space, optical computing, and life sciences. We believe that as viable organic polymer materials gain acceptance, their increased flexibility, functionality and low cost will create new applications that may not yet be technically feasible. Two such future applications with revolutionary potential are:
 All-Optical Switches

An all-optical switch is one that enables signals in optical fibers or networks to be selectively switched from one fiber or circuit to another. Many device designs have been developed and commercialized in todays telecom networks to effect optical switching by using mechanical or electrical control elements to accomplish the switching event. Future networks will require all-optical switches that can be more rapidly activated with a low energy and short duration optical (light) control pulse. 

Multi-Channel Optical Modem

The availability of low cost electro-optic modulators will enable low cost multichannel optical modems that will use many wavelengths in parallel and employ high efficiency modulation techniques such as QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation). Such modems would enable an order of magnitude increase in the Internet capacity of legacy fiber. Our Company is in the early feasibility stage of such a multichannel optical modem.
Our Past Government Program Participation

Our Company has been a participant in several vital government sponsored research and development programs with various government agencies that protect the interests of our country. The following is a list of some of the various divisions of government agencies that have provided us with advisory, financial and/or materials support in the pursuit of high-speed electro-optic materials. We are not currently partnered with, strategically related to, or financially supported by any governmental agency at this time, however, we may explore future opportunities as our Company grows and gains the additional resources and personnel necessary to support these efforts. Our previous relationships included:

· | National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) 
· | Properties Branch of the Army Research Laboratory on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Aberdeen, Maryland.
· | Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA) 
· | Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division in China Lake, California 
· | Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio 

Our Competition

The markets we are targeting for our electro-optic polymer technology are intensely competitive. Among the largest fiber-optic component manufactures are Finisar, JDSU, Oclaro, NeoPhotonics, OpLink, CyOptics. Additionally, the five largest inorganic modulator component manufacturers hold approximately 85% of the electro-optic modulator component market. They are JDSU, Sumitomo, Oclaro, Fujitsu and ThorLabs. These companies are heavily invested in the production of crystalline-based electro-optic modulator technologies, as well as the development of novel manufacturing techniques and modulator designs.

GigPeak, Inc. may be considered our primary polymer competitor. They design and have patented potentially commercially feasible electro-optic polymers and hold an exclusive license to all electro-optic polymeric technology developed at the University of Washington. GigPeak presently has a joint venture with CPqD, an independent Brazil institution. GigPeak has sold a majority interest of their polymer IP to BrPhotonics S/A based in Brazil. Recently, GigPeak announced that it signed an agreement for Integrated Device Technology, Inc. (IDT) to acquire GigPeak. We do not know at this time what IDTs intention is regarding polymer technology.

We believe that as our organic polymer technology gains industry acceptance, we will be poised to obtain a significant portion of the component manufacturing market. Electro-optic polymers demonstrate several advantages over other technologies, such as inorganic-based technologies, due to their reduced manufacturing and processing costs, higher performance and lower power requirements. Our patented organic polymers and future electro-optic photonic devices have demonstrated significant stability advantages over our known competitor's materials.

We believe the principal competitive factors in our target markets are:


· | The ability to develop and commercialize highly stable optical polymer-based materials and optical devices in commercial quantities.
· | The ability to obtain appropriate patent and proprietary rights protection. 
· | Lower cost, high production yield for these products. 
· | The ability to enable integration and implement advanced technologies. 
· | Strong sales and marketing, and distribution channels for access to products. 


We believe that our current business planning will position our Company to compete adequately with respect to these factors. Our future success is difficult to predict because we are an early stage company with all of our potential products still in development.

Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial, scientific, marketing and human resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may:


· | Succeed in developing products that are equal to or superior to our potential products or that achieve greater market acceptance than our potential products. 
· | Devote greater resources to developing, marketing or selling their products. 
· | Respond quickly to new or emerging technologies or scientific advances and changes in customer requirements, which could render our technologies or potential products obsolete.
· | Introduce products that make the continued development of our potential products uneconomical. 
· | Obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to develop and commercialize our potential products. 
· | Withstand price competition more successfully than we can. 
· | Establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our prospective customers. 
· | Take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.
