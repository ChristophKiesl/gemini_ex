Item 1. Business
 
Creative Medical Technologies Holdings, Inc. is a commercial stage biotechnology company focused on immunology, urology, orthopedics and neurology using adult stem cell treatments. We were incorporated on December 3, 1998, in the State of Nevada under the name Jolley Marketing, Inc. On May 18, 2016, we completed a reverse merger transaction under which Creative Medical Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“CMT”) became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Creative Medical Health, Inc. (“CMH”), which was CMT’s sole stockholder prior to the merger, became our principal stockholder. In connection with this merger, we changed our name to Creative Medical Technologies Holdings, Inc. to reflect our current business. 
 
CMT was originally created as the urological arm of CMH to monetize a patent and related intellectual property related to the treatment of erectile dysfunction (“ED”), which it acquired from CMH in February 2016. Subsequently, we have expanded our development and acquisition of intellectual property beyond urology to include therapeutic treatments utilizing “re-programmed” stem cells, and the treatment of neurologic disorders, lower back pain and liver disease using various types of stem cells through our ImmCelz, Inc., AmnioStem LLC and StemSpine, LLC subsidiaries. However, neither ImmCelz LLC, AmnioStem LLC nor StemSpine LLC have commenced commercial activities.
 
We currently conduct substantially all of our commercial operations through CMT. CMT markets and sells our CaverStem® and FemCelz® disposable kits utilized by physicians to perform autologous procedures that treat erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction, respectively. Our CaverStem® and FemCelz® kits are currently available through physicians at 14 locations in the United States and Europe.
 
In 2020, we formed ImmCelz, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of CMT. Through our ImmCelz Inc. subsidiary, we began exploring the development of treatments that utilize a patient’s own extracted immune cells that are then "reprogrammed" by culturing them outside the patient’s body with optimized stem cells. The immune cells are then re-injecting into the patient from whom they were extracted. We believe this process endows the immune cells with regenerative properties that may be suitable for the treatment of stroke victims. In contrast to other stem cell-based approaches, the immune cells are significantly smaller in size than stem cells and are believed to more effectively penetrate areas of the damaged tissues and induce regeneration.
 
We are currently primarily focused on expanding the commercial sale and use of CaverStem® and FemCelz® by physicians in the Unites States, Europe and South America, commercializing our StemSpine® treatment for lower back pain and filing an Innovative New Drug (IND) application to the FDA utilizing our ImmCelz technology platform to treat stroke. In the future, subject to the availability of capital, we will seek to further develop additional therapeutic products that utilize our proprietary intellectual property. 
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 211 E Osborn Road, Phoenix, AZ 85012.
 
Our Products
 
CaverStem® - Erectile Dysfunction Treatment
 
CaverStem® is a clinically proven, patented procedure that utilizes a patient’s own stem cells to treat ED. The procedure has been demonstrated safe and effective in clinical trials.
 
The CaverStem® stem cell treatment consists of a one-hour out-patient visit in a physician’s office. The physician harvests a patient’s stem cells from bone marrow in the hip using a local anesthetic. The extraction device is designed to harvest only the stem cells, while filtering out the red blood cells, thereby eliminating the need for any centrifugation. The stem cells are then injected into the patient’s corpus cavernosum (erectile tissue) to stimulate muscle and blood vessel regeneration. Clinical research data concludes that our CaverStem® treatment results in a marked increase in duration and frequency of erections and the ability to sustain erections until orgasm, with no known treatment-associated adverse events.
 
We generate revenues through the sale of disposable bone marrow aspiration kits to physicians who use the kits to perform the CaverStem® procedure. We contract with physicians to purchase kits and, in turn, provide exclusivity in their market through our patent protection, marketing support and training. We also have an exclusive distribution contract for the bone marrow aspiration kits for urological indications from the manufacturer. This eliminates the potential for physicians to go directly to the manufacturer.
 
On February 2, 2016, the Company entered into a Patent Purchase Agreement with CMH pursuant to which CMH assigned the Company its rights to US Patent No. 8,372,797, entitled “Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction by Stem Cell Therapy” which was issued to CMH by the USPTO on February 12, 2013, and related know-how and technology. The closing of the Patent Purchase Agreement occurred in May 2016, and we issued 64,666,667 shares of CMT’s common stock to CMH. In August 2017, CMT filed the CaverStem® trademark No. 87556834 with the USPTO. In June 2018 the trademark was granted to CMT. In November 2018, the Company entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with our stem cell harvest device manufacturer for the exclusive worldwide distribution rights for urological indications.
 
While previous studies have demonstrated that stem cells can enhance blood vessel function, this patent application was the first to demonstrate that administration of stem cells can lead to enhanced erections. This procedure has been demonstrated safe and effective in clinical trials.
 
In August 2017, we completed recruitment on a clinical trial of the CaverStem® procedure conducted by the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Following completion of recruitment and treatment of the study subjects, an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) overseeing the study validated the procedure as safe. In the same time frame, other worldwide, peer-reviewed and published clinical trials using the same procedure validated the efficacy of the ED treatment. As a result of these two developments, management concluded the CaverStem® procedure is both safe and effective and commenced marketing activities in November of 2017. From November 2017, through September 2019, the data from 40 patients in the clinical trial was combined with data from a 100-patient clinical registry and analyzed. The results were then submitted to the Journal of Translational Medicine for peer-review and publication. In January 2020, the results were published. The peer-reviewed results validated 100% safety and 85% efficacy of the CaverStem® procedure. This marked the largest ever study of the safety and efficacy of bone marrow stem cells used to tread erectile dysfunction.

FemCelz® - Female Sexual Function Treatment
 
In September 2018, we launched our proprietary FemCelz® procedure for the treatment of the loss of genital sensitivity and dryness experienced by women. The FemCelz® procedure uses the patient’s own stem cells to improve female sexual function, and is similar to the CaverStem® procedure. 
 
The FemCelz® stem cell treatment consists of a one-hour out-patient visit in a physician’s office. The physician harvests a patient’s stem cells from bone marrow in the hip using a local anesthetic.  The extraction device is designed to harvest only the stem cells, while filtering out the red blood cells, thereby eliminating the need for any centrifugation. The cells are then injected into the pubocervical fascia (peri-G-spot), skene’s glands, and around the peri-clitoral to stimulate muscle and blood vessel regeneration.
 
We generate revenues through the sale of disposable bone marrow aspiration kits to physicians who use the kits to perform the FemCelz® procedure. We contract with physicians to purchase kits and, in turn, provide exclusivity in their market through our patent protection, marketing support and training. We also have an exclusive distribution contract for the bone marrow aspiration kits for urological indications from the manufacturer. This eliminates the potential for physicians to go directly to the manufacturer.
 
In January 2019, CMT filed the FemCelz® trademark No. 88759133 with the USPTO. In July, 2020 the trademark was issued to the Company.
 
StemSpine® - Lower Back Pain Treatment
 
The StemSpine® procedure uses the patient’s own stem cells to treat chronic lower back pain. 
 
The StemSpine® stem cell treatment consists of a one-hour out-patient visit in a physician’s office. The physician harvests a patient’s stem cells from bone marrow in the hip using a local anesthetic. The extraction device is designed to harvest only the stem cells, while filtering out the red blood cells, thereby eliminating the need for any centrifugation. The cells are then administered into muscles surrounding the area of lower back pain, such as the psoas major muscle to stimulate blood vessel regeneration. New blood vessels increase circulation around the disc and thus stimulates regeneration of the disc.
 
Lower back pain is the single leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting mobility, functionality and the emotional state. To date, treatment options have ranged from prescription medication, to physical therapy and even acupuncture. Unfortunately, in patients whose lower back pain originates from disc degeneration, existing approved treatments do not address the underlying cause, but only symptoms.
 
Recent U.S. clinical trials using stem cells administered directly into the disc have shown promise in regenerating injured discs, and by this means reducing pain in some patients. Companies such as Mesoblast Limited and BioRestorative Therapeutics have patient follow-ups as long as three years post injection and show some degree of pain reduction and disc regeneration without adverse effects.
 
It is known that a significant number of patients suffering from lower back pain have deficient circulation in the areas surrounding the discs, which is believed by some to be the initial cause of disc degeneration. The technology developed and patented by StemSpine®, LLC utilizes biologicals to stimulate a process termed angiogenesis, which overcomes the deficient circulation causing disc degeneration.
 
In October, 2019 the Company announced the successful completion of a pilot study of the first patients with over 12+ months of data showing safety and efficacy. The has company begun commercialization of StemSpine® in the US with the launch of a new website and physician recruitment.
 
In May 2017, we formed StemSpine, LLC for the purpose of using stem cells to treat back pain under a patent we acquired from CMH. In June 2017, we filed an additional patent application covering the synergy between intradiscal stem cell injection subsequent to stimulation of perispinal angiogenesis.
 
We intend to further develop StemSpine® by building and publishing the results of a clinical registry similar to our data gathering efforts with the Caverstem® procedure. We will utilize the trial design from the pilot study as the template for the registry. We plan to recruit a limited number of physicians in key markets, provide training and support on the StemSpine® procedure, assist with patient recruitment, provide disposable kits at no cost to the physician or patient, and reimburse the physicians for their time and effort. In return, the physicians will track the results of the StemSpine® procedures and load the data onto the clinical registry. 
 
In November 2017, we filed the StemSpine® trademark No. 87690313 with the USPTO. In February, 2020 the trademark was granted to us.
 
Amniostem™ – Universal Donor Stem Cell Therapy for Stroke, Radiation and Glioma
 
The Company is in the early stages of developing treatments that utilize amniotic stem cells to treat strokes, radiation toxicity, glioma and other neurodegenerative conditions. We intend to market these treatments under the name AmnioStem™.
 
On August 25, 2016, CMT entered into a License Agreement which grants us the exclusive right to all products derived from US Patent No. 7,569,385 for multipotent amniotic fetal stem cells. This patent covers methods for identifying, isolating, expanding and differentiating a novel population of therapeutic stem cells, specifically, stem cells derived from amniotic fluid. In the scope of available stem cell technologies, this invention describes compositions of fetal-derived stem cells and methods for generating these cells that can allow for tissue regeneration without raising the ethical concerns that are inherent to embryonic/fetal-derived cell types. The source of these stem cells is amniotic fluid harvested during routine amniocentesis of pregnant women, whereby the isolated cell population is subsequently cultured and expanded to create a bank of therapeutic stem cells.
 
In February 2017, the company expanded its translational research program using its AmnioStem™ universal donor stem cell product through establishment of laboratory facilities in San Diego. The Company initiated research activities at the San Diego BioLabs facility, a biotechnology incubator sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Companies, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis, and Sanofi. During 2018, the company completed its initial research activities at BioLabs and is continuing to gather animal data in support of future Innovative New Drug (IND) filings with the FDA for either stroke, radiation toxicity or glioma therapies.

Amniostem™ - Stroke Therapy
 
On Dec. 13, 2016, we filed US patent application #62/400557 entitled “Treatment of Stroke by Amniotic Fluid Derived Stem Cell Conditioned Media and Products Derived Thereof.”. The patent application covers the use of the AmnioStem™ stem cells as a production means for generation of nanoparticles termed “exosomes,” which regenerate damaged brain tissue after stroke. This novel stem cell-based therapeutic product uses exosomes derived from stem cells as opposed to the stem cells themselves. The patent provides means of leveraging growth factors and nucleic acids generated by AmnioStem™ stem cells, in order to provide a “drug like” product that overcomes many of the hurdles associated with administration of stem cells. It is known that intravenous injection of stem cells usually results in accumulation in lungs, leading to reduced therapeutic efficacy. Concentrating and purifying regenerative factors produced by this unique stem cell type will accelerate development of this novel therapy, as well as develop combination therapies to provide the highest probability of success to patients suffering from this debilitating condition. We plan to develop both the AmnioStem™ cell and the stroke treatment technologies as a new regenerative medicine platform for use with multiple indications.
Amniostem™ - Selectively Inhibiting Growth of Glioma Brain Cancer Cells.
 
In July 2017, we announced preclinical data showing that exosomes harvested from the AmnioStem™ stem cell product, selectively inhibits growth of glioma brain cancer cells. Exosomes are nanoparticles generated by a variety of cells that are critically involved in intercellular communication. This technology represents a non-toxic biological approach that eventually may provide benefit patients with brain cancer. We have partnered with Santosh Kesari, MD, Ph.D, FANA, FAAN, Chair and Professor, Department of Translational Neurosciences and Neurotherapeutics, John Wayne Cancer Institute, as well as Director of Neuro-oncology, Providence Saint John’s Health Center and leads the Pacific Neuroscience Research Center at Pacific Neuroscience Institute to co-develop this technology. From a commercialization perspective, exosomes are simpler to manufacture, store, and deliver as compared to living cells. Additionally, since exosomes are not replicating cells, we anticipate a less complicated FDA regulatory pathway as compared to cellular based products.
ImmCelz™ - Universal Donor Stem Cell Therapy for Stroke Treatment

We are developing our ImmCelz™ technology for the treatment of stroke patients. ImmCelz™ utilizes a patient’s own extracted immune cells that are then "reprogrammed" by culturing them outside the patient’s body with optimized amniotic stem cells. The immune cells are then re-injecting into the patient from whom they were extracted. We believe this process endows the immune cells with regenerative properties that may be suitable for the treatment of stroke victims. In contrast to other stem cell-based approaches, the immune cells are significantly smaller in size than stem cells and are believed to more effectively penetrate areas of the damaged tissues and induce regeneration. 
 
We expect to complete our filing of an Innovative New Drug (IND) application with the FDA utilizing our ImmCelz technology to treat stroke in 2021. 
 
OvaStem™ - Stem Cell Therapy for Premature Ovarian Failure
 
The OvaStem™ procedure uses the patient’s own stem cells to treat female infertility. 
 
The OvaStem™ stem cell treatment consists of a one-hour out-patient visit in a physician’s office. The physician harvests a patient’s stem cells from bone marrow in the hip using a local anesthetic. The extraction device is designed to harvest only the stem cells, while filtering out the red blood cells, thereby eliminating the need for any centrifugation. The cells are then administered into dysfunctional ovaries. The introduction of stem cells into dysfunctional ovaries has been demonstrated to induce fertility, as well as restore hormone levels.
 
Studies have shown that stem cells reduce ovarian fibrosis, accelerate maturation of immature oocytes and restore growth factor production damaged by aging and cancer interventions.
 
We are also exploring the use of our technologies and/or have filed patents covering treatments for

Trademarks
 
Trademark and Trade Name. On April 14, 2015, CMH was granted a trademark by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the name “CaverStem®.” On February 23, 2016 CMH applied for a trademark for the name “Creative Medical Technologies.” Under the terms of the Patent Purchase Agreement CMH has assigned these trademarks to us.
Trademark and Trade Name. On November 18, 2017, we filed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the name “Stemspine”. The application number is 87690313. The USPTO has searched and considers the application allowable. They published it to give third parties a chance to challenge it. The Notice of Allowance occurred in June 2018.
Trademark and Trade Name. On January 2, 2019 we filed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the name “FemCelz”. The application number is 88247452. The Notice of Allowance occurred in July, 2020.  
 Trademark and Trade Name. On March 1, 2020 we filed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the name “ImmCelz”. The application number is 88829362.
 
Government Regulation
 
Human cells, tissues or cellular or tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”) intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion or transfer into a human recipient are regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) under the authority of section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”) Act under which the FDA established regulations for HCT/Ps to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases. Specifically, Section 361 states that “human cells, tissues, and cellular or tissue-based products” (HCT/Ps) are regulated solely under this section if it meets all of the following criteria: (i) minimally manipulated; (ii) for homologous use only; (iii) do not involve the combination of the cells or tissues with another articles; and (iv) are for autologous use. The FDA has recently published final guidance to the industry ( Same Surgical Procedure Exception under 21 CFR 1271.15(b) November 2017 ) that further clarifies the FDA’s position on what constitutes homologous use of HCT/Ps. The FDA in this guidance states, for the exception in 21 CFR 1271.15(b) to apply an establishment must; a) Remove and implant the HCT/Ps into the same individual from whom they were removed (autologous use); b) Implant the HCT/Ps within the same surgical procedure; and c) HCT/Ps remain in their original form, which means that they are only rinsed, cleaned, sized, or shaped in the procedure. Management believes that its CaverStem®, FemCelz®, StemSpine®, and OvaStem™ stem cell treatments are HCT/Ps that meet the criteria for inclusion under 21 CFR 1271.15(b).
 
If the FDA were to modify its regulations or significantly change their guidance, our products mentioned above could be subject to traditional premarket and post-market requirements arising under section 351 of the PHSA Act. “351 HCT/Ps” require approval of a Biologic License Application, and their manufacture must comply with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMPs”). Significant time and capital would be required to comply with these requirements.

Management expects and plans to pursue the regulatory pathway consistent with a new biological drug for our ImmCelz™ and Amniostem™ stem cell products being developed to treat, stroke, glioma and other indications. As such, we will fall under the jurisdiction of CBER. This organization regulates products under a variety of regulatory authorities including the Public Health Service Act and the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. CBER manages the BLA process which is a request for permission to introduce, or deliver for introduction, a biologic product into interstate commerce (21 CFR 601.2). This process validates safety and efficacy through animal studies, first-in-human (Phase I), Safety and initial efficacy (Phase II) and pivotal trials (Phase III).
 
Competition
 
There are a number of public and private companies engaged in stem cell research and applications for use to treat ED, lower back pain, stroke and other issues. Many of these have been engaged in this field for a significant period.
 
In the erectile dysfunction marketplace where CaverStem® is marketed, there are a few private companies engaged in stem cell research and applications. Our CaverStem® procedure is aimed at the approximately 9,000,000 men in the U.S. who, due to damage to the blood vessels and smooth muscle tissue in the penis, do not respond to PDE5 inhibitors such as Viagra or Cialis, do not respond to or cannot tolerate penis injections containing Alprostadil such as Averject or Edex, or are not one of approximately 25,000 men in the U.S. who elect invasive, non-reversible rod or pump implantation into the penis. Currently, management’s research has determined that there are fewer than a dozen private clinics in the U.S. that offer autologous stem cell treatments for erectile dysfunction. None of these firms is believed to have filed for patent protection or conducted clinical trials using bone marrow to validate safety and efficacy. By comparison, in August 2017, CMT completed recruitment on a clinical trial being conducted at UCLA by LABIOMED. Following completion of recruitment and treatment of the study subjects, an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) overseeing the study validated the procedure as safe. In the same time frame, other peer-reviewed and published clinical trials using the same procedure validated the efficacy of the erectile dysfunction treatment. As a result of these two developments, management concluded the CaverStem® erectile dysfunction procedure is both safe and effective and commenced marketing activities in November of 2017. From November of 2017 through September of 2019, the data from 40 patients in the clinical trial was combined with 100 patients in a clinical registry was analyzed and the results submitted to the Journal of Translational Medicine for peer-review and publication. In January 2020, the results were published. The peer-reviewed results validated 100% safety and 85% efficacy of the CaverStem® procedure. This marked the largest ever study of the safety and efficacy of bone marrow stem cells used to tread erectile dysfunction. Management believes that the combination of patent protection, a published clinical trial that validates our “standard of care” procedure, and competitively priced disposable kits will allow the Company to compete successfully in this marketplace. 
 
In the female sexual dysfunction marketplace where FemCelz® is marketed, there are no known companies engaged in stem cell research and applications. None of these firms is believed to have filed for patent protection or conducted clinical trials using bone marrow to validate safety and efficacy. 
 
There are a number of clinics around the US engaged in using products such as cord blood, Wharton’s jelly and adipose-derived stem cells to treat patients for a number of indications. The FDA regulations and stated positions regarding allogenic (not a patient’s own) cells, cell manipulation and homologous use have made it clear that it views these products as drugs that are required to obtain FDA marketing approval prior to use in humans. Recently, the FDA has issued orders to adipose kit manufacturers and numerous cord blood banks to discontinue distribution of their stem cell products to the general public. It is for the stated reasons above that we do not view non-compliant clinical use of the aforementioned products as competition.
 
In the marketplaces for lower back pain, stroke, and glioma, management believes little competition exists. While there is a significant body of academic research in vitro and in animal models on the benefits of treating lower back pain, stroke, and glioma with stem cells, management is not aware of any public or private U.S. firms pursuing human research or commercialization of these treatments. Based upon management’s research, there are fewer than five private clinics in the U.S. that offer any form of stem cell treatment for these indications. Therefore, it is management’s expectation that we will be the first entrant in the market space upon completion of our research and commercialization efforts.
 
Employees
 
We have no employees. However, we use and pay for the services of employees of our affiliate, CMH. We have agreed to reimburse our parent company a flat monthly rate for the time spent by their management team on our business operations.
Research and Development
 
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, totaled $0. This reflects the completion of the pre-clinical research on Amniostem™ in 2018. Pending completion of the development of the patented technology included in our license agreements, we will not have additional license fees until we have a saleable product. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, totaled $0.
