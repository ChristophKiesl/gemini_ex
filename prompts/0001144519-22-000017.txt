Core Segments
Agribusiness Segment
Overview—Our Agribusiness segment is an integrated, global business involved in purchasing, storing, transporting, processing and selling agricultural commodities and commodity products while managing risk across various value chains. The principal agricultural commodities that we handle in this segment are oilseeds, primarily soybeans, rapeseed, canola, and sunflower seed, and grains, primarily wheat and corn. We process oilseeds into vegetable oils and protein meals, principally for the food, animal feed and biofuel industries, through a global network of facilities. Our footprint is well balanced, with approximately 33% of our processing capacity located in South America, 26% in North America, 25% in Europe and 16% in Asia-Pacific.
Customers—We sell agricultural commodities and processed commodity products to customers throughout the world. The principal purchasers of our oilseeds, grains and oilseed meal are animal feed manufacturers, livestock producers, wheat and corn millers, and other oilseed processors. As a result, our agribusiness operations generally benefit from global demand for protein, primarily poultry and pork products. The principal purchasers of the unrefined vegetable oils produced in this segment are our own refined and specialty oils businesses, third-party edible oil processors, which use these oils as raw materials in the production of edible oil products for the food service, food processor and retail markets, as well as biofuel companies, which use the oil as feedstock for biofuel production. In addition, we sell oil products for various non-food uses, including the production of biofuels and industrial applications.
Distribution and Logistics—We have developed an extensive global logistics network to transport our products, including trucks, railcars, river barges and ocean freight vessels. Typically, we either lease the transportation assets or contract with third parties for these services. To better serve our customer base and develop our global distribution and logistics capabilities, we own or operate either directly or through joint venture arrangements, various port terminal facilities, including in Brazil, Argentina, the United States, Canada, Latvia, Ukraine, Poland, Vietnam and Australia.
Financial Services and Activities—We also offer various financial services, principally trade structured finance and financial risk management services, to customers and other third parties. Our trade structured finance operations primarily leverage our international trade flows to generate trade finance derived liquidity in emerging markets for third parties. Our financial risk management services include structuring and marketing risk management products to enable agricultural producers and end users of commodities to manage commodity price risk exposures. We also engage in foreign exchange and other financial instrument trading via our financial services business. Additionally, we provide financing services to farmers, primarily in Brazil, from whom we purchase soybeans and other agricultural commodities. Our farmer financing activities are an integral part of our grain and oilseed origination activities as they help assure the annual supply of raw materials for our Brazilian agribusiness operations.
Biodiesel—We own and operate conventional biodiesel facilities in Europe and Brazil and have equity method investments in conventional biodiesel producers in Europe and Argentina. This business is complementary to our core Agribusiness operations as in each case we supply some of the raw materials (refined or partially refined vegetable oil) used in their production processes. 
Raw Materials—We purchase oilseeds and grains either directly from farmers or indirectly through intermediaries. Although the availability and price of agricultural commodities may, in any given year, be affected by unpredictable factors such as weather, government programs and policies, and farmer planting and selling decisions, our operations in major crop growing regions have enabled us to source adequate raw materials for our operational needs.
Competition—Due to their commodity nature, markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to product substitution. Competition is principally based on price, quality, product and service offerings, and geographic location. Major competitors include but are not limited to: The Archer Daniels Midland Co. ("ADM"), Cargill Incorporated ("Cargill"), Louis Dreyfus Group ("Louis Dreyfus"), Glencore International PLC ("Glencore"), Wilmar International Limited ("Wilmar") and COFCO International ("COFCO").
Refined and Specialty Oils Segment
Overview—We primarily sell our refined and specialty oil products to food processors, food service companies, and retail outlets, as well as for feedstock to renewable diesel companies. The principal raw materials used in our Refined and Specialty Oils segment are various crude and further processed vegetable oils and fats. These raw materials are mostly agricultural commodities that we either produce or purchase from third parties. We believe that our global integrated business model enables us to realize synergies among our Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils and Milling segments through raw material procurement, logistics, risk management and the co-location of industrial facilities, enabling us to supply customers with reliable, high quality products on a global basis. As many of the products we sell in our Refined and Specialty Oils segment are staple foods or ingredients, these businesses generally benefit from global population and income growth rates.
Products—Our refined and specialty oil products include packaged and bulk oils and fats, including cooking oils, shortenings, margarines, mayonnaise and other products derived from the vegetable oil refining process. We primarily use soybean, sunflower, rapeseed and canola oil that we produce in our Agribusiness segment processing operations as raw materials in this business. We also refine and fractionate palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, and shea butter, and blend and refine olive oil. Additionally, we produce specialty ingredients derived from vegetable oils, such as lecithin, which is used as an emulsifier in a broad range of food products. We are a leading seller of packaged vegetable oils worldwide, based on sales. We have refined and specialty oils refining and packaging facilities in North America, South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Africa. Our refined and specialty oils business comprises our wholly-owned refined oils business in North America, other business to business ("B2B") and business to consumer ("B2C") specialty oils offerings in South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, as well as Bunge Loders Croklaan ("Loders"), which itself is represented by our 70% ownership interest in the Bunge Loders Croklaan joint venture with IOI.
In Brazil, our retail edible oil brands include Soya, the leading consumer packaged vegetable oil brand, as well as Primor and Salada. Further, we are a leading supplier of shortenings to the food processor market and also produce staple food products. 
In the United States and Canada, we offer food manufacturers, bakeries, confectionary, and food service operators high-quality solutions to fit their goals, such as delivering desired tastes and textures, or reducing trans-fats or saturated fats in their products. Our products include trans-fat free high-oleic canola oil, which is low in saturated fats, and high-oleic soybean oil, which is highly stable and trans-fat free. We have also developed proprietary fiber addition processes that allow bakery and food processor customers to achieve significant saturated fat reductions in shortenings. We also offer expeller-pressed and physically-refined oils to food service customers under the Whole Harvest brand, and produce margarines and buttery spreads, including our leading Country Premium brand, for food service, food processor and retail private label customers. Additionally, we sell refined vegetable oils as feedstock to the growing renewable diesel sector.
In Europe, we are a leader in consumer packaged vegetable oils, which are sold in various geographies under brand names including Venusz, Floriol, Kujawski, Unisol, Kaliakra, Ideal, Oleina, Oliwier, Komili and Kirlangic. We are also a leader in margarines, under brand names including Smakowita, Slynne, Maslo Rosline, Masmix, Optima, Finuu, Deli Reform, Keiju, Venusz, Evesol, Carlshamn and Voimix. Additionally, we produce a variety of products for the confectionary and bakery industries. We are also an oils supplier through Loders in the Western European food service channel.
In Asia, we offer a range of consumer products and offerings through Loders, including bakery, culinary, confectionary and infant nutrition products. In India, our consumer brands include Dalda, Ginni and Chambal edible oils; Dalda and Gagan vanaspatis; and Masterline professional bakery fats. In China, we offer consumer edible oils products under the Dou Wei Jia brand. 
Customers—Our customers include baked goods companies, snack food producers, confectioners, restaurant chains, food service operators, infant nutrition companies, other food manufacturers who use vegetable oils and shortenings as ingredients in their operations, and renewable diesels producers that use refined vegetable oils as feedstock. Other customers include grocery chains, wholesalers, distributors, and other retailers who sell to consumers either under our own brand names or private labels. These customers include global and national food processors and manufacturers, many of which are leading brand owners in their product categories.
Competition—Competition is based on a number of factors, including price, raw material procurement, distribution capability, cost structure, brand recognition, product quality, product innovation, technical support, composition and nutritional value, and advertising and promotion. Our products may compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private label and customized products. Our principal competitors in the Refined and Specialty Oils segment include, but are not limited to: ADM, AAK AB, Cargill, Fuji Oil Co. Ltd. and Wilmar, as well as local competitors in each region.
Milling Segment
Overview—We primarily sell our milling products to three customer types or market channels: food processors, food service companies and retail outlets. The principal raw materials used in our milling businesses are wheat, corn, and other agricultural commodities sourced from our Agribusiness segment or directly from third parties. Similar to our refined and specialty oils business, we realize synergies among our other segments in areas such as raw material procurement, logistics, risk management and the co-location of industrial facilities, enabling us to supply customers with reliable, high quality products on a global basis. As many of the products we sell in our Milling segment are staple foods or ingredients, these businesses generally benefit from macro population and income growth rates. Additionally, our Milling segment is focused on capitalizing on growing global consumer food trends, including a desire for less processed, healthier foods, interest in new flavors, and increases in snacking and eating outside the home. 
Products—Our Milling segment activities include the production and sale of a variety of wheat flours and bakery mixes in Brazil and Mexico, as well as corn-based products derived from both the dry and wet corn milling processes in the United States and Mexico. During 2021, we announced the sale of our wheat milling business in Mexico, which is expected to close during the second quarter of 2022.
Our brands in Brazil include Suprema, Soberana, Primor and Predileta wheat flours, Gradina and Pre-Mescla bakery premixes and Ricca confectioner cream. Our wheat flour and bakery mix brands in Mexico include Espiga, Espiga Mix, Villa Rica, Cuauhtemoc, San Vicente, Manitoba and Escudo Plus. Our corn milling products primarily consist of dry-milled corn meals and flours, wet-milled masa and flours, flaking and brewers' grits, as well as soy-fortified corn meal, corn-soy blends, and other similar products. As part of our corn portfolio, we also sell whole grain and fiber ingredients. In the United States, we offer ancient grains, such as quinoa and millet, in our portfolio. We also produce a range of extruded products including die-cut pellets for the snack food industry. Additionally, we offer non-GMO products in the United States, including corn varieties. 
Customers—The primary customers for our wheat milling products are food processing, bakery and food service companies. The primary customers for our corn milling products are companies in the food-processing sector, such as cereal, snack, bakery and brewing companies, as well as the U.S. Government under its humanitarian assistance programs. 
Competition—Competition is based on a variety of factors, including price, raw material procurement, brand recognition, product quality, nutritional profile, dietary trends and distribution capabilities. In Brazil, our major competitors are M. Dias Branco, J. Macedo and Moinho Anaconda, as well as many small regional producers. Our major competitors in Mexico include Elizondo Agroalimentos, S.A. de C.V., Harinera Anáhuac, S.A. de C.V., Molinera de México S.A. de C.V., and Grupo Trimex S.A. Our major competitors in North American corn milling include Cargill, Didion Inc., SEMO Milling, LLC, Life Line Foods, LLC and Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. 
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to our individual reporting segments because the operating performance of such segments is evaluated by our chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including Bunge Ventures, the Company's captive insurance program, accounts receivable securitization activities, and certain income tax assets and liabilities.
Non-core Segment
Sugar and Bioenergy Segment
Our Sugar and Bioenergy segment primarily comprises our 50% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia, our joint venture with BP formed in December 2019 by the combination of our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations with the Brazilian biofuels business of BP. BP Bunge Bioenergia operates on a stand-alone basis with a total of 11 mills located across the Southeast, North and Midwest regions of Brazil. BP Bunge Bioenergia is now the second largest operator by effective crushing capacity in the Brazilian sugarcane ethanol biofuel industry. Our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations had previously formed the majority of our Sugar and Bioenergy segment through which we produced and sold sugar and ethanol derived from sugarcane, as well as energy derived from the sugar and ethanol production process. As a result of forming this joint venture, we ceased to consolidate our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations in our consolidated financial statements and now account for our interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our reported Sugar and Bioenergy results for 2021 and 2020 include our share of the net earnings in BP Bunge Bioenergia, whereas our Sugar and Bioenergy results for 2019 reflect our former 100% ownership interest in the Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations contributed to BP Bunge Bioenergia. Although we are committed to supporting the growth and development of BP Bunge Bioenergia, our long-term goal is to seek strategic opportunities for our investment in the joint venture, hence the designation of such operations as Non-core.
The formation of BP Bunge Bioenergia combined our eight mills, the plantations we owned and managed, and related assets, together with BP’s sugar and bioenergy business in Brazil, which included three mills and related assets. BP Bunge Bioenergia's combined mills are supplied with sugarcane grown on approximately 450,000 hectares of land. In 2021, approximately 75% of the joint venture's total milled sugarcane came from plantations owned or managed by BP Bunge Bioenergia and 25% was purchased from third-party suppliers. These mills allow BP Bunge Bioenergia to produce sugar, ethanol and electricity, as further described below.
•Sugar-BP Bunge Bioenergia produces two types of sugar: very high polarity ("VHP") raw sugar and crystal sugar. VHP sugar is similar to the raw sugar traded on major commodities exchanges, including the standard NY11 contract, and is sold almost exclusively for export. Crystal sugar is a non-refined white sugar and is principally sold domestically in Brazil.
•Ethanol-BP Bunge Bioenergia produces and sells two types of ethanol: hydrous and anhydrous. Hydrous ethanol is consumed directly as a transport fuel, while anhydrous ethanol is blended with gasoline in transport fuels.
•Electricity-BP Bunge Bioenergia generates electricity from burning sugarcane bagasse in its mills.
The sugar produced at BP Bunge Bioenergia’s mills is sold in both the Brazilian domestic market, primarily in the confectionary and food processing industries, and export markets. The ethanol is sold primarily to customers for use in the Brazilian domestic market to meet demand for fuel, with sugar and ethanol also exported in the international market. BP Bunge Bioenergia competes with other sugar and ethanol producers both in Brazil and internationally, along with beet sugar processors and producers of other sweeteners and biofuels in the global market. Major competitors in Brazil include Cosan Limited/Raizen, São Martinho S.A. and Biosev ("Louis Dreyfus"). Major international competitors include British Sugar PLC, Südzucker AG, Cargill, Tereos S.A., Sucden S.A., ED&F Man Limited and COFCO.
Risk Management
Risk management is a fundamental aspect of our business. Engaging in the hedging of risk exposures and anticipating market developments are critical to protecting and enhancing our return on assets. As such, we are active in physical and derivative markets for agricultural commodities, energy, ocean freight, foreign currency, and interest rates. We seek to leverage the market insights that we gain through our global operations across our businesses by actively managing our physical and financial positions on a daily basis. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."
Insurance
In each country in which we conduct business, our operations and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. We insure our businesses and assets in each country in a manner that we deem appropriate for a company of our size and activities, based on an analysis of the relative risks and costs. We believe that our geographic dispersion of assets helps mitigate the risk to our business from an adverse event affecting a specific facility. However, if we were to incur a significant loss or liability for which we were not insured in full or in part, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Operating Segments and Geographic Areas
We have included financial information about our reportable segments and our operations by geographic area in Note 28- Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Research and Development, Innovation, Patents and Licenses
Our research and development activities are focused on developing products and improving processes that will drive growth or otherwise add value to our core business operations. In our Refined and Specialty Oils and Milling businesses, we have 15 research and development centers globally to support product development and enhancement. Additionally, Bunge Ventures, our corporate venture capital unit, invests in start-ups and other early stage companies that are developing new technologies relevant to our industries.
We own trademarks, patents and licenses covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes. However, neither our business as a whole nor any segment is dependent on any specific trademark, patent or license. 
Seasonality
In our Agribusiness segment, while there is a degree of seasonality in the growing season and procurement of our principal raw materials, such as oilseeds and grains, we typically do not experience material fluctuations in volume between the first and second half of the year, since we are geographically diversified between the northern and southern hemispheres and we sell and distribute products throughout the year. However, the first quarter of the year has generally been our weakest in terms of financial results due to the timing of the North and South American oilseed harvests, as the North American harvest peaks in the third and fourth quarters, and the South American harvest peaks in the second quarter. Our North and South American grain merchandising and oilseed processing activities are, therefore, generally at lower levels during the first quarter.
In our Refined and Specialty Oils and Milling segments, demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays and other annual events.
Government Regulation
In each of the countries in which we operate, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing various aspects of our business, including general business regulations as well as those governing the manufacturing, production, handling, storage, transport, marketing and sale of our products. These include laws and regulations relating to facility licensing and permitting, food and feed safety, the handling and production of regulated substances, nutritional and labeling requirements, global trade compliance and other matters. Our operations and those of our suppliers are also subject to restrictions on land use in certain protected areas, forestry reserve requirements, limitations on water use, as well as other environmental regulations. Additionally, from time-to-time, agricultural production shortfalls in certain regions, and growing demand for agricultural commodities for feed, food and fuel use have caused prices for relevant agricultural commodities to rise. High commodity prices and regional crop shortfalls have led, and in the future may lead, governments to impose price controls, tariffs, export restrictions and other measures designed to ensure adequate domestic supplies and/or mitigate price increases in their domestic markets, as well as increase the scrutiny of competitive conditions in their markets.
Many countries use and produce biofuels as alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. Biofuels convert crops, such as sugarcane, corn, soybeans, palm, rapeseed, canola, and other oilseeds, into ethanol, renewable diesel, or biodiesel to extend, enhance or substitute for fossil fuels. Production of biofuels has increased significantly in the last decade in response to both periods of high fossil fuel prices and to government incentives to produce biofuels offered in many countries, including the United States, Brazil, Argentina and several South-East Asian and European countries. Furthermore, in several countries, governmental authorities are mandating biofuel use in transport fuels at specified levels. As such, the markets for agricultural commodities used in the production of biofuels have become increasingly affected by the growth of the biofuels industry and related legislation.
We are subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, and we incur costs to comply with these requirements. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental matters has not had a material financial or competitive effect on our business. However, due to our extensive operations across multiple industries and jurisdictions globally, we are exposed to the risk of claims and liabilities under these laws and regulations. Violations can result in substantial fines, administrative sanctions, criminal penalties, revocations of operating permits and/or shutdowns of our facilities, litigation, other liabilities, as well as damage to our reputation.
Additionally, our business could be affected in the future by the regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas emissions or policies related to national emission reduction plans. A number of jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including, but not limited to, the Unites States, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and its member states, and China. For example, the Biden Administration has issued a series of executive orders and regulatory initiatives focused on climate change, including rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, pursuant to which the Administration has announced a goal of reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by one-half by 2030. Our operations located in countries with effective and applicable carbon pricing and regulatory programs currently meet related existing obligations with, at this time, no significant impact on our results of operations and competitive position. We regularly assess the potential impacts to our business resulting from regulation or policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and additional investments to modify our facilities, equipment and processes. Although, at this time, it is not possible to estimate the likelihood of passage or predict the potential impact of any additional legislation, regulations or agreements, the effects of additional climate change regulatory initiatives could have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The scope of physical effects of climate change, including shifts in agricultural production areas and climatic volatility, is uncertain, but could in the long-term result in increased adverse incidents of weather-related events that cause disruptions to our operations and may ultimately result in stranded physical assets. We currently believe the breadth and diversification of our global asset network, as well as our participation in the global trade of agricultural commodities, will help to mitigate these risks. 
Sustainability
Bunge believes sustainability is critical to our business. This means we incorporate sustainability and environmental, social and governance ("ESG") factors into many areas of our business, from how we plan and develop our strategic goals, compensate our employees and operate our facilities, to how we engage with our customers, suppliers, employees, communities, shareholders and other stakeholders. We encourage Bunge leadership around the globe to embrace sustainable decision-making across our value chains built on a foundation of ethical leadership, accountability and environmental stewardship.
A key component of Bunge’s sustainability strategy is to be a leader in our industry, urging sustainability and responsibility throughout the supply chain from the farm to the table. Bunge has been a founder and active member of leading industry associations and platforms to find practical solutions to certain sustainability challenges. In order to align with the aspirations of the Paris Climate Agreement, we are committed to mitigating native vegetation conversion associated with agricultural commodity production and trade and we intend to build on our shared efforts, working with governments, farmers, and other key stakeholders in our supply chains, to identify opportunities for public-private collaboration focused on eliminating commodity-driven deforestation. 
To execute our strategy we have a defined sustainability framework that incorporates activities and commitments supporting robust action on climate change, promoting responsible supply chains and ensuring accountability.
Governance
The Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee ("SCRC") of the Board oversees sustainability at Bunge, with certain ESG- related responsibilities integrated across other Board committees. The SCRC meets on a regular basis and is tasked with oversight of governance, policies, strategies and programs related to a comprehensive set of sustainability and corporate social responsibility factors which support the sustainable growth of the Company, including, but not limited to, climate change, environmental matters, human rights, social development, risk management, external trends, external stakeholder engagement, philanthropy, and reporting and disclosure. Additionally, the Enterprise Risk Management Committee ("ERMC") of the Board periodically evaluates climate-related risks and opportunities in connection with its oversight of enterprise risks and risk mitigation strategies. The Audit Committee periodically evaluates applicable trends, risks and developments in non-financial reporting practices and requirements which may impact the Company’s regulatory filings, including ESG-related disclosures. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee ("HRCC") oversees the establishment of sustainability linked-performance goals for our executives and workforce. The sustainability function is executed by the Chief Sustainability Officer who reports to our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO").
Strategy
We are working to position Bunge to address the sustainability challenges facing the food, feed, and fuel supply chains in which we operate. We intend to address those by, among other things, connecting farmers and our end-customers. For example, Bunge is actively engaged in supplying low carbon feedstock for renewable fuels, sourcing and supplying grains planted under regenerative agricultural practices, and supplying certified and verified deforestation-free grains and by-products, among other initiatives.
Our commitment is guided by activities across three core pillars:
•    Action on Climate—We implement innovative solutions designed to minimize our environmental footprint and support projects and activities that strengthen our approach to fighting climate change. 
•    Responsible Supply Chains—We promote sustainable agriculture and implement projects that are designed to protect and improve the environment, while supporting the social and economic well-being of growers and local communities.
•    Accountability—We aim to be an accountable leader within our industry, helping to raise the bar on our sector’s performance by regularly tracking and disclosing progress on our commitments and sustainability performance.
Risk Management
In 2021, Bunge began implementing enhancements to its enterprise risk management (ERM) framework by incorporating more detailed sustainability risks and opportunities into the ERM process. These include risks emanating from changing climate and weather patterns, water scarcity, deforestation, human rights, farmer productivity and increasing taxation and regulation on greenhouse gas emissions. The enhanced ERM framework provides Bunge with greater oversight and management of climate-related risks and the potential financial implications, and will help ensure continued short-, medium- and long-term resilience. 
Climate risks are overseen at the Board of Directors level by the ERMC which has responsibility for supervising the quality and integrity of our risk management practices. Enterprise risk management is overseen at the executive level by the Chief Risk Officer, who reports to our CEO, with input from relevant teams and functions.
Metrics and Targets
Our employees and leaders work to expand the adoption of new technologies and energy sources, and partner with suppliers to find ideal solutions that reduce our environmental footprint. Since 2008 we have pursued targets to reduce water, waste, emissions and energy intensity usage in our facilities.
•Water – The consumption of water from natural sources is monitored periodically by our industrial teams. We monitor and report data on water consumption from regions identified by objective third parties as being under "high stress." We believe that it is important to focus on the areas where water availability is a higher risk, so we have developed a more focused goal to reduce water usage from these areas.
•Energy – We continuously work to improve energy efficiencies by implementing heat reuse methodologies (heat exchangers) in some of our facilities and perform maintenance and replacement of engines with better performance systems to create additional efficiencies across our operations. Additionally, we seek opportunities to reduce the overall emissions from our electricity sources. 
•Waste Disposal – Our operations have policies and procedures in place that determine what we believe to be the correct operation related to waste management. For this purpose, we conduct periodic critical analyses to verify performance.    
•Emissions – We have measurable targets in place for reducing energy consumption and the use of natural resources that directly affect the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere, prioritizing the consumption of renewable energy sources in our industrial units where feasible.
In 2021, we established Science Based Targets for absolute emissions reduction across Scopes 1, 2 and 3, in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. To achieve these targets, Bunge may be required make significant enhancements across our global operations, promote regenerative farming practices, and emphasize decarbonization in shipping and logistics. We expect that a substantial portion of the emissions reduction within our supply chains will be driven by our commitment to achieve deforestation-free supply chains by 2025, which we believe is the earliest in our industry.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we employed more than 22,000 people. Many of our employees are represented by labor unions and their employment is governed by collective bargaining agreements. In general, we consider our employee relations to be good.
Our People
We care about our people. We listen, empower, develop and reward them with the goal of driving high levels of engagement and commitment to Bunge. From hiring the best talent to diversity and inclusion initiatives, career development, total employee rewards, and wellness, Bunge strives to create programs and resources that enhance our workplace environment.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business—Bunge Limited, a Bermuda company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries and variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which it is considered the primary beneficiary, through which its businesses are conducted (collectively "Bunge" or "the Company"), is a leading global agribusiness and food company. Bunge's common shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "BG." Bunge operates in four reportable segments: Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, Milling, and Sugar and Bioenergy. 
Corporate and Other includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to the Company’s individual reporting segments because the operating performance of such reporting segments is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including Bunge Ventures, the Company's captive insurance program, accounts receivable securitization activities, and certain income tax assets and liabilities.
Agribusiness—Bunge's Agribusiness segment is an integrated, global business involved in the purchase, storage, transport, processing, and sale of agricultural commodities and commodity products. Bunge's agribusiness operations and assets are located in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific with merchandising and distribution offices throughout the world.
Bunge's Agribusiness segment also participates in related financial activities, such as offering trade structured finance, which leverages its international trade flows, providing risk management services to customers by assisting them with managing price exposure to agricultural commodities, foreign exchange and other financial instruments.
Refined and Specialty Oils —Bunge's Refined and Specialty Oils segment produces and sells edible oil products, such as packaged and bulk oils and fats, shortenings, margarine, mayonnaise, and other products derived from the vegetable oil refining process, and refines and fractionates palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, and shea butter. Bunge's refined and specialty oils operations are located in North America, South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Africa.
Milling —Bunge's Milling segment primarily comprises wheat and corn milling businesses that purchase wheat and corn directly from farmers and dealers and process them into milled products for food processors, bakeries, brewers, snack food producers, and other customers. Bunge's wheat milling activities are primarily located in Mexico and Brazil. Corn milling activities are primarily located in the United States and Mexico. See Note 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information on Bunge's Mexican wheat milling activities.
Sugar and Bioenergy—In December 2019, Bunge contributed its Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations, forming the majority of its Sugar and Bioenergy segment, through which it produced and sold sugar and ethanol derived from sugarcane, as well as energy derived from the sugar and ethanol production process, into a joint venture with the Brazilian biofuels business of BP p.l.c. ("BP"). The joint venture, BP Bunge Bioenergia, in which Bunge has a 50% interest, operates on a stand-alone basis with a total of 11 mills located across the Southeast, North, and Midwest regions of Brazil. Following the formation of the joint venture Bunge no longer consolidates its Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations in its consolidated financial statements, and accounts for its interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting.
Basis of Presentation—The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The accounting policies used to prepare these financial statements are the same as those used to prepare the consolidated financial statements in prior years, except as described in these notes or for the adoption of new standards as outlined below.
Principles of Consolidation—The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bunge, its subsidiaries and VIEs in which Bunge is considered to be the primary beneficiary and, as a result, include the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of all entities over which Bunge exercises control. Equity investments in which Bunge has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Investments in which Bunge does not exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, or fair value if readily determinable. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. An enterprise is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it has a controlling financial interest, defined as (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the economics of the VIE and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE's operations. Performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment. The VIE and consolidation assessments are revisited upon the occurrence of relevant reconsideration events. For VIEs in which Bunge is 
F-9


BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

considered the primary beneficiary, the entities meet the definition of a business and the entities' assets can be used other than for the settlement of the VIE's obligations. 
Noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries related to Bunge's ownership interests of less than 100% are reported as Noncontrolling interests or Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheets. The noncontrolling ownership interests in Bunge's earnings, net of tax, is reported as Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income.
Reclassifications—Effective July 1, 2021, the Company changed its reporting of certain income tax assets and liabilities to report such assets and liabilities within Corporate and Other rather than within its reportable segments, as further described in Note 28- Segment Information. Corresponding prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
Effective January 1, 2021, the Company changed its segment reporting to align with its new value chain operational structure, as further described in Note 28- Segment Information. Corresponding prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
Effective July 1, 2020, the Company changed its reporting of cash proceeds from and repayments of short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less to separately present such cash proceeds and repayments in its consolidated statement of cash flows. Prior to July 1, 2020, the Company presented cash proceeds from and repayments of short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less on a net basis. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
Use of Estimates—The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires Bunge to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Offsetting—In the normal course of its operations the Company routinely enters into transactions resulting in the recognition of assets and liabilities stemming from unconditional obligations, for example trade receivables and trade payables, or conditional obligations, for example unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts at fair value, with the same counterparty. The Company generally records all such assets and liabilities on a gross basis, even when they are subject to master netting agreements.
However, the Company also engages in various trade structured finance activities to leverage the value of its global trade flows. These activities include programs under which Bunge generally obtains U.S. dollar-denominated letters of credit ("LCs") from financial institutions, each based on an underlying commodity trade flow, and time deposits denominated in either the local currency of the financial institutions' counterparties or in U.S. dollars, as well as foreign exchange forward contracts and other programs in which trade related payables are set-off against receivables, when all related assets and liabilities are subject to legally enforceable set-off agreements and the criteria of ASC 210-20, Offsetting, has been met. Cash inflows are offset by the related cash outflows resulting from placement of the time deposits and repayment of the LCs. All cash flows related to the programs are included in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements—Bunge's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the majority of Bunge's foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. As such, amounts included in the consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and changes in equity are translated using average exchange rates during each period. Assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates and resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. However, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, if a foreign entity's economy is determined to be highly inflationary, then the foreign entity's financial statements are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency.
Foreign Currency Transactions—Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gain or loss is included in Bunge's consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net unless the remeasurement gain or loss relates to an intercompany transaction that is of a long-term investment nature and for which settlement is neither planned nor anticipated in the foreseeable future, in which case the remeasurement gain or loss is reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in Bunge's consolidated balance sheets.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash—Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits and readily marketable securities with original maturity dates of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Restricted cash is included with cash 
F-10


BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the consolidated statement of cash flows. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sums to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

 | December 31,
(US$ in millions) | 2021 | 2020 | 2019
Cash and cash equivalents | $ | 902 | | $ | 352 | $ | 320
Restricted cash included in other current assets | 3 | | 29 | | 2 
Total | $ | 905 | | $ | 381 | $ | 322

Trade Accounts Receivable—Trade accounts receivable is stated at historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. Bunge establishes allowances for uncollectible trade accounts receivable based on lifetime expected credit losses using an aging schedule for each pool of trade accounts receivable. Pools are determined based on risk characteristics such as the type of customer and geography. A default rate is derived using a provision matrix with data based on Bunge's historical receivables information. The default rate is then applied to the pool to determine the allowance for expected credit losses. Given the short term nature of the Company's trade accounts receivable, the default rate is only adjusted if significant changes in the credit profile of the portfolio are identified (e.g., poor crop years, credit issues at the country level, systematic risk), resulting in historic loss rates that are not representative of forecasted losses. Uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount that is less than the outstanding historical balance or when the Company has determined that collection of the balance is unlikely.
Specifically, in establishing appropriate default rates as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company took into consideration expected impacts on its customers and other debtors in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, which did not result in a material impact on the financial statements. 
Bunge records and reports accrued interest receivable within the same line item as the related trade accounts receivable. The allowance for expected credit losses is estimated on the amortized cost basis of the trade accounts receivable, including accrued interest receivable. Bunge recognizes credit loss expense when establishing an allowance for accrued interest receivable.
Secured Advances to Suppliers—Secured advances to suppliers are stated at historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. Secured advances to suppliers are expected to be settled through delivery of non-cash assets and as such, allowances are established when collection is not probable. Bunge establishes an allowance for secured advances to suppliers, generally farmers and resellers of grain, based on historical experience, farming economics and other market conditions, as well as specific customer collection issues. Uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount below the outstanding historical balance or when Bunge has determined that collection is unlikely.
Secured advances to suppliers bear interest at contractual rates that reflect current market interest rates at the time of the transaction. There are no deferred fees or costs associated with these receivables. As a result, there are no imputed interest amounts to be amortized under the interest method. Interest income is calculated based on the terms of the individual agreements and is recognized on an accrual basis.
Bunge follows accounting guidance on the disclosure of the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses, which requires information to be disclosed at disaggregated levels, defined as portfolio segments and classes. Under this guidance, a class of receivables is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if Bunge determines it probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected. Recognition of interest income is suspended once the borrower defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined not to be probable. No additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery, at which time amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized interest income.
Inventories—Readily marketable inventories ("RMI") are agricultural commodity inventories, including soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, and wheat that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets, and international pricing mechanisms. All of Bunge's RMI are recorded at fair value. These agricultural commodity inventories have quoted prices in active markets, may be sold without significant further processing, 
F-11


BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs. Changes in the fair values of RMI are recognized in earnings as a component of Cost of goods sold.
Inventories other than RMI are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value by inventory product class. Cost is determined primarily using the weighted-average cost method.
Fair Value Measurements—Bunge determines fair value based on the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Bunge determines the fair values of its RMI, derivatives, and certain other assets based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are inputs based on market data obtained from sources independent of Bunge that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are inputs that are developed based on the best information available in circumstances that reflect Bunge's own assumptions based on market data and on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair value standard describes three levels within its hierarchy that may be used to measure fair value:

Level | Description | Financial Instrument (Assets / Liabilities) 
Level 1 | Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. | Exchange traded derivative contracts.Marketable securities in active markets. 
Level 2 | Observable inputs, including adjusted Level 1 quotes, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. | Exchange traded derivative contracts (less liquid market).Readily marketable inventories. Over-the-counter (‘‘OTC’’) commodity purchase and sale contracts. OTC derivatives whose value is determined using pricing models with inputs that are generally based on exchange traded prices, adjusted for location specific inputs that are primarily observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.Marketable securities in less active markets.
Level 3 | Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. | Assets and liabilities whose value is determined using proprietary pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques. Assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 

Based on historical experience with Bunge’s suppliers and customers, Bunge’s own credit risk, and knowledge of current market conditions, Bunge does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.
In many cases, a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. Bunge’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of fair value assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.
Bunge’s policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels, including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3, is to measure and record the transfers at the end of the reporting period.
The majority of Bunge's exchange-traded agricultural commodity futures are settled daily, generally through its clearing subsidiary, and therefore such futures are not included in the assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—Bunge enters into derivative instruments to manage its exposure to movements associated with agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and energy costs. Bunge's use of these instruments is generally intended to mitigate exposure to market variables (see Note 16- Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities). Additionally, commodity contracts relating to forward sales of commodities in 
F-12


BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

the Company’s Agribusiness segment, including soybeans, soybean meal and oil, corn, and wheat, are accounted for as derivatives at fair value under ASC 815 (see Revenue Recognition below).
Generally, derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in Other current assets or Other current liabilities in Bunge's consolidated balance sheets. For derivatives designated as hedges, Bunge assesses at the inception of the hedge whether any such derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items and, on an ongoing basis, qualitatively monitors whether that assertion is still met. The changes in fair values of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, along with the gains or losses on the related hedged items are recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income in the same caption as the hedged items. The changes in fair values of derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged cash flows affect earnings or when the hedge is no longer considered to be effective. In addition, Bunge may designate certain derivative instruments and non-derivative instruments as net investment hedges to hedge the exposure associated with its equity investments in foreign operations. When using forward derivative contracts as hedging instruments in a net investment hedge, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets.
Marketable Securities and Other Short-Term Investments—Bunge classifies its marketable debt securities and short-term investments as available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, or held-for-trading. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains (losses) included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Held-to-maturity debt investments represent financial assets in which Bunge has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost. Debt trading securities and all equity securities are recorded at fair value and are bought and held principally for selling them in the near term and therefore held for only a short period of time, with all gains (losses) included in Net income (loss). Bunge monitors its held-to-maturity investments for impairment periodically and recognizes an impairment charge when the decline in fair value of an investment is judged to be other than temporary.
Recoverable Taxes—Recoverable taxes include value-added taxes paid upon the acquisition of raw materials and taxable services and other transactional taxes, which can be recovered in cash or as compensation against income taxes or other taxes owed by Bunge, primarily in Brazil and Europe. These recoverable tax payments are included in Other current assets or Other non-current assets based on their expected realization. In cases where Bunge determines that recovery is doubtful, recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts.
Property, Plant and Equipment, Net—Property, plant and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements that extend either the life, capacity, efficiency, or improve the safety of an asset are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Costs related to legal obligations associated with the future retirement of capitalized assets are capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset. Bunge generally capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred during the application development stage. Interest costs on borrowings during construction/completion periods of major capital projects are also capitalized.
Depreciation is computed based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives for property, plant and equipment are as follows:

 | Years 
Buildings | 10 - 50
Machinery and equipment | 7 - 25 
Furniture, fixtures and other | 3 - 20 

Goodwill—Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired in a business acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment, or between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. Bunge's annual impairment testing is generally performed during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which has been determined to be the Company's operating segments or one level below the operating segments in certain instances (see Note 8- Goodwill).
Other Intangible Assets—Finite-lived intangible assets primarily include trademarks, customer relationships and lists, port facility usage rights, and patents that are amortized on a straight-line basis over their contractual or legal lives, or their estimated useful lives where such lives are not determined by law or contract (see Note 9- Other Intangible Assets).
F-13


BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets—Bunge reviews its property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Bunge bases its evaluation of recoverability on such indicators as the nature, future economic benefits, and geographic locations of the assets, historical or future profitability measures, and other external market conditions. If these indicators result in the expected non-recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, Bunge evaluates potential impairment using undiscounted estimated future cash flows. If such undiscounted future cash flows during the asset's remaining useful life are below its carrying value, a loss is recognized for the shortfall, measured by the present value of the estimated future cash flows or by third-party appraisals. Bunge records impairments related to property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets used in the processing of its products in Cost of goods sold in its consolidated statements of income. Any impairment of marketing or brand assets is recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income (see Note 10- Impairments).
Property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets to be sold or otherwise disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
Investments in Affiliates—Bunge has investments in various unconsolidated joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, minus impairment. Bunge reviews its investments annually or when an event or circumstances indicate that a potential decline in value may be other than temporary. Bunge considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time the fair value of the investment is expected to be below its carrying value, the financial condition, operating performance and near-term prospects of the affiliate, and Bunge's intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the fair value. (see Note 10- Impairments and Note 11- Investments in Affiliates).
Revenue Recognition—The Company’s revenue comprises sales from commodity contracts that are accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815) and sales of other products and services that are accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). Additional information about the Company’s revenues can be found in Note 28- Segment Information.
Revenue from commodity contracts (ASC 815)—Revenue from commodity contracts primarily relates to forward sales of commodities such as soybeans, soybean meal and oil, corn, and wheat accounted for as derivatives at fair value under ASC 815, primarily in the Company’s Agribusiness segment. These forward sales meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815 as they have an underlying (e.g. the price of soybeans), a notional amount (e.g. metric tons), no initial net investment, and can be net settled since the commodity is readily convertible to cash. Bunge generally does not apply the normal purchase and normal sale exception available under ASC 815 to these contracts. Certain of the Company’s sales in its Refined and Specialty Oils and Milling segments also qualify as derivatives, primarily sales of commodities like bulk soybean and canola oil.
Revenue from commodity contracts is recognized in Net sales for the contracted amount when the contracts are settled at a point in time by transferring control of the commodity to the customer, similarly to revenue recognized from contracts with customers under ASC 606. From inception through settlement, these forward sales arrangements are recorded at fair value under ASC 815 with unrealized gains and losses recognized in Cost of goods sold and carried on the consolidated balance sheets as current assets (see Note 6- Other Current Assets) or current liabilities (see Note 13- Other Current Liabilities), respectively. Further information about the fair value of these contracts is presented in Note 15- Fair Value Measurements.   
Revenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606)—Revenue from contracts with customers accounted for under ASC 606 is primarily generated in the Company's Refined and Specialty Oils and Milling segments through the sale of refined edible oil-based products such as packaged vegetable oils, shortenings, margarines, and mayonnaise; milled grain products such as wheat flours, bakery mixes, and corn-based products; and fertilizer products. These sales are accounted for under ASC 606 as these sales arrangements do not meet the criteria to be considered derivatives under ASC 815. These revenues are measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and exclude sales taxes, discounts related to promotional programs, and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue from these contracts at a point in time when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer, generally when legal title and risks and rewards transfer to the customer. Sales terms provide for transfer of title either at the time and point of shipment or at the time and point of delivery and acceptance of the product being sold. In contracts that do not specify the timing of transfer of legal title or transfer of significant risks and rewards of ownership, judgment is required in determining the timing of transfer of control. In such cases, the Company considers standard business practices and the relevant laws and regulations applicable to the transaction to determine when legal title or the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.

The transaction price is generally allocated to performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on observable data of the Company’s sales of such products and services to similar customers and in similar circumstances on a standalone basis. In assessing whether to allocate variable consideration to a specific part of the contract, the Company considers the nature of the variable payment and whether it relates specifically to its efforts to satisfy a specific part of the contract. Variable consideration is generally known upon satisfaction of the performance obligation.
    Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. 
    Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in Cost of goods sold.
    Warranties provided to customers are primarily assurance-type warranties on the fitness of purpose and merchantability of the Company’s goods and services. The Company does not provide service-type warranties to customers.
    Payment is generally due at the time of shipment or delivery, or within a specified time frame after shipment or delivery, which is generally 30-60 days. The Company’s contracts generally provide customers the right to reject any products that do not meet agreed quality specifications. Product returns and refunds are not material.
Additionally, the Company recognizes revenue in the Agribusiness segment from ocean freight and port services over time, as the related services are performed. Performance obligations are typically completed within a fiscal quarter and any unearned revenue or accrued revenues are not material.
Share-Based Compensation—Bunge maintains equity incentive plans for its employees and non-employee directors (see Note 26- Share-based Compensation). Bunge accounts for share-based compensation based on the grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
Income Taxes—Income tax expenses and benefits are recognized based on the tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which Bunge's subsidiaries operate. Under Bermuda law, Bunge is not required to pay taxes in Bermuda on either income or capital gains. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and deferred income taxes arising as a result of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in Bunge's financial statements and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if current evidence does not suggest that the deferred tax asset will be realized. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in Income tax (expense) benefit in the consolidated statements of income (see Note 14- Income Taxes).
Research and Development—Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses were $33 million, $24 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832) - Disclosures by Business Entities About Government Assistance, which requires annual disclosures for transactions with a government authority that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. The guidance may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all transactions within the scope of the amendments that are reflected in financial statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are entered into after the date of initial application. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. The guidance also addresses how convertible instruments are accounted for in the diluted earnings per share calculation and requires enhanced disclosures about the terms of convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. Either a modified retrospective method of transition or a fully retrospective method of transition is permissible for the adoption of this standard. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted no earlier than the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company continues to evaluate, but does not expect this standard to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, with subsequent updates through ASU 2021-01, which collectively provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting, to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance is effective upon issuance and is to be applied prospectively from any date beginning March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In March 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") announced that most LIBOR settings will be discontinued after December 31, 2021, except for certain USD LIBOR settings which will continue through to June 30, 2023. In September 2021, the FCA further announced that it will require the LIBOR benchmark administrator to publish sterling and Japanese yen LIBOR settings under a synthetic methodology based on term risk-free rates for the duration of 2022. These synthetic LIBOR settings will be available only for use in legacy contracts and are not for use in new business.
Bunge has utilized the relief provided by Topic 848 to ensure financial reporting results reflect the intended continuation of such contracts and arrangements during the period of the market-wide transition to alternative reference rates. The expedients allow an eligible modified contract to be accounted for and presented as a continuation of the existing contract.
The Company has identified its LIBOR-based contracts that will be impacted by the cessation of LIBOR. To prepare for this change, the Company is actively working with counterparties to incorporate fallback language in negotiated contracts, in addition to incorporating non-LIBOR reference rate and fallback language, when applicable, in new contracts. The evaluation and modification of contracts is ongoing. As such, the Company continues to evaluate the impacts of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
    Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
On January 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740)- Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which reduces complexity in the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify U.S. GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Bunge's consolidated financial statements.
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which introduced a new accounting model, referred to as the current expected credit losses ("CECL") model, for estimating credit losses on certain financial instruments and which expands the disclosure requirements for estimating such credit losses. Under the new model, an entity is required to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). The guidance also amends the current impairment model for debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The Company adopted the guidance under a modified-retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on Bunge's consolidated financial statements.

BP Bunge Bioenergia Formation
    On December 2, 2019, Bunge and BP completed the formation of BP Bunge Bioenergia, the Brazilian bioenergy joint venture that combined their Brazilian bioenergy and sugarcane ethanol businesses. Pursuant to the business combination agreement, the Company and BP contributed their respective interests in their Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations to the joint venture. The Company received cash proceeds of $775 million in the transaction, comprising $700 million in respect of non-recourse debt of the Company assumed by the joint venture at closing, and an additional $75 million from BP, before customary closing adjustments. The Company used the proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness under its credit facilities.

3. TRADE STRUCTURED FINANCE PROGRAM
The Company engages in various trade structured finance activities to leverage the value of its global trade flows. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, net returns from these activities were $31 million, $25 million and $27 million, respectively, and were included as a reduction of Cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. These activities include programs under which Bunge generally obtains U.S. dollar-denominated letters of credit ("LCs") from financial institutions, each based on an underlying commodity trade flow, time deposits denominated in either the local currency of the financial institutions' counterparties or in U.S. dollars, as well as foreign exchange forward contracts, in which trade related payables are set-off against receivables, all of which are subject to legally enforceable set-off agreements.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, time deposits and LCs of $6,543 million and $4,715 million, respectively, were presented net on the consolidated balance sheets as the criteria of ASC 210-20, Offsetting, had been met. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, time deposits, including those presented on a net basis, carried weighted-average interest rates of 1.08% and 1.87%, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, total net proceeds from issuances of LCs were $6,522 million, $4,654 million and $3,318 million, respectively. These cash inflows are offset by the related cash outflows resulting from placement of the time deposits and repayment of the LCs. All cash flows related to the programs are included in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
As part of the trade structured finance activities, LCs may be sold to financial institutions on a discounted basis. Bunge does not service derecognized LCs. The terms of the sale may require the Company to continue to make periodic interest payments to financial institutions based on changes in interest rates for a period of up to 365 days. Bunge’s payment obligation to financial institutions as part of the trade structured finance activities, including any unrealized gain or loss on changes in interest rates, is included in Other current liabilities and is not significant as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The notional amounts of LCs subject to continuing variable interest payments that have been derecognized from the Company's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are included in Note 16- Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The net gain or loss included in Cost of goods sold resulting from the fair valuation of such variable interest rate obligations is not significant for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

Trade Receivables Securitization Program
Bunge and certain of its subsidiaries participate in a trade receivables securitization program (the "Program") with a financial institution, as administrative agent, and certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the "Purchasers") that provides for funding of up to $925 million against receivables sold into the Program. Bunge may from time to time, with the consent of the administrative agent, request one or more of the committed purchasers to increase the total commitments by an amount not to exceed $75 million, pursuant to a $200 million accordion provision, of which $125 million was exercised by the Company on October 6, 2021, thereby increasing the funding commitment from $800 million to the current $925 million level. 
The Program is designed to enhance Bunge's financial flexibility by providing an additional source of liquidity for its operations. In connection with the Program, certain of Bunge's U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries that originate trade receivables may sell eligible receivables in their entirety on a revolving basis to a consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Bunge Securitization B.V. ("BSBV") formed under the laws of the Netherlands. BSBV in turn sells such purchased trade receivables to the administrative agent (acting on behalf of the Purchasers) pursuant to a receivables transfer agreement. In connection with these sales of accounts receivable, Bunge receives a portion of the proceeds up front and an additional amount upon the collection of the underlying receivables.
Koninklijke Bunge B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Bunge, acts as master servicer, responsible for servicing and collecting the accounts receivable for the Program. On May 17, 2021, Bunge and certain of its subsidiaries renewed and amended the Program. As a result, the Program terminates on May 17, 2031. However, each committed purchaser's commitment to purchase trade receivables under the Program will terminate on May 17, 2024, unless extended for an additional period in accordance with the terms of the receivables transfer agreement. 

 | December 31,
(US$ in millions) | 2021 | | 2020
Receivables sold which were derecognized from Bunge's balance sheet | $ | 1,426 | | $ | 969
Deferred purchase price included in Other current assets | $ | 496 | | $ | 177

Bunge's risk of loss following the sale of the trade receivables is limited to the deferred purchase price (the "DPP"), included in Other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 6- Other Current Assets). The DPP will be repaid in cash as receivables are collected, generally within 30 days. Provisions for delinquencies and credit losses on trade receivables sold under the Program as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $5 million, $5 million, and $5 million, respectively.

Restricted cash | 3 | | | 29 | 
Other | 198 | | | 147 | 
Total | $ | 4,751 | | | $ | 6,268

(1)Prepaid commodity purchase contracts represent advance payments against contracts for future delivery of specified quantities of agricultural commodities.
(2)Bunge provides cash advances to suppliers, primarily Brazilian soybean farmers, to finance a portion of the suppliers' production costs, primarily to secure the origination of soybeans for Bunge's soybean processing facilities in Brazil. Bunge does not bear any of the costs or operational risks associated with growing the related crops. The ability of Bunge's counterparties to repay these amounts is affected by agricultural economic conditions in the relevant geography, which are, in turn, affected by commodity prices, currency exchange rates, crop input costs and crop quality and yields. As a result, the advances are largely collateralized by future crops and physical assets of the suppliers, carry a local market interest rate, and settle when the farmers' crops are harvested and sold. 
The secured advances to farmers are reported net of allowances of $3 million and $2 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Bunge periodically evaluates the collectability of Bunge’s farmer receivables and records allowances if Bunge determines that collection is doubtful. Bunge bases the Company’s determination of the allowance of analyses of the credit quality of individual accounts, also considering the economic and financial condition of the farming industry and other market conditions, as well as the value of any collateral related to amounts owed. Bunge continuously reviews defaulted farmer receivables for impairment on an individual account basis. Bunge considers all accounts in legal collections processes to be defaulted and past due. For such accounts, Bunge determines the allowance for uncollectible amounts based on the fair value of the associated collateral, net of estimated costs to sell. For all renegotiated accounts (current and past due), Bunge considers changes in farm economic condition and other market conditions, Bunge’s historical experience related to renegotiated accounts, and the fair value of collateral in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts. 
Interest earned on secured advances to suppliers of $26 million, $31 million, and $26 million, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, is included in Net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
(3)Deferred purchase price receivable represents additional credit support for the Purchasers in Bunge's trade receivables securitization program (see Note 4- Trade Accounts Receivable and Trade Receivable Securitization Program).
(4) Marketable securities and other short-term investments—Bunge invests in foreign government securities, corporate debt securities, deposits, equity securities, and other securities.

8. GOODWILL
Bunge generally performs its annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter. If events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment analyses, the Company performs an impairment analysis at that date. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or the sale or disposition of a significant asset. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, the Company: (1) validates changes, if any, to its reporting units with goodwill balances; (2) allocates goodwill to its reporting units to which acquired goodwill relates; (3) determines the carrying value, or book value, of its reporting units; (4) estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model and/or using market multiples; (5) compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value; and (6) if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment charge for such amount, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
Critical estimates in the determination of fair value under the income approach include, but are not limited to, assumptions about variables such as commodity prices, crop and related throughput and production volumes, profitability, future capital expenditures, other expenses, and discount rates, all of which are subject to a high degree of judgment.

As a result of impairment, certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The fair values of the assets were determined utilizing discounted future expected cash flows, and in the case of equity method investments, net market value based on broker quotes of similar assets.
 11. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES
Bunge participates in various unconsolidated joint ventures and other investments accounted for using the equity method. The Company records its interest in the net earnings of its equity method investees, along with the amortization of basis differences, within Income (loss) from affiliates, in the consolidated statements of income. Basis differences represent differences between the cost of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investment and are amortized over the lives of the related assets that gave rise to them. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate of all basis differences was a credit of $169 million, including $144 million of amortizable basis difference, and $205 million, including $136 million of amortizable basis difference, respectively, primarily associated with BP Bunge Bioenergia.

Variable Interest Entities
Bunge holds investment interests in various entities, as described above, that are included in Investments in affiliates and Other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Certain of these investments, which are primarily reported in Bunge's Agribusiness segment, have been determined to be variable interest entities for which Bunge has determined it is not the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, these investments are not consolidated by Bunge. Bunge's exposure to loss related to these unconsolidated investments is $487 million and $449 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Bunge's exposure to loss primarily comprises Bunge's investments in affiliates balance, third party guarantees, and long term loans, assuming full loss of the investment balance and full payment of the guarantees regardless of the probability of such losses actually being incurred in accordance with US GAAP disclosure rules. See Note 21- Commitments and Contingencies. 
On January 6, 2021, Bunge entered into a series of agreements to acquire a minority interest and certain intellectual property, licensing, and distribution rights in Australian Plant Proteins, a variable interest entity, for $35 million. The Company's exposure to loss related to this unconsolidated investment is primarily limited to the book value of the investment.
On January 18, 2022, Bunge purchased a 33% interest in Sinagro Produtos Agropecuários S.A. ("Sinagro"), a Brazilian distributor of agricultural inputs and originator of grains, in exchange for BRL 251 million ($45 million). In addition, Bunge has provided certain guarantees of SinAgro’s approximately BRL 800 million ($145 million) indebtedness in proportion to Bunge’s 33% equity holding, representing a maximum guarantee of approximately $48 million. The Company's exposure to loss related to this unconsolidated variable interest entity is limited to the book value of the investment and the guarantee, which total $93 million. The transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of 2022.

These Brazilian funds are held in judicial escrow related to certain legal proceedings pending resolution and bear interest at the Selic rate, which is the benchmark rate of the Brazilian central bank.
Income taxes receivable—Income taxes receivable include overpayments of current income taxes plus accrued interest. These income tax prepayments are expected to be used to settle future income tax obligations. Income taxes receivable in Brazil bear interest at the Selic rate.
Affiliate loans receivable—Affiliate loans receivable are primarily interest-bearing receivables from unconsolidated affiliates with remaining maturities of more than one year.
Long-term receivables from farmers in Brazil, net—Bunge provides financing to farmers in Brazil, primarily through secured advances against farmer commitments to deliver agricultural commodities (primarily soybeans) upon harvest of the then-current year's crop and through credit sales of fertilizer to farmers. Certain such long-term receivables from farmers are originally recorded in Other current assets as prepaid commodity purchase contracts or secured advances to suppliers (see Note 6- Other Current Assets) and reclassified to Other non-current assets when collection issues with farmers arise and amounts become past due with resolution of matters expected to take more than one year.

14. INCOME TAXES
Bunge operates globally and is subject to the tax laws and regulations of numerous tax jurisdictions and authorities as well as tax agreements and treaties among these jurisdictions. Bunge's income tax provision is impacted by, among other factors, changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange rates and Bunge's profitability in each tax jurisdiction.

As of December 31, 2021, Bunge has determined it has unremitted earnings that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested of approximately $1 billion, and accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made. If these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, Bunge would be subject to income taxes in the form of withholding taxes to the recipient for an amount of approximately $50 million.
At December 31, 2021, Bunge's pre-tax loss carryforwards totaled $2,245 million, of which $2,111 million have no expiration, including loss carryforwards of $1,060 million in Brazil. While loss carryforwards in Brazil can be carried forward indefinitely, annual utilization is limited to 30% of taxable income calculated on an entity by entity basis as Brazil tax law does not allow consolidated tax filings. At December 31, 2020, Bunge’s pre-tax loss carryforwards totaled $2,166 million, of which $1,778 million had no expiration, including loss carryforwards of $870 million in Brazil. The increase in pre-tax loss carryforwards from 2020 to 2021 is primarily attributable to the Company’s generation of losses in certain jurisdictions during the year. 
The remaining tax loss carryforwards expire at various periods beginning in 2022 through the year 2039.
Income Tax Valuation Allowances—Bunge records valuation allowances when current evidence does not suggest that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends primarily on Bunge's ability to generate sufficient timely future income of the appropriate character in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Bunge has recorded valuation allowances of $297 million and $316 million, respectively. The net decrease of $19 million is primarily attributable to currency translation adjustments during the year.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits—ASC Topic 740 requires applying a "more likely than not" threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits. Accordingly, Bunge recognizes the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, Bunge had recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $73 million and $50 million in Other non-current liabilities and $8 million and $2 million in Other current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, Bunge recognized $4 million, $2 million and $(11) million of interest and penalty charges in Income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, Bunge had recorded accrued interest and penalties of $14 million and $12 million in Other non-current liabilities and $2 million and $1 million in Other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits follows:

(US$ in millions) | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Balance at January 1, | $ | 320 | | | $ | 311 | | $ | 390
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year | 14 | | | 3 | | | 2

Bunge believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $10 million of its unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2022 as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations or resolution with the tax authorities.
Bunge, through its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the United States (federal and various states) and non-United States regions. The table below reflects the tax years for which Bunge is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities in significant tax regions:

 | Open Tax Years
North America | 2013 - 2021 
South America | 2015 - 2021 
Europe | 2015 - 2021 
Asia-Pacific | 2006 - 2021 

As of December 31, 2021, Bunge's Brazilian subsidiaries have received income tax and penalty assessments through 2016 of approximately 5,475 million Brazilian reais (approximately $981 million) plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount. Bunge has recorded unrecognized tax benefits related to these assessments of 19 million Brazilian reais (approximately $3 million) as of December 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2021, Bunge’s Argentina subsidiary had received income tax and penalty assessments relating to 2006 through 2016 of approximately 4,069 million Argentine pesos (approximately $40 million) plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount. 
Management, in consultation with external legal advisors, believes that it is more likely than not that Bunge will prevail on the proposed assessments (with the exception of unrecognized tax benefits discussed above) in Brazil and Argentina and is vigorously defending its position against these assessments.
Bunge made cash income tax payments, net of refunds received, of $531 million, $140 million and $123 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
In October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operations and Development (the "OECD") released an outline that describes the conceptual agreement between 136 countries on fundamental reforms to international tax rules. The outline provides for two primary "Pillars"; however, only Pillar Two, which provides for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%,

could have a negative impact on Bunge. The OECD outline suggests that these reforms be implemented by 2023, but it is contingent upon the independent actions of participating countries to enact law changes. In December 2021, the OECD released the Pillar Two Model Rules as approved by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS. The Model Rules define the scope and key mechanics for the Pillar Two system of global minimum tax rules, which includes the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and the Under Taxed Payments Rule (UTPR), referred collectively as the "GloBE" rules. According to the timeline release in October with agreement of member jurisdictions of the Inclusive Framework, the Pillar Two rules should be brought into domestic law in 2022 to be effective 2023, with the exception of the UTPR which is to enter into effect in 2024. Further OECD guidance is expected in 2022. If enacted into law, in whole or in part, this proposed change to international tax rules could have a negative impact to Bunge’s effective tax rate.
15. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Bunge's various financial instruments include certain components of working capital such as trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable. Additionally, Bunge uses short- and long-term debt to fund operating requirements. Trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and short-term debt are each stated at their carrying value, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value. See Note 3- Trade Structured Finance Program for trade structured finance program, Note 12- Other Non-Current Assets for long-term receivables from farmers in Brazil, net and other long-term investments, Note 17- Short-term Debt and Credit Facilities for short-term debt, Note 18- Long-term Debt for long-term debt, and Note 19- Employee Benefit Plans for employee benefit plans. Bunge's financial instruments also include derivative instruments and marketable securities, which are stated at fair value.
    For a definition of fair value and the associated fair value levels, refer to Note 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies.

(1)These receivables are hybrid financial instruments for which Bunge has elected the fair value option.
(2)Unrealized gains on derivative contracts are generally included in Other current assets. There were $49 million and $111 million included in Other non-current assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were $2 million and $63 million included in Assets held for sale at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(3)Other primarily includes the fair values of marketable securities and investments in Other current assets and Other non-current assets.
(4)These payables are hybrid financial instruments for which the Company has elected the fair value option. There were zero and $40 million included in Liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(5)Unrealized losses on derivative contracts are generally included in Other current liabilities. There were $49 million and $7 million included in Other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were $1 million and $2 million included in Liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
    Readily marketable inventories—RMI reported at fair value are valued based on commodity futures exchange quotations, broker or dealer quotations, or market transactions in either listed or OTC markets with appropriate adjustments for differences in local markets where the Company's inventories are located. In such cases, the inventory is classified within Level 2. Certain inventories may utilize significant unobservable data related to local market adjustments to determine fair value. In such cases, the inventory is classified as Level 3.
F-36


BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

    If the Company used different methods or factors to determine fair values, amounts reported as unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and RMI at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income could differ. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to the reporting date, amounts reported in future periods as unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and RMI at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income could differ.
    Derivatives—The majority of exchange traded futures and options contracts and exchange cleared contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. The majority of the Company’s exchange-traded agricultural commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, are not included in these tables. The Company's forward commodity purchase and sale contracts are classified as derivatives along with other OTC derivative instruments relating primarily to freight, energy, foreign exchange and interest rates and are classified within Level 2 or Level 3, as described below. The Company estimates fair values based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted as appropriate for differences in local markets. These differences are generally valued using inputs from broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either the listed or OTC markets. In such cases, these derivative contracts are classified within Level 2.
    OTC derivative contracts include swaps, options and structured transactions that are generally fair valued using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not highly active, other observable inputs relevant to the asset or liability, and market inputs corroborated by correlation or other means. These valuation models include inputs such as interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain OTC derivatives trade in less active markets with less availability of pricing information and certain structured transactions can require internally developed model inputs that might not be observable in or corroborated by the market.
 Marketable securities and investments comprise government treasury securities, corporate debt securities and other investments. Bunge analyzes how the prices are derived and determines whether the prices are liquid or less liquid tradable prices. Marketable securities and investments with liquid prices are valued using prices from publicly available sources and classified as level 1. Marketable securities and investments with less-liquid prices are valued using third-party quotes and classified as level 2. 
    Level 3 Measurements
    The following relates to assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 measurements. An instrument may transfer into or out of Level 3 due to inputs becoming either observable or unobservable. See Note 10- Impairments, for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs.
    Level 3 Readily marketable inventories and other—The significant unobservable inputs resulting in Level 3 classification for RMI, physically settled forward purchase and sale contracts, and trade accounts payable relate to certain management estimations regarding costs of transportation and other local market or location-related adjustments, primarily freight related adjustments in the interior of Brazil and the lack of market corroborated information in Canada. In both situations, the Company uses proprietary information such as purchase and sale contracts and contracted prices to value freight, premiums and discounts in its contracts. Movements in the price of these unobservable inputs alone would not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements as these contracts do not typically exceed one future crop cycle.
    Level 3 Derivatives—Level 3 derivative instruments utilize both market observable and unobservable inputs within the fair value measurements. These inputs include commodity prices, price volatility, interest rates, volumes and locations.
The tables below present reconciliations for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. These instruments were valued using pricing models that management believes reflect the assumptions that would be used by a marketplace participant.

16. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
    The Company uses derivative instruments to manage several market risks, such as interest rate, foreign currency rate, and commodity risk. Some of the hedges the Company enters into qualify for hedge accounting ("Hedge Accounting Derivatives") and some, while intended as economic hedges, do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting ("Economic Hedge Derivatives"). As these derivatives impact the financial statements in different ways, they are discussed separately below.
    Hedge Accounting Derivatives - The Company uses derivatives in qualifying hedge accounting relationships to manage certain of its interest rate, foreign currency, and commodity risks. In executing these hedge strategies, the Company primarily relies on the shortcut and critical terms match methods in designing its hedge accounting strategy, which results in 
F-38


BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

little to no net earnings impact for these hedge relationships. The Company monitors these relationships on a quarterly basis and performs a quantitative analysis to validate the assertion that the hedges are highly effective if there are changes to the hedged item or hedging derivative.
    Fair value hedges - These derivatives are used to hedge the effect of interest rate and currency exchange rate changes on certain long-term debt. Under fair value hedge accounting, the derivative is measured at fair value and the carrying value of hedged debt is adjusted for the change in value related to the exposure being hedged, with both adjustments offset to earnings. In other words, the earnings effect of an increase in the fair value of the derivative will be substantially offset by the earnings effect of the increase in the carrying value of the hedged debt. The net impact of fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swaps is recognized in Interest expense. For cross currency swaps, the changes in currency risk on the derivative are recognized in Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net, and the changes in interest rate risk are recognized in Interest expense. Changes in basis risk are held in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized through the coupon.
    Cash flow hedges of currency risk - The Company manages currency risk on certain forecasted purchases, sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses with currency forwards. The change in the value of the forward is classified in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the transaction affects earnings, at which time the change in value of the currency forward is reclassified to Net sales, Cost of goods sold, or Selling, general and administrative expenses. These hedges mature at various times through December 2022. Of the amount currently in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, $3 million of deferred losses is expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next twelve months.
Net investment hedges - The Company hedges the currency risk of certain of its foreign subsidiaries with currency forwards and intercompany loans for which the currency risk is remeasured through Accumulated other comprehensive loss. For currency forwards, the forward method is used. The change in the value of the forward is classified in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the transaction affects earnings by way of either sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign subsidiary.
    The table below provides information about the balance sheet values of hedged items and the notional amount of derivatives used in hedging strategies. The notional amount of the derivative is the number of units of the underlying (for example, the notional principal amount of the debt in an interest rate swap). The notional amount is used to compute interest or other payment streams to be made under the contract and is a measure of the Company’s level of activity. The Company discloses derivative notional amounts on a gross basis.

    Economic Hedge Derivatives - In addition to using derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships, the Company enters into derivatives to economically hedge its exposure to a variety of market risks it incurs in the normal course of operations.
    Interest rate derivatives are used to hedge exposures to the Company's financial instrument portfolios and debt issuances. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is primarily presented in Interest expense.
    Currency derivatives are used to hedge the balance sheet and commercial exposures that arise from the Company's global operations. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold when hedging commercial exposures and Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net when hedging monetary exposures.
    Agricultural commodity derivatives are used primarily to manage the Company's inventory and forward purchase and sales contracts. Contracts to purchase agricultural commodities generally relate to current or future crop years for delivery periods quoted by regulated commodity exchanges. Contracts for the sale of agricultural commodities generally do not extend beyond one future crop cycle. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.
    The Company uses derivative instruments referred to as forward freight agreements ("FFA") and FFA options to hedge portions of its current and anticipated ocean freight costs. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.
    The Company uses energy derivative instruments to manage its exposure to volatility in energy costs. Hedges may be entered into for natural gas, electricity, coal and fuel oil, including bunker fuel. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.
    The Company may also enter into other derivatives, including credit default swaps and equity derivatives to manage exposure to credit risk and broader macroeconomic risks, respectively. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.

17. SHORT-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES
Bunge's short-term borrowings are typically sourced from various banking institutions and the U.S. commercial paper market. Bunge also borrows from time to time in local currencies in various foreign jurisdictions. Interest expense includes facility commitment fees, amortization of deferred financing costs, the impact of designated interest rate hedges, and charges on certain lending transactions. The weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 19.62% and 5.49%, respectively.

(2)Includes secured debt of $41 million and zero at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
Bunge has a $600 million commercial paper program, which is supported by an identical amount of committed back-up bank credit lines (the "Liquidity Facility") provided by banks that are rated at least A-1 by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s Investor Services. The cost of borrowing under the Liquidity Facility would typically be higher than the cost of issuing under Bunge's commercial paper program. At December 31, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and no borrowings outstanding under the Liquidity Facility. At December 31, 2020, there were $549 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and no borrowings outstanding under the Liquidity Facility. The Liquidity Facility is Bunge's only revolving credit facility that requires lenders to maintain minimum credit ratings. On July 16, 2021, Bunge amended and extended the Liquidity Facility to July 16, 2026. 
On July 16, 2021, Bunge entered into an unsecured $1 billion 364-day Revolving Credit Agreement (the "$1 Billion Credit Agreement") with a group of lenders, maturing on July 15, 2022. Bunge may from time to time request one or more of the existing or new lenders to increase the total participations under the $1 Billion Credit Agreement by an aggregate amount up to $250 million pursuant to an accordion provision. Borrowings will bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin, as defined in the $1 Billion Credit Agreement. The $1 Billion Credit Agreement replaced the $1.25 billion 364-day Revolving Credit Agreement that was set to mature on October 21, 2021. Bunge had no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2021 under the $1 Billion Credit Agreement.

On July 16, 2021, Bunge entered into an unsecured committed $1.35 billion 5-year Revolving Credit Agreement (the "$1.35 Billion Credit Agreement") with a group of lenders, maturing July 16, 2026. Bunge may, from time to time, request one or more of the existing or new lenders to increase the total commitments under the $1.35 Billion Credit Agreement by an aggregate amount up to $200 million pursuant to an accordion provision. Borrowings will bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin, as defined in the $1.35 Billion Credit Agreement. The $1.35 Billion Credit Agreement replaced the $1.1 billion five-year syndicated revolving credit agreement that was set to mature on December 14, 2023. Bunge had no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2021 under the $1.35 Billion Credit Agreement.
On October 29, 2021, Bunge entered into an unsecured $865 million Revolving Credit Agreement (the "$865 Million 2026 Facility") with a group of lenders, set to mature on October 29, 2026. Borrowings will bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin, as defined in the $865 Million 2026 Facility. The $865 Million 2026 Facility replaced the $865 million revolving credit facility that was set to mature on September 6, 2022. Bunge had no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2021 under the $865 Million 2026 Facility. 
On December 16, 2021, Bunge entered into an unsecured $1.75 billion revolving credit facility ("$1.75 Billion Revolving Credit Facility") set to mature on December 16, 2024. The interest rate under the $1.75 Billion Revolving Credit Facility is tied to certain sustainability criteria, including, but not limited to, recently established science based targets that define Bunge's climate goals within its operations and a commitment to eliminate deforestation in its supply chains by 2025. Bunge may from time to time, with the consent of the agent, request one or more of the existing lenders or new lenders to increase the total commitments by an amount not to exceed $250 million pursuant to an accordion provision set forth in the $1.75 Billion Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the $1.75 Billion Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin, which will vary from 0.30% to 1.30%, based on the senior long-term unsecured debt ratings provided by Moody’s Investors Services Inc. and S&P Global Ratings. Bunge will also pay a fee that will vary from 0.10% to 0.40% based on its utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility. The $1.75 Billion Revolving Credit Facility replaced the $1.75 billion revolving credit facility that was set to mature on December 12, 2022. There were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2021 under the $1.75 Billion Revolving Credit Facility.
At December 31, 2021, Bunge had $5,815 million unused and available committed borrowing capacity comprising committed revolving credit facilities and the commercial paper program, totaling $5,565 million with a number of financial institutions, in addition to a committed unsecured $250 million delayed draw term loan (see Note 18- Long-term Debt). At December 31, 2020, Bunge had total committed revolving credit facilities of $5,565 million with a number of financial institutions, of which $4,072 million was unused and available.
In addition to the committed facilities discussed above, from time to time, Bunge Limited and/or its financing subsidiaries enter into uncommitted bilateral short-term credit lines as necessary based on its financing requirements. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were zero and $550 million borrowings outstanding, respectively, under these bilateral short-term credit lines. Loans under such credit lines are non-callable by the respective lenders. In addition, Bunge's operating companies had $673 million and $785 million in short-term borrowings outstanding from local bank lines of credit at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, to support working capital requirements.
On February 25, 2021, Bunge entered into an unsecured $250 million 364-day term loan (the "$250 Million Term Loan"), scheduled to mature on February 24, 2022. On October 29, 2021 Bunge prepaid the outstanding balance of the $250 Million Term Loan. 
On February 23, 2021, Bunge entered into an unsecured $125 million 364-day term loan (the "$125 Million Term Loan"), scheduled to mature on February 22, 2022. On July 16, 2021 Bunge prepaid the outstanding balance of the $125 Million Term Loan.
Bunge's credit facilities require it to comply with specified financial covenants related to minimum net worth, minimum current ratio, a maximum debt to capitalization ratio, and limitations on secured indebtedness. Bunge was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021.

On May 14, 2021, Bunge completed the sale and issuance of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.750% unsecured senior notes (the "2.75% Senior Notes") due May 14, 2031. The 2.75% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Bunge. The offering was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-231083) filed by the Company and its 100% owned finance subsidiary Bunge Limited Finance Corp. with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Interest on the 2.75% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in November and May of each year, commencing on November 14, 2021. At any time prior to February 14, 2031 (three months before maturity of the 2.75% Senior Notes), the Company may elect to redeem and repay the 2.75% Senior Notes, at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, at a redemption price substantially equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2.75% Senior Notes being redeemed on the redemption date. The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $990 million after deducting underwriting commissions, the original issue discount and offering fees and expenses payable by Bunge. Bunge used the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of certain short-term debt.
On October 29, 2021, Bunge entered into an unsecured $250 million delayed draw term loan (the "$250 Million Delayed Draw Term Loan") with a group of lenders that is required to be drawn by October 29, 2022. The $250 Million Delayed Draw Term Loan will bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin, as defined in the $250 Million Delayed Draw Term Loan. The $250 Million Delayed Draw Term Loan matures on October 29, 2028 and was not drawn as of December 31, 2021.

Certain of Bunge's term loans require it to comply with specified financial covenants related to minimum net worth, minimum current ratio, a maximum debt to capitalization ratio, and limitations on secured indebtedness. Bunge was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021.
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Bunge paid interest, net of interest capitalized, of $285 million, $264 million, and $327 million, respectively.
On February 23, 2022, Bunge Limited delivered a redemption notice for all of its 4.35% senior notes due 2024 (2024 Notes) pursuant to the terms of indenture governing the 2024 Notes. Following such redemption, which is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2022, the 2024 Notes will be cancelled and will no longer be outstanding. Additionally, the Company will recognize a one-time charge of approximately $40 million to $50 million within Interest expense during the first quarter of 2022 comprising the sum of the “make whole” provision payable in respect of the early redemption and the recognition of unrealized mark-to-market losses on related, designated interest rate hedges.
19. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Certain of Bunge's United States, Canadian, European, Asian and Brazilian-based subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees of such subsidiaries. The plans provide benefits primarily based on participant salaries and lengths of service. The funding policies for Bunge's defined benefit pension plans are determined in accordance with statutory funding requirements. The most significant defined benefit plan is in the United States. 
Certain of Bunge's United States and Brazilian-based subsidiaries have benefit plans to provide postretirement healthcare benefits to eligible retired employees of those subsidiaries. The plans require minimum retiree contributions and define the maximum amount the subsidiaries will be obligated to pay under the plans. Bunge's policy is to fund these costs as they become payable.
 Plan amendments and pension liability adjustments - On September 19, 2017, Bunge approved changes to certain U.S. defined benefit pension plans. These changes freeze the plans for future benefit accruals effective January 1, 2023, and these plans are closed for participation for employees hired on or after January 1, 2018. 
Plan Settlements - Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company, together with plan participants and related employee unions, agreed to the transition of one of the Company’s international defined-benefit pension plans to a multi-employer pension plan. Following the transition the Company will account for the multi-employer plan similar to a defined contribution plan, giving rise to a settlement of the related defined-benefit plan obligations. In connection with the settlement, during the first quarter of 2022 the Company expects to record a $3 million decrease in recorded benefit obligations and to reclassify a pretax unamortized gain of approximately $38 million, including amounts attributable to non-controlling interests, from Other comprehensive income to Other income - net in the consolidated statement of income.

On July 17, 2020, the Company approved a one-time lump sum offering to certain participants in Bunge's defined benefit U.S. Pension Plan who had separated from the Company as of December 31, 2019 and whose benefits in the plan had fully vested. The respective payments were completed during the fourth quarter of 2020. The payments, which were paid from plan assets as settlement of respective benefit obligations, resulted in an $88 million decrease in benefit obligations and the reclassification of an unamortized loss of $12 million from Other comprehensive income, which was recorded in Other income - net on the consolidated statement of income. 
In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred a small settlement in respect of one of its international plans, resulting in the reclassification of an unamortized loss of $4 million from Other comprehensive income, which was also recorded in Other income - net on the consolidated statement of income.
On July 24, 2020, the Company made a one-time cash contribution payment to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Plan Transfers In and Out - There were no significant transfers into or out of Bunge's employee benefit plans during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020.
Cost of Benefit Plans - Service cost is recognized in a period determined as the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to services rendered by employees during that period. Interest cost is the amount recognized in a period determined as the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets. Amortization of net loss represents the recognition in net periodic cost over several periods of amounts previously recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss). Service cost is included in the same income statement line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, while the other components of net periodic benefit pension cost are presented separately in Other income, net.
The components of net periodic benefit costs for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

 | Pension BenefitsDecember 31, | | Postretirement BenefitsDecember 31,

Assumptions used in Postretirement Benefits Calculations - At December 31, 2021, a 7.2% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2021 postretirement benefit plan measurement purposes, decreasing to 6.6% by 2038, and remaining at that level thereafter. At December 31, 2020, a 6.8% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2020 postretirement benefit plan measurement purposes, decreasing to 6.6% by 2038, and remaining at that level thereafter.

Increase in future compensation levels | 3.2 | % | | 3.2 | % | 3.2 | % | | N/A | | N/A | | N/A

The sponsoring subsidiaries select the expected long-term rate of return on assets in consultation with their investment advisors and actuaries. These rates are intended to reflect the average rates of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide required plan benefits. The plans are assumed to continue in effect as long as assets are expected to be invested.
In estimating the expected long-term rate of return on assets, appropriate consideration is given to historical performance for the major asset classes held, or anticipated to be held, by the applicable plan trusts and to current forecasts of future rates of return for those asset classes. Cash flows and expenses are taken into consideration to the extent that the expected returns would be affected by them. As assets are generally held in qualified trusts, anticipated returns are not reduced for taxes.
For certain of Bunge’s plans, the discount rate is determined by 1) the yield on a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flow effectively settles the year-by-year projected benefit cash flows or 2) matching either the duration or the expected cash flows for the pension plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed on a region-specific basis using a portfolio of available high quality, non-callable, make-whole corporate bonds.

Pension Benefit Plan Assets—The objective of the plans' trust funds is to sufficiently diversify plan assets to maintain a reasonable level of risk without imprudently sacrificing returns. 
For pension plans in the United States (the "US plans"), in 2020, Bunge hired an outside investment advisory firm to implement a liability-driven investment strategy intended to increase the interest rate and credit risk hedge ratios and increase the duration of pension plan assets to better match the pension benefit obligations. This strategy is intended to reduce the funded status volatility of the US plans. For the largest US plan, derivatives are used primarily to manage risk and hedge plan liabilities while maintaining liquidity. As part of this strategy, the plan is required to hold cash collateral associated with certain derivatives. Target asset allocations are based on a glide path approach, which allocates more plan assets to immunizing assets, such as intermediate and long duration fixed income instruments and treasury strips, which are intended to match the duration and amount of the expected liabilities, and less to growth assets, such as public equities, non-core fixed income instruments and real assets, as the funded status of the plans improve. Target asset allocations are generally 70-80% to immunizing assets and 20-30% to growth assets. For pension plans outside of the United States, the plans’ trust funds utilize a target asset allocation of approximately 60% fixed income securities and approximately 40% equities. 
Bunge implements its investment strategy through a combination of passive and actively managed mutual funds, collective trust funds, and collective investment trusts. The Company's policy is not to invest plan assets in Bunge Limited shares. Plan investments are stated at fair value or net asset value (NAV). For a further definition of fair value and the associated fair value levels, refer to Note 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies.

Employee Defined Contribution Plans—Bunge also makes contributions to qualified defined contribution plans for eligible employees. Contributions to these plans amounted to $17 million, $16 million, and $16 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
20. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
    Bunge purchases agricultural commodity products from certain of its unconsolidated investees and other related parties. Such related party purchases comprised approximately 6% or less of total Cost of goods sold for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Bunge also sells agricultural commodity products to certain of its unconsolidated investees and other related parties. Such related party sales comprised approximately 2% or less of total Net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. 
    In addition, Bunge receives services from and provides services to its unconsolidated investees, including tolling, port handling, administrative support, and other services. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, such services were not material to the Company's consolidated results. 
    At December 31, 2021 and 2020, receivables related to the above related party transactions comprised approximately 2% or less of total Trade accounts receivable. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, payables related to the above related party transactions comprised approximately 5% or less of total Trade accounts payable.
    Bunge believes all transaction values to be similar to those that would be conducted with third parties.
21. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Bunge is party to claims and lawsuits, primarily non-income tax and labor claims in South America, arising in the normal course of business. Bunge is also involved from time to time in various contract, antitrust, environmental litigation and remediation, and other litigation, claims, government investigations and legal proceedings. The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates, and inherent uncertainties. Bunge records liabilities related to legal matters when the exposure item becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Bunge management does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on Bunge’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the remote possibility that a liability arising from these matters could have a material adverse impact in the period the uncertainties are resolved should the liability substantially exceed the amount of provisions included in the consolidated balance sheets. Included in Other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are the following amounts related to these matters:

Brazil indirect taxes - non-income tax claims - These tax claims relate to claims against Bunge’s Brazilian subsidiaries, primarily value-added tax claims (ICMS, ISS, IPI and PIS/COFINS). In August 2017, a law was published, authorizing the states to grant amnesty for tax debts arising from existing tax benefits granted without previous authorization and to maintain such existing benefits still in force for up to 15 years. In December 2017, a further law was published to regulate the existing law referenced above, which endorsed the past incentives granted by the Brazilian states. The states have validated their incentives in accordance with this legislation. As Bunge has not received any tax assessment from the states that granted these incentives or benefits related to their validity, no liability has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. 
On October 8, 2020, the Company was notified that the Brazilian Federal Court of Appeal ruled in favor of the Company in a case against Brazilian tax authorities regarding the right to exclude the value of ICMS from the PIS/COFINS tax basis. The ruling allowed the Company the right to recover amounts unduly paid from August 2009 through December 2020. As a result of the favorable decision, Bunge recorded pre-tax recoveries of R$260 million (approximately $49 million) primarily in 2020 for the recovery of taxes, recognized in Net sales, consistent with how the expense was originally incurred, in the consolidated statements of income. Realization of these benefits occurred through income tax credits applied to the Company's 2021 Brazil federal tax liability. 
As of December 31, 2021, the Brazilian federal and state authorities have concluded examinations of the ICMS and PIS/COFINS tax returns and have issued outstanding claims. The Company continues to evaluate the merits of each of these claims and will recognize them if and when loss is considered probable. The outstanding claims comprise the following:

 | | December 31,
(US$ in millions) | Years Examined | 2021 | 2020
ICMS | 1990 to Present | $ | 222 | $ | 191

Argentina Export Tax — Since 2010, the Argentine tax authorities have been conducting a review of income and other taxes paid by exporters and processors of cereals and other agricultural commodities in the country. In that regard, Bunge has been subject to a number of assessments, proceedings and claims related to its activities. During 2011, Bunge’s subsidiary in Argentina paid $112 million of accrued export tax obligations under protest and challenged the claim. During 2020, the Argentine Supreme Court ruled in favor of Bunge in the first case of these interest charges declaring that they shall be declared extinguished. However, this tax claim is divided into a number of individual controversies that are pending at the Supreme Court, the Federal Court of Appeals or the Tax Court.
Labor claims — The labor claims are principally against Bunge’s Brazilian subsidiaries. The labor claims primarily relate to dismissals, severance, health and safety, salary adjustments and supplementary retirement benefits.
Civil and other claims — The civil and other claims relate to various disputes with third parties, including suppliers and customers.
During the first quarter of 2017, Bunge received a notice from the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense ("CADE") initiating an administrative proceeding against its Brazilian subsidiary and two of its employees, certain of its former employees, several other companies in the Brazilian wheat milling industry, and others for alleged anticompetitive activities in the north and northeast of Brazil. This proceeding was put on hold due to a court injunction obtained by one of the defendants in a case related to the application of the statute of limitations. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2018, Bunge received a notification from CADE that it has extended the scope of an existing administrative proceeding relating to alleged anticompetitive practices in the Rio Grande port in Brazil to include certain of Bunge's Brazilian subsidiaries and certain former employees of those subsidiaries. Bunge is defending against these administrative proceedings and, if unsuccessful in its defense, can further litigate the proceedings via the judicial courts. Therefore, Bunge cannot at this time reasonably predict the ultimate outcome in the judicial courts of the cases or sanctions, if any, that may be imposed.

Total | $ | 522

(1)Bunge has issued guarantees to certain financial institutions related to debt of certain of its unconsolidated affiliates. The terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings, which have maturity dates through 2034. There are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable Bunge to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. In addition, certain Bunge subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations of certain of their unconsolidated affiliates and in connection therewith have secured their guarantee obligations through a pledge to the financial institutions of certain of their unconsolidated affiliates' shares plus loans receivable from the unconsolidated affiliates in the event that the guaranteed obligations are enforced.

(2)Bunge has issued guarantees to certain financial institutions which are party to certain operating lease arrangements for railcars, barges and buildings. These guarantees provide for a minimum residual value to be received by the lessor at the conclusion of the lease term. These leases expire at various dates from 2022 through 2028. At December 31, 2021, no obligation has been recorded related to these guarantees. Any obligation recorded would be recognized in Current operating lease obligations or Non-current operating lease obligations.
Bunge Limited has provided a guarantee to the Director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture as Trustee for Bunge North America, Inc.

23. REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS
    In connection with the acquisition of a 70% ownership interest in Loders, the Company has entered into a put/call arrangement with the Loders' minority shareholder and may be required or elect to purchase the additional 30% ownership interest in Loders within a specified time frame. 
    The Company classifies these redeemable equity securities outside of permanent stockholders’ equity as the equity securities are redeemable at the option of the holder. The carrying amount of redeemable noncontrolling interests is the greater of: (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interests’ share of net income or loss, equity capital contributions and distributions or (ii) the redemption value. Any resulting increases in the redemption amount, in excess of the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interests’ share of net income or loss, equity capital contributions and distributions, are affected via a charge against Retained earnings. Additionally, any such charges to Retained earnings will affect Net income (loss) available to Bunge common shareholders as part of Bunge's calculation of earnings per common share.
24. EQUITY
Share Repurchase Program—In May 2015, Bunge established a program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of Bunge's issued and outstanding common shares. Under this program, 1,298,384 common shares were repurchased for $100 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2,546,000 common shares were repurchased for $100 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Total repurchases under the program from its inception in May 2015 through December 31, 2021 were 8,551,824 shares for $500 million, thereby completing the program. 
Effective October 25, 2021, Bunge's Board of Directors approved a new program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of its issued and outstanding common shares. The program has no expiration date, and there have been no repurchases under this program as of December 31, 2021.
Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preference Shares—Bunge has 6,899,683, 4.875% cumulative convertible perpetual preference shares ("convertible preference shares"), par value $0.01 outstanding at December 31, 2021. Each convertible preference share has an initial liquidation preference of $100 per share plus accumulated unpaid dividends up to a maximum of an additional $25 per share. As a result of adjustments made to the initial conversion price because cash dividends paid on Bunge Limited's common shares exceeded certain specified thresholds, each convertible preference share is convertible at any time at the holder's option into approximately 1.2799 common shares based on a conversion price of $78.1322 per convertible preference share, subject in each case to certain specified anti-dilution adjustments (which represents 8,830,904 Bunge Limited common shares at December 31, 2021).
At any time, if the closing market price of Bunge's common shares equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion price of the convertible preference shares for 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days (including the last trading day of such period), Bunge may elect to cause all outstanding convertible preference shares to be automatically converted into the number of common shares that are issuable at the conversion price. The convertible preference shares are not redeemable by Bunge at any time.
The convertible preference shares accrue dividends at an annual rate of 4.875%. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and are payable, quarterly in arrears, on each March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1, when, and if declared by Bunge's Board of Directors. The dividends may be paid in cash, common shares, or a combination thereof. Accumulated unpaid dividends on the convertible preference shares do not bear interest. In each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Bunge recorded $34 million of dividends, paid in cash, on its convertible preference shares.

26. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, Bunge recognized approximately $61 million, $71 million, and $39 million, respectively, of total compensation expense related to its stock option and restricted stock unit equity awards.
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, Bunge granted equity awards under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2016 EIP"), a shareholder approved plan. Under the 2016 EIP, the Compensation Committee of Bunge's Board of Directors may grant equity-based awards to officers, employees, consultants and independent contractors in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (performance-based or time-based) or other equity-based awards. Shares issued under the 2016 EIP may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares, treasury shares, or shares reacquired by the Company in any manner, or a combination thereof.
Stock Option Awards—Options to purchase Bunge Limited common shares are granted with an exercise price equal to the grant date fair market value of Bunge common stock, vest over service periods that generally range from one to three years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Vesting may be accelerated in certain circumstances as provided in the plans or associated award agreements. Grant date fair value is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis for option grants, and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. Bunge elected to cease awarding stock options to its employees beginning January 1, 2021. Any awards previously granted will continue to vest as awarded.
Restricted Stock Units—Restricted stock units ("RSUs") give recipients the right to receive shares of Bunge common stock upon the lapse of related restrictions determined by the Compensation Committee. The Company has two types of RSUs: time-based restricted stock units ("TBRSUs") and performance-based restricted stock units ("PBRSUs"). Restrictions on TBRSUs are based on continued service by the recipient through the designated term. Restrictions on PBRSUs are based on the achievement of certain performance targets, including earnings per share, return on invested capital, and relative total shareholder return, with the number of PBRSUs earned varying based on the level of achievement against these performance targets. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for restricted stock units. RSUs generally vest over periods ranging from one to three years. Vesting may be accelerated under certain circumstances as defined in the plans or associated award agreements. RSUs are generally settled in shares of Bunge common stock upon satisfaction of the applicable vesting terms, and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. In locations where share settlement may be prohibited under local law, RSUs are settled in cash. At the time of settlement, a participant holding a vested restricted stock unit will also be entitled to receive corresponding accrued dividend equivalent share payments.
Bunge also established the Bunge Limited 2017 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan (the "2017 NED Plan"), a shareholder approved plan. Under the 2017 NED Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant equity-based awards to non-employee directors of Bunge Limited. Awards may consist of restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred restricted stock units and non-statutory stock options.
Restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors generally vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, provided the director continues to serve on the Board until such date, and are settled in shares of Bunge Limited common stock. At the time of settlement, a participant holding a vested restricted stock unit is also entitled to receive corresponding accrued dividend equivalent share payments.
The fair value of each stock option granted under any of Bunge's equity incentive plans is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Assumptions for the three most recent years are noted in the following table. The expected volatility of Bunge's common shares is a weighted average of historical volatility calculated using the daily closing price of Bunge's shares up to the grant date and implied volatilities on open option contracts on Bunge's stock as of the grant date. Bunge uses historical employee exercise behavior for valuation purposes. The expected option term of granted options represents the period of time that the granted options are expected to be outstanding based on historical experience and giving consideration for the contractual terms, vesting periods and expectations of future employee behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a term equal to the expected option term of the respective grants and grant dates.

27. LEASES
    The Company routinely leases storage facilities, transportation equipment, land, and office facilities which are typically classified as operating leases. The accounting for some of the Company's leases may require significant judgment when determining whether a contract is or contains a lease, the lease term, and the likelihood of renewal or termination options. Leases with an initial term of more than 12 months are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets (Operating lease assets) and lease liabilities for the obligation to make payments under such leases (Current operating lease obligations and Non-current operating lease obligations). As of the lease commencement date, the lease liability is initially measured as the present value of lease payments not yet paid. The lease asset is initially measured equal to the lease liability and adjusted for lease payments made at or before lease commencement (e.g., prepaid rent), lease incentives, and any initial direct costs. Over time, the lease liability is reduced for lease payments made and the lease asset is reduced through expense, classified as either Cost of goods sold or Selling, general and administrative expense depending upon the nature of the lease. Lease assets are subject to review for impairment in a manner consistent with Property, plant and equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less ("short-term leases") are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and the related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
    The Company’s leases range in length of term, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 4.0 years, but with one water rights lease for up to 90 years. Renewal options are generally exercisable solely at the Company’s discretion. When a renewal option is reasonably certain to be exercised, such additional terms are considered when calculating the associated operating lease asset and liability. When determining the lease liability at commencement of the lease, the present value of lease payments is based on the Company’s incremental borrowing rate determined using a portfolio approach and the Company’s incremental cost of debt, adjusted to arrive at the rate in the applicable country and for the applicable term of the lease, as the rate implicit in the lease is generally not readily determinable. As of December 31, 2021, such weighted average discount rate was 3.3%. 
    Certain of the Company’s freight supply agreements for ocean freight vessels and rail cars may include rental payments that are variable in nature. Variable payments on time charter agreements for ocean freight vessels under freight supply agreements are dependent on then current market daily hire rates. Variable payments for certain rail cars can be based on volumes, and in some cases, benchmark interest rates. All such variable payments, other than those that depend on an index or rate, are not included in the calculation of the associated operating lease asset or liability subsequent to the inception date of the associated lease and are recorded as expense in the period in which the adjustment to the variable payment obligation is incurred. Certain of the Company’s lease agreements related to railcars and barges contain residual value guarantees (see Note 21- Commitments and Contingencies). None of the Company’s lease agreements contain material restrictive covenants.

    (1) Minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease income receipts of $31 million due in future periods under non-cancelable subleases as of December 31, 2021. Non-cancelable subleases primarily relate to agreements with third parties for the use of portions of certain facilities with remaining sublease terms of approximately four years, as well as an agreement in which the Company subleases storage tanks with remaining sublease terms of approximately four years. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may enter into re-let agreements to sell the right to use ocean freight vessels under time charter agreements when excess capacity is available.
    The Company is expected to have an additional operating lease for ocean freight vessels that has not yet commenced, of $12 million over the life of the lease, as well as a sublease for ocean freight vessels that has not yet commenced with income of $46 million over the life of the sublease. The operating lease is expected to commence in 2022, with a lease term of two years. The sublease is expected to commence early in 2022, with a lease term of three years.

28. SEGMENT INFORMATION
Effective January 1, 2021, the Company changed its reporting segments to align with its new value chain operational structure. Additionally, effective July 1, 2021, the company changed its reporting of certain income tax assets and liabilities to report such assets and liabilities within Corporate and Other rather than within the reportable segments in its new value chain operational structure. 
Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current presentation for these changes in reporting; see Note 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies.
The Company's operations are organized, managed and classified into four reportable segments - Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, Milling, and Sugar and Bioenergy, organized based upon their similar economic characteristics, products and services offered, production processes, types and classes of customer, and distribution methods. The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Corporate and Other.
The Agribusiness segment is characterized by both inputs and outputs being agricultural commodities and thus high volume and low margin. The Refined and Specialty Oils segment involves the processing, production and marketing of products derived from vegetable oils. The Milling segment involves the processing, production and marketing of products derived primarily from wheat and corn. The Sugar & Bioenergy segment primarily comprises the net earnings from the Company’s 50% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia, a joint venture formed in December 2019 through the combination of the Company’s Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations, together with the Brazilian biofuels business of BP p.l.c. ("BP"). Prior to December 2019, the Company’s Sugar and Bioenergy results reflect its 100% ownership interest in the Brazilian sugarcane growing and milling, and sugarcane-based ethanol production activities contributed to the joint venture. 
Corporate and Other includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to the Company’s individual reporting segments because the operating performance of such reporting segments is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including Bunge Ventures, the Company's captive insurance program, accounts receivable securitization activities, and certain income tax assets and liabilities. 
Transfers between the segments are generally valued at market. The segment revenues generated from these transfers are shown in the following table as "Inter-segment revenues."

which $37 million, $1,678 million and $110 million are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses, Cost of goods sold and Other income—net, respectively. Of these pre-tax impairment charges, $1,535 million was allocated to Sugar and Bioenergy, $148 million to Refined and Specialty Oils, $91 million to Agribusiness, $28 million to Milling, and $22 million to Corporate - Other.
Total segment earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT") is an operating performance measure used by Bunge's management to evaluate segment operating activities. Bunge's management believes total segment EBIT is a useful measure of operating profitability, since the measure allows for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. In addition, EBIT is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in Bunge's industries.

30. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On February 21, 2022, Bunge entered into a series of agreements with Chevron Corporation to form a joint venture to, among other things, help meet the demand for renewable fuels and to develop lower carbon intensity feedstocks. Bunge will contribute certain property, plant and equipment related to two of its soybean processing facilities and Chevron Corporation will contribute an approximately equal value of cash and working capital to the newly formed joint venture. The joint venture agreements are subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval. 
As of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Bunge is monitoring the military conflict involving Russia and Ukraine. Bunge maintains operations in both countries, which represent key international grain originating regions. The outcome of the ongoing conflict is uncertain. Bunge's operations in Ukraine have been interrupted and a continuation of the conflict may have a material adverse effect on Bunge's Ukrainian operations. At December 31, 2021, Bunge had total assets and total liabilities of $681 million and $484 million, respectively, in Ukraine. 
Additionally, in response to the conflict, the United States, other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, as well as non-member states, have announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia, certain Russian citizens and enterprises. The continuation of the conflict may trigger a series of additional economic and other sanctions enacted by the United States, other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, and other countries. As Bunge maintains operations in Russia, any such sanctions may also result in an adverse effect on Bunge's Russian operations. At December 31, 2021, Bunge had total assets and total liabilities of $121 million and $36 million, respectively, in Russia.
