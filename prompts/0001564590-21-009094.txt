ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 We are a leading provider of digital marketing software for search, social and eCommerce advertising channels, offered as a unified software-as-a-service, or SaaS, advertising management platform for performance-driven advertisers and agencies. Our platform is an analytics, workflow and optimization solution for marketing professionals, allowing them to effectively manage their digital advertising spend. We market and sell our solutions to advertisers directly and through leading advertising agencies, and our customers collectively manage billions of dollars in advertising spend on our platform globally across a wide range of industries. We believe this makes us one of the largest providers of independent advertising cloud solutions. Our software solution is designed to help our customers:
  
• | measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns through our proprietary reporting and analytics capabilities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | manage and execute campaigns through our intuitive user interface and underlying technology that streamlines and automates key functions, such as advertisement creation and bidding, across multiple publishers and channels; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | optimize campaigns across multiple publishers and channels based on market and business data to achieve desired revenue outcomes using our predictive bid management technology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Advertisers use our platform to create, target and convert precise audiences based on recent buying signals from users’ search, social and eCommerce interactions. Our platform is integrated with leading publishers such as Apple, Amazon, Baidu, Bing, Facebook, Google, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitter, Verizon Media, Yahoo! Japan and Yandex. Additionally, we have integrations with more than 50 leading web analytics and advertisement-serving solutions and key enterprise applications, enabling our customers to more accurately measure the return on investment of their marketing programs.
 Our software platform serves as an integration point for advertising performance, sales and revenue data, allowing advertisers to connect the dots between advertising spend and revenue outcomes. Through an intuitive interface, we enable our customers to simultaneously run large-scale digital advertising campaigns across multiple publishers and channels, making it easy for marketers to create, publish, modify and optimize campaigns.
 Our predictive bid management and optimization technology also allows advertisers to forecast outcomes and optimize campaigns across multiple publishers and channels to achieve their business goals. Our optimization technology can help advertisers increase advertisement spend on those campaigns, publishers and channels that are performing well while reducing investment in those that are not. This category of solutions, which we refer to as cross-channel bid and campaign optimization, helps businesses intelligently and efficiently measure, manage, and optimize their digital advertising spend to achieve desired business results.
 Headquartered in San Francisco, we were incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2006. The mailing address of our headquarters is 123 Mission Street, 27th Floor, San Francisco, California 94105 and our telephone number at that location is (415) 399-2580.

 Our platforms are comprised of the following modules:
  
• | Optimization. Our Optimization module helps advertisers manage bids across publishers to meet revenue goals and identify opportunities for campaign improvements, which we believe can improve financial performance and efficiencies. Forecasting capabilities help predict campaign performance, which simplifies the budgeting process for marketing departments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Campaign Management. Our Campaign Management module provides the digital advertiser with a unified interface to create, manage and optimize campaigns across a broad range of publishers, creating greater efficiencies and increasing flexibility.

 In November 2019, we completed the divestiture of the assets and liabilities related to our Perfect Audience business, which focused on display retargeting advertisements, to SharpSpring, Inc. an unrelated third party for net proceeds of $4.3 million, as further described in Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 Technology & Supporting Platform
 We designed our cloud-based platform to support large global advertisers. The majority of our software is written in Java. Our hardware consists of industry-standard servers and network infrastructure. Our standard operating system is Linux. Our software platform is character-set, language, currency, and time-zone independent. Our technology platform has the following key benefits:

• | Scalability. Our platform is designed to handle billions of advertising units across thousands of advertisers, while delivering a responsive browsing and editing experience. If the number of advertisers and resulting computing and storage requirements changes, we can add or remove hardware to our platform to accommodate the demand.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Availability. Our customers are highly dependent on the availability of our platform, which is designed to be available 24x7, 365 days a year. We operate our own hardware and use third-party data centers that offer server redundancy, back-up communications and power and physical security.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Security. Our platform manages a large quantity of customer data. We employ technologies, policies and procedures to protect customer data. The primary third-party data center that we use to host our platform has SSAE No. 18, Type 2 SOC 1, SOC 2 and SOC 3 attestations and is ISO 27001 certified.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are continuously upgrading our software platform in a manner that we believe will cost-effectively extend the scalability, speed, resiliency and availability of our services and facilitate our ability to add new features to our products.
 Strategic Agreements
 We have entered into long-term strategic agreements with certain leading search publishers. Under these strategic agreements, we receive consideration based on a percentage of the search advertising spend that our customers manage on our platform.
 In December 2018, we entered into such an agreement with Google, under which we receive revenue share payments based on our customers' search advertising spend on Google and certain other eligible search engines. In exchange, we will reinvest a percentage of these revenue share payments to drive our technology platform innovation. This agreement went into effect on October 1, 2018, and is scheduled to terminate on September 30, 2021, although Google may terminate the agreement in certain circumstances. We are in preliminary discussions with Google to extend potentially the term of this agreement, but no assurances can be provided as to whether the term will be extended or as to terms of any extension of the agreement. This agreement and the related revenue recognition considerations are described more fully in Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 Customers
 We market and sell our technology solutions to advertisers directly and through advertising agencies that use our platform on behalf of their customers. Advertisers that we serve through our relationships with agencies generally represented approximately one-
 5

third to one-quarter of our overall revenues. We also generate revenues from leading publishers through our long-term strategic agreements.
 Competition
 The digital advertising cloud market is highly competitive, fragmented, and subject to changes in both technology and customer behavior. We face significant competition today and expect competition to intensify in the future. To maintain and improve our competitive position, we must keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers and continue to develop and introduce new modules, features and services in a timely and efficient manner. We currently compete with large, well-established companies, such as Adobe Systems Incorporated, Facebook, Inc., Google Inc. (through its wholly owned subsidiary DoubleClick) and Kenshoo Ltd. We also compete with in-house proprietary tools, tools from publishers and custom solutions, including spreadsheets. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:

• | solution quality, breadth, stability, flexibility and functionality;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | tangible platform benefits;
--+----------------------------


• | level of customer satisfaction and our ability to respond to customer needs rapidly;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | breadth and quality of advertiser and agency relationships;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to innovate and develop new or improved products and features while maintaining platform speed and stability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to respond to changes in publishers’ application programming interfaces;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | brand awareness and reputation; and
--+------------------------------------


• | size of customer base.
--+-----------------------

 Apart from cross-channel platform competitors, we also compete with channel solutions in the social advertising market. Competitors in the social advertising market include companies such as 4C Insights, Inc., Salesforce.com (through its wholly owned subsidiary Social.com) and Smartly.io Inc.
 Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance in the areas of the quality, functionality and breadth of our solution and the availability and knowledgeability of our customer support.
 Sales and Marketing
 We sell our solutions directly to advertisers and agencies in a wide range of industries through our global sales team. Our sales cycle can vary substantially by advertiser and agency, but can take between three and nine months. We have eight account directors organized by geography and market segments. The same account directors are responsible for long-term customer satisfaction and retention, renewal, support and driving an increase in the volume of media managed by customers on our platform.
 Our marketing team is focused on driving awareness and demand generation across major markets. This team provides thought leadership in the form of white papers, benchmarking reports, bylines, presenting at industry conferences and speaking to the press. In addition, they are responsible for the creation of field enablement assets such as case studies, blog posts and corporate and product collateral.
 Research and Development
 Our research and development team is responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of our platform. Our research and development process emphasizes frequent, iterative and incremental development cycles. Within our research and development organizations, we have several project teams that focus on platform and feature development for our advertising cloud solutions. Each of these project teams includes engineers, quality engineers and product managers, as needed, responsible for the initial and ongoing development for their projects.
Government Regulation
 We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business in the advertising and SaaS industries and on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. The manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the SaaS and advertising industries and the Internet in general and how they will relate to our business in particular, are often unclear. For example, we often cannot be certain how existing laws will apply in the eCommerce and online context, including with respect to such topics as privacy, advertising, pricing, taxation, content regulation, quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement. In addition, in 2020 U.S. federal and 
 6

state and foreign governments and regulatory agencies initiated lawsuits or investigations against Google and Facebook related to certain of their anticompetitive business practices and conduct in the digital advertising and social media industries and we cannot be certain as to how such lawsuits and investigations might affect Google or Facebook or otherwise affect the digital advertising industry.  
 Numerous laws and regulatory schemes have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States, and in some cases internationally, that have a direct impact on our business and operations. For example, on January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act went into effect, providing consumers the right to know what personal data companies collect, how it is used, and the right to access, delete and opt of sale of their personal information to third parties. Additionally, in May 2019, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, governing data privacy replaced the Data Protection Directive and established new requirements applicable to the handling of personal data and imposes penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of €20,000,000 or 4% of worldwide revenue.
 Human Capital Resources
 Our employees are our greatest asset. Our performance depends upon identifying, attracting, developing, motivating and retaining a highly skilled workforce in multiple areas, including engineering, sales and marketing, and customer service. Collectively, our employees have extensive experience and knowledge in digital marketing and we believe that we employ some of the top talent in our industry.   
Workforce Demographics
 As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 162 employees, which was down from a total of 292 employees at December 31, 2018 and a total of 229 employees at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, approximately 45% of our employees were located in the United States, with approximately 40% of our employees located in Europe and approximately 15% of our employees located in Asia. At December 31, 2020, approximately one-half of our employees were on our engineering and research and development teams, with the remainder of our employees comprising our sales and marketing, customer service, and general and administrative teams.  
 During 2020, one of our strategic initiatives was the implementation of a restructuring plan in the third quarter of 2020, which included a global reduction-in-force and other cost saving actions to reduce our operating expenses and address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business (the “2020 Restructuring Plan”). The 2020 Restructuring Plan resulted in the reduction of our global workforce by approximately 60 employees, approximately half of which were located outside of the United States. We also experienced some senior management turnover in 2020, with the departures of the previous managers of our sales team and our customer service teams during the third quarter of 2020. We believe we have successfully restructured these teams and have promoted a talented and experienced new leader for the restructured teams from within our ranks.
Following our recent restructuring efforts, we believe that we have better aligned our human capital resources with the current and planned needs of our business. We are now focused on retaining and motivating our employees at all levels and in all parts of the organization, and we are committed to maintaining a workplace environment that promotes employee productivity and satisfaction.  We do not expect to increase the size of our employee base significantly in the near future.
 Compensation, Benefits and Well-being
 We believe that we offer fair compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being and are competitive in our industry and in the communities in which we operate. To promote alignment with our short- and long-term objectives, our compensation practices for employees include base pay, annual bonuses and other short-term incentives, and equity grants and other opportunities for long-term incentives. We offer an array of benefits, including comprehensive health and wealth insurance. We provide emotional well-being services through an Employee Assistance Program.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes in 2020 that we determined were in the best interests of our company, our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. The vast majority of our employees have been working from home since March 2020 and will likely to continue to do so for at least the next few quarters. In addition, we reduced the salaries of all of our employees whose annual base salary was in excess of $100,000 by up to 10% for the period from June 1, 2020 until August 1, 2020, and we reduced the salaries of our senior executives by 20% from June 1, 2020 until August 1, 2020, which reduction was reduced to 10% from August 1, 2020 until December 31, 2020 and to 0% effective as of January 1, 2021.  We have been very encouraged by how our employees have responded to the challenges that have stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic and have generally maintained their productivity under the evolving working conditions. 
 Communication and Engagement
 We believe that our success depends upon on our employees understanding how their work contributes to our overall strategy and plans. To this end, we try to communicate with our workforce through a variety of channels and encourage open and direct communication, including quarterly company-wide CEO update meetings, regular company-wide call on a variety of topics of interest and frequent email corporate communications.

Diversity and Inclusion
 We strive to promote and advance diversity and inclusion across the country and we value diverse perspectives and life experiences. We believe that everyone deserves respect and equal treatment, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation gender identity cultural background or religious belief. 
Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property rights are a key component of our success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights.
 As of December 31, 2020, we had four issued patents and one patent application pending in the United States. We own and use trademarks on or in connection with our products and services, including two registered trademarks in the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia, China, Japan and Russia; one registered mark in South Korea and Singapore; and unregistered common law marks and pending trademark applications in the United States, Canada and the European Union. We have also registered numerous Internet domain names.
