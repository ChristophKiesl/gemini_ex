Item 1. BUSINESS
General
 Smith Micro develops software to simplify and enhance the mobile experience, providing solutions to leading wireless service providers, device manufacturers, and enterprise businesses around the world.  From optimizing wireless networks to uncovering customer experience insights, and from streamlining Wi-Fi access to ensuring family safety, our solutions enrich connected lifestyles while creating new opportunities to engage consumers via smartphones. Our portfolio also includes a wide range of products for creating, sharing, and monetizing rich content, such as visual messaging, video streaming, and 2D/3D graphics applications. With this as a focus, it is Smith Micro’s mission to help our customers thrive in a connected world.
 Over the past three decades, Smith Micro has developed deep expertise in embedded software for mobile devices, policy-based management platforms, and highly-scalable client and server applications.  Tier 1 mobile network operators, cable providers, OEMs/device manufacturers, and enterprise businesses across a wide range of industries use our software to capitalize on the growth of connected consumers and the Internet of Things (“IoT”).
 In general, we help our customers:
  
• | Optimize networks, reduce operational costs, and deliver “best-connected” user experiences;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Manage mobile devices over-the-air for maximum performance, efficiency, reliability and cost-effectiveness;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide greater insight into the mobile user experience to improve service quality and customer loyalty;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engage and grow high-value relationships with their customers using smartphones.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We continue to innovate and evolve our business to take advantage of industry trends and opportunities in emerging markets, such as “Big Data” analytics, the explosion of Wi-Fi hotspots, and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) mobile marketing and advertising.  The key to our longevity, however, is not simply technology innovation, but a never-ending focus on customer value.
 During fiscal year 2016, we experienced a significant decrease in our revenues primarily due to our largest customer, Sprint, terminating a contract for one of our products.  Even with our two acquisitions and the pipeline of new potential deals, our revenues have been slow to materialize.  As such, we had to implement a significant restructuring plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.  We also impaired one of our acquired intangible assets.
 We have continued to restructure during the first fiscal quarter of 2017 in order to align our expenses with our current short-term revenue projections.  Overall, we have reduced our quarterly expenses by approximately $3.5 million.  
 The Company was incorporated in California in November 1983, and reincorporated in Delaware in June 1995. Our principal executive offices are located at 51 Columbia, Aliso Viejo, California 92656. Our telephone number is (949) 362-5800. Our website address is www.smithmicro.com. Our NASDAQ symbol is SMSI, and we make our SEC filings available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Information contained on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Business Segments
 Our business is focused on two industry segments: Wireless and Graphics. We do not separately allocate operating expenses, nor do we allocate specific assets to these segments. Therefore, segment information reported includes only revenues and cost of revenues. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information related to our business segments and geographical information.

Wireless
 The wireless industry continues to undergo rapid change on all fronts, from the ubiquity of Wi-Fi and cellular networks, to the vast array of connected devices, mobile applications, and digital content consumed by users who want information and entertainment anytime, anywhere.  While most of us think about being “connected” in terms of computers, tablets and smartphones, the IoT is creating a world where almost anything can be connected to the wireless internet.  In addition, pervasive connectivity has changed the way business operates on small and grand scales.  For example, Wi-Fi hotspots are being deployed by neighborhood bookstores and coffee houses to keep customers on premise longer, as well as by large sports arenas to deliver real-time video feeds via social networks and online broadcasts.  Retailers are now spending more than 50% of their advertising budgets on mobile media, and targeting for those advertisements is driven by “Big Data” initiatives that collect consumer information from virtually every online or mobile interaction.
 Although there are numerous business opportunities associated with pervasive connectivity, there are also many challenges:
  
- | Complexity, congestion, and spectrum scarcity plague wireless networks, making it difficult and expensive to satisfy the demand for mobile services by consumers and businesses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Mobile Network Operators (“MNO”) are being marginalized by over-the-top messaging applications and face growing competitive pressure from Cable/Multiple Service Operators (“MSO”) and others deploying Wi-Fi networks to attract mobile users.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Enterprises face increasing pressure to mobilize workforces, operations, and customer engagement, but lack the expertise and technologies needed to leverage mobile securely and cost-effectively.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Consumers – frustrated by slow, congested mobile networks and inconsistent device/app behavior – seek simpler network access and more personalized mobile experiences, while simultaneously demanding faster, cheaper, and more secure wireless services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To address these challenges, Smith Micro offers multi-platform, modular solutions organized into three product families:
 NetWise® – NetWise® is a policy-on-device platform that optimizes wireless Quality of Experience (“QoE”) and enhances mobile customer engagement.

 CommSuite® – CommSuite Visual Voicemail by Smith Micro Software is voicemail, redefined. Gone are the days where consumers can be bothered to manually listen to voicemail on their smartphones. Today’s mobile users want every service on-demand, including voicemail. CommSuite Visual Voicemail quickly and easily allows users to manage voice messages just like email or SMS – with reply, forwarding and social sharing options. Smith Micro’s services feature multi-language Voice-to-Text transcription messaging, which enables discreet message consumption for users by reading versus listening. For operators, CommSuite Visual Voicemail turns traditional voicemail into a profitable, modern service.

The loss of any of our major customers or decisions by a significant customer to substantially reduce purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Customer Service and Technical Support
 We provide technical support and customer service through our online knowledge base, via email, and live chat. OEM customers generally provide their own primary customer support functions and rely on us for support to their own technical support personnel.
Product Development
 The software industry, particularly the wireless market, is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in technology and user needs. We work closely with industry groups and customers, both current and potential, to help us anticipate changes in technology and determine future customer needs. Software functionality depends upon the capabilities of the hardware. Accordingly, we maintain engineering relationships with various hardware manufacturers and we develop our software in tandem with their product development. Our engineering relationships with manufacturers, as well as with our major customers, are central to our product development efforts. We remain focused on the development and expansion of our technology, particularly in the wireless space. Research and development expenditures amounted to $15.9 million, $13.9 million, and $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Manufacturing
 Manufacturing is for our Graphics physical products.  Our product development group produces a product master for each product that is then duplicated and packaged into products by the manufacturing organization. All product components are purchased by our personnel in our Aliso Viejo, California facility. Our manufacturing is subcontracted to outside vendors and includes the replication of CD-ROMs and the printing of documentation materials. Assembly of the final package is completed by our Aliso Viejo, California facility.
Competition
 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. These conditions create new opportunities for Smith Micro, as well as for our competitors, and we expect new competitors to enter the market. We will not only compete with other software vendors for new customer contracts, we will also compete to acquire technology and qualified personnel.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the mobile software market include domain expertise, product features, usability, quality, price, customer service, and effective sales and marketing efforts. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors, there can be no assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. We also believe that the market for our software products has been and will continue to be characterized by significant price competition. A material reduction in the price of our products could negatively affect our profitability.
 Many existing and potential customers have the resources to develop products that compete directly with our products. As such, these customers may opt to discontinue the purchase of our products in the future. With this as background, our future performance is substantially dependent upon the extent to which existing customers elect to purchase software from us rather than design and develop their own software.
 Proprietary Rights and Licenses
 Our success and ability to compete is dependent upon our software code base, our programming methodologies and our other intellectual properties. To protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, patents, copyright and trademark law that may afford only limited protection. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 93 issued U.S. patents. These patents are intended to 
 9

provide generalized protection of our intellectual property technology base and we will continue to apply for various patents and trademarks in the future as we deem necessary to protect our intellectual property technology base.
 We seek to avoid unauthorized use and disclosure of our proprietary intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code. The deterrent steps that we have taken to protect our proprietary technology may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or prevent the successful assertion of any adverse claim against us relating to software or intellectual property utilized by us. In addition, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or take effective steps to enforce those rights.
 In selling our products, we primarily rely on “shrink wrap” licenses that are not signed by licensees and may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Accordingly, the means we currently use to protect and enforce all of our proprietary rights and intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop competitive technology similar to ours. We also license technology on a non‑exclusive basis from several companies for inclusion in our products and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. If we are unable to continue to license these technologies or to license other necessary technologies for inclusion in our products, or such third party technologies become subject to claims directed to or against the third party technologies used by us, or if we experience substantial increases in royalty payments under these third party licenses, our business could be materially and adversely affected.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 173 employees within the following departments: 109 in engineering, 28 in sales and marketing, 13 in operations and customer support, and 23 in management and administration. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relationships with our employees are good.
