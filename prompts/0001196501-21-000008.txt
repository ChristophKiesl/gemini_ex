Item 1. Business
Founded in 1974, HMS is an industry-leading provider of cost containment and analytical solutions in the healthcare marketplace. Our mission is to make healthcare work better for everyone. We use data, technology, analytics and in-house expertise to deliver coordination of benefits, payment integrity and population health management solutions that help healthcare organizations reduce costs, improve health outcomes and drive the value of healthcare. We provide a broad range of payment accuracy solutions to government and commercial healthcare payers, including coordination of benefits services, to ensure that the right payer pays the claim, and payment integrity services that identify and correct improper healthcare billings and payments. Our population health management solutions include a multi-layered integrated portfolio of risk analytics, engagement and care management solutions that provide healthcare organizations the tools to address the needs of the whole person and improve the quality, cost, experience and outcomes of their entire population. Through our solutions, we help move healthcare forward by saving billions of healthcare dollars while helping consumers lead healthier lives.
We currently operate as one business segment with a single management team that reports to the Chief Executive Officer. HMS began its operations as Health Management Systems, Inc., which became our wholly owned subsidiary in March 2003 when we assumed its business in connection with the adoption of a holding company structure. We incorporated in the State of New York in October 2002 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in July 2013. Our principal executive offices are located at 5615 High Point Drive, Irving, Texas 75038, and our telephone number is (214) 453-3000. Our website is www.hms.com.
During fiscal year 2020, our business continued to evolve through a combination of targeted acquisitions and strategic investments. In November 2020, we made an additional investment in MedAdvisor, an Australian-based digital medication adherence company, reinforcing our strategic relationship and efforts to expand internationally and into new markets. In December 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire Lorica, a leading healthcare payment accuracy and data analytics company based in Australia. The transaction closed in January 2021. The addition of Lorica further strengthens our ability to apply advanced data and payment analytics to deliver significant cost savings and value to our clients and bolsters our reach into the Australian market.
Proposed Transaction with Gainwell
On December 20, 2020, we entered into the Merger Agreement wherein Gainwell will acquire HMS. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into HMS, with HMS continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Gainwell. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the HMS Board of Directors, HMS shareholders will receive $37.00 in cash per share. 
The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. The consummation of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of HMS's common stock outstanding and entitled to vote as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including compliance with or performance, in all material respects, or in certain instances, in all respects, by each party of its covenants and obligations under the Merger Agreement. The Merger is anticipated to close in the first half of 2021.

COVID-19 Pandemic
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, which has spread globally and throughout the United States. The course of COVID-19, including the responses to the pandemic and its effects, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption in economic and normal business activities globally. It has also impacted our day-to-day operations and the operations of the vast majority of our customers, suppliers and partners. Although the pandemic has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date, it did impact our financial results for 2020. The degree to which COVID-19 affects our future financial results and operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. These uncertainties, include, among others, the recurrence, severity or duration of the ongoing pandemic, current or future domestic and international actions to contain and treat COVID-19, or their impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Due to the speed with which the situation may change, we are not able to estimate the effect of COVID-19 on our financial results and operations at this time, but the effect could be material for fiscal year 2021 or during any future period affected directly or indirectly by this pandemic. For further discussion of the risks relating to COVID-19, see the “Risk Factors” section set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this 2020 Form 10-K.
Our Solutions
We provide solutions that apply broadly across the Medicaid, Medicare, commercial at-risk and employer self-insured markets. Our services span the payment and care continuum, from an individual’s enrollment in a healthcare program to pre-payment review of their claims, through post-payment identification and recovery of improper payments, and back to the individual where our consumer-driven solutions allow healthcare organizations to manage individuals' healthcare on a personal level, and at scale, using actionable analytics that drive individuals to take actions that improve health outcomes. Our coordination of benefits and payment integrity services ensure payment accuracy by addressing a wide spectrum of payment errors, including eligibility and coordination of benefits errors, the identification and investigation of potential fraud, and the review of claims on a prepayment and post-payment basis for improper payments and utilization effectiveness. Our population health management services assist customers in managing quality, risk, cost and compliance across all lines of business by engaging consumers, providing the tools to manage their care, and identifying existing or emerging health risk among consumer populations. Through our industry-leading technology, analytics and engagement solutions, we save billions of dollars annually while helping consumers lead healthier lives.
Our comprehensive solutions offer value throughout the healthcare continuum and include the following:
Coordination of Benefits (COB)
HMS provides a comprehensive, integrated suite of COB solutions to healthcare organizations, including Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, healthcare exchanges, commercial payers and other at-risk entities. We deliver high value to our customers by delivering timely and accurate information about members' other insurance coverage, which enables our customers to better coordinate care, maximize cost savings, ensure accurate reimbursement and reduce administrative rework. We provide verified insurance coverage information as early as the point of enrollment, as well as at the point of prior authorization, or prior to the payment of a claim, to maximize cost avoidance. We pursue recovery for any healthcare claim for which another party was liable to pay first. Experience and analytics inform our ability to accurately identify those claims and deploy workflows and processes that ensure we recover the maximum amount of inappropriately paid expenditures for our customers. 
We also assist customers in identifying other third-party insurance and recovering medical expenses where a member is involved in a casualty or tort incident. For Medicaid agencies exclusively, we provide estate recovery services to identify and recover Medicaid expenditures from the estates of deceased Medicaid members, in accordance with state policies. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our COB services represented 69.7%, 64.5% and 66.4% of our total revenue, respectively.
Payment Integrity (PI)
Our PI solutions and services employ advanced data analytics, leading technologies and clinical expertise to maximize savings and deliver proven, measurable results for federal and state governments, commercial health plans, and other at-risk or self-insured entities. We help our customers identify and avoid improper payments, recover those overpayments when they occur, detect and prevent fraud, ensure compliance with regulations, and increase cost savings with innovative technology and processes. Our PI solutions, delivered on a pre- and post-pay basis across all claims and provider types, are data-driven and stakeholder-sensitive, resulting in better payment accuracy, lower administrative costs, and decreased incidents of fraud and abuse. We leverage predictive and prescriptive analytics, AI, NLP, and ML, and incorporate RPA into our operations for increased efficiency and operational effectiveness. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our PI services represented 22.6%, 25.9% and 24.1% of our total revenue, respectively.
Payment accuracy revenue consists of revenue for our COB and PI solutions.
Population Health Management (PHM)
HMS' comprehensive PHM solutions reduce cost, enhance engagement and improve outcomes throughout the member lifecycle. Our flexible, scalable architecture and modular platform integrates early risk identification, advanced analytics, multi- channel outreach and care management components to help our customers target the right members at the right time for interventions, with outreach that drives action and change. Our prescriptive approach leverages AI, ML, NLP 
and efficacy studies to proactively manage care for all members, drive better outcomes and quality scores, and enhance member satisfaction and retention, while reducing administrative and medical spend. Our PHM solutions enable our customers to understand the health of their unique populations in real-time, and identify future risks, then develop personalized care plans and actionable engagement programs for maximum return on investment. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our PHM services represented 7.7%, 9.6% and 9.5%, of our total revenue, respectively.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others is important to our business and competitive position. We establish and protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property through a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, domain names and trade secrets, as well as through contractual rights, including confidentiality, non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other security measures.
As of December 31, 2020, our patent portfolio is comprised of approximately 90 domestic and international patents, and we are currently pursuing several patent applications in the United States and around the world. Our principal trademarks are our company name and corresponding design marks, including but not limited to HMS®, Accent®, Eliza®, Essette® and VitreosHealth®, and our key product marks, such as Elli®, FraudCapture®, HMS 360®, SolarisPlus®, COBManager® and other marks for our products. We also hold copyrights relating to certain aspects of our solutions and services. While we consider all of our intellectual and proprietary rights important to HMS, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark, license or other intellectual property right.
Customers
We provide our solutions to customers across a broad range of entities within the healthcare industry, including state and federal government agencies, health plans and PBMs, healthcare exchanges, employers, at-risk providers and ACOs, and other healthcare organizations. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our total revenue was $673.3 million, $626.4 million and $598.3 million, respectively. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue during any period presented.
The composition of our 10 largest customers changes periodically. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our 10 largest customers represented 42.0%, 42.7% and 41.4% of our total revenue, respectively. We provide services under contracts (or subcontracts) that contain various revenue structures, including contingent revenue and to a lesser extent fixed-fee arrangements as well as cost-plus and time-and-materials pricing. The current terms of many of our federal and state government contracts range from one to five years, including renewal terms at the option of the customer. In many instances, we provide our services pursuant to agreements that are subject to periodic reprocurements. Several of our contracts, including those with some of our largest customers, may be terminated for convenience, in whole or in part, by the customer. Because we provide our services pursuant to agreements that are 
open to competition from various businesses in the U.S. healthcare arena, we cannot provide assurance that our contracts, including those with our largest customers, will not be terminated for convenience or awarded to other parties. Additionally, we cannot provide assurance that any contracts that are renewed will have the same fee structures as the expiring contracts or otherwise be on satisfactory terms. The early termination of key contracts with significant customers, or the inability to renew such contracts on favorable terms or at all, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
In providing solutions and services to our customers, we rely heavily upon our technology systems and networks, as well as on those of third-party providers, to process, transmit, maintain, store and host the confidential, proprietary and sensitive information and data we receive from our customers and other data suppliers, including private insurance plans and financial institutions. The secure processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Although we have spent significant resources to implement security and privacy programs and controls, train our workforce and enhance our security measures with the implementation of new technologies and processes, our information technology and infrastructure, and those of third parties on which we rely , could continue to be potentially subject to various forms of cyber-attacks, as further discussed under the heading “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Healthcare Landscape
The market for cost containment solutions is large and growing, driven by increasing healthcare costs, rising program enrollment and payment complexities. Established in 1965 under the Social Security Act, Medicaid provides health insurance and long-term care services and support to low-income families and individuals with disabilities in the United States. Medicaid is funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created CHIP to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for Medicaid, yet not enough to afford private health insurance. Medicare is a federal program that is administered by CMS, and provides eligible persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons with a variety of hospital, medical insurance and prescription drug benefits. All three of these programs have opted to contract with managed care organizations, or MCOs, in whole or in part as a means of delivering quality healthcare to program beneficiaries and controlling costs.
By law, Medicaid programs serve as the payer of last resort and all other sources of coverage must pay for medical costs incurred by a Medicaid-eligible individual. The TPL rules of the Medicaid statute require, among other things, that states take reasonable measures to identify potentially liable third parties and process claims accordingly. Since 1985, we have provided state Medicaid agencies with services to identify third parties with primary liability for paying claims for Medicaid members, and since 2005, we have provided similar services to Medicaid managed care plans.
The Deficit Reduction Act enacted by Congress in 2006 contained provisions to strengthen the TPL rules and created the Medicaid Integrity Program under the Social Security Act to increase the government’s capacity to prevent, detect and address fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicaid program. Later that year, Congress passed the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, which established the Medicare RAC program. These measures, at both the federal and state level, have strengthened our ability to identify and recover erroneous payments on behalf of our customers. We became the Medicare RAC for Region D with our acquisition of HealthDataInsights, Inc. (“HDI”) in 2011 and again were awarded a region under the new Medicare RAC contracts in October 2016. We also serve as a Medicaid RAC to certain states pursuant to provisions of the ACA.
The ACA, generally referred to as “Obamacare,” was signed into law on March 23, 2010. The law aimed to decrease the uninsured population in the U.S. by expanding Medicaid, enabling access to healthcare coverage through health insurance exchanges, and mandating coverage for pre-existing conditions and other healthcare situations. It is estimated that 20 million people have gained healthcare coverage as a result of the ACA.
For 2021, Medicare and Medicaid are projected to pay approximately 38.6% of the nation’s healthcare expenditures and serve over 147.5 million beneficiaries. Many of these beneficiaries are enrolled in managed care plans, which have the responsibility for both patient care and claims adjudication. The dual aims of cost containment and quality healthcare outcomes are the same across all at-risk entities, including commercial health plans and government healthcare programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare.
Within the commercial market, health plans sell policies directly to individuals (on the open market or via health insurance exchanges), contract with employers to underwrite their employees’ care, or contract with self-insured employers to oversee benefit administration for their employees. This market also includes a growing number of risk bearing provider-sponsored plans that operate and market health plan benefits. According to CMS NHE projections, private health insurance covered approximately 200.4 million individuals at a cost of approximately $1.36 trillion in 2020.
Several commercial health plans also offer government-sponsored lines of business, including partnering with Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP to oversee care delivery for beneficiaries enrolled in those programs. States continue to focus on improving value, quality and outcomes through arrangements with MCOs. As of September, 2020, 40 Medicaid programs operated with some form of managed care and comprehensive risk-based managed care continues to be the predominant delivery system for Medicaid services in the U.S. More than two-thirds of beneficiaries nationally receive most or all of their care through risk-based MCOs and more than half of states that contract with MCOs enroll 75% or more of their Medicaid beneficiaries in MCOs. Managed care health plans continue to assume risk for Medicare lives, with approximately one in three (39%) of all Medicare beneficiaries – 24.1 million people out of 61.7 million Medicare beneficiaries overall, enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans in 2020.
HMS continues to serve government agency fee-for-service programs at the state and federal level. These plans are generally reliant on and susceptible to the government appropriations process that determines their budget and governs the number of beneficiaries they serve. According to the CMS NHE projections, Medicare programs in 2020 covered approximately 61.7 million people at a cost of approximately $858.5 billion and Medicaid/CHIP covered approximately 82.8 million people, costing approximately $669.1 billion. Altogether, it is projected that the government programs we serve covered approximately 144.5 million people at a total cost of nearly $1.53 trillion in 2020.
CMS projects that Medicare enrollment growth will increase by 2.9% in 2021, with expenditures to increase by 7.5% in 2021 compared to 2020; and Medicaid/CHIP enrollment growth will increase by 1.4% in 2021, with expenditures to increase by 5.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. As commercial and government health plans focus on strategies to contain costs across their different lines of business, HMS will continue offering solutions to meet their evolving needs.
Regulatory Environment
As a healthcare analytics and technology company, our business is heavily regulated and subject to complex and evolving laws, regulations and standards. In the U.S., we must adhere to local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to: privacy and data security, including but not limited to, HIPAA and substance abuse confidentiality regulations, HITECH and the Final Omnibus Privacy, Security, Breach Notification and Enforcement Rule, and the Massachusetts Standards for the Protection of Personal Information of Residents of the Commonwealth; labor and employment relations, including equal opportunity and affirmative action; prompt pay statutes; healthcare fraud, waste and abuse, including the federal anti-kickback statute and the federal False Claims Act; and similar state statutes and legislation. 
As we expand into different areas of the healthcare industry, we may deliver new and enhanced solutions or enter into new markets that may further expose us to requirements under additional statutes and legislative schemes that have previously not been relevant to our business, such as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and other banking and credit reporting statutes, and certain consumer laws and regulations, including TCPA and similar state and federal laws on audio and telephone recording practices. We are also obligated by our contractual requirements with customers, 
which may require that we comply with additional privacy regulations imposed upon certain types of customers, such as the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. In instances where we contract with federal and state governmental agencies directly, or the payment we receive for our services is paid by such government parties, we must also comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and similar federal and state procurement laws, which regulate the solicitation, award, administration and performance of government contracts. 
Outside of the U.S., we must comply with the local and foreign laws and regulations in the jurisdiction in which we operate, as well as U.S. laws that apply to doing business internationally. These regulations involve matters concerning, among others: local and cross-border taxation; anticorruption, anti-competition, anti-bribery laws and other laws prohibiting payments to governmental officials, such as FCPA; immigration; government compliance and licensing; securities regulation; internal and disclosure control obligations; import/export controls; trade restrictions; conflict of interest; working conditions, health and safety, wage-and-hour standards and other employment regulations; environmental standards; intellectual property rights; and data privacy and protection, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and Australia’s Privacy Act 1988 and Australian Privacy Principles, and cross-border data transfers.
Competitors
The U.S. healthcare marketplace is a dynamic industry with a range of businesses currently offering cost containment services, both directly or indirectly (through subcontracting), to some or all of the various healthcare payers, providers, employers and consumers. In addition, with improvements in technology and the growth in healthcare spending, new businesses are incentivized to enter this marketplace. Many customers also have the ability to perform some or all of the needed cost containment services themselves and choose to exercise that option to varying degrees. Therefore, competition is robust as customers have many alternatives available to them in their effort to contain healthcare costs.
We compete based on a variety of factors, including our ability to provide a broad range of solutions that span the entire healthcare claims payment and care services continuum. These include payment accuracy solutions focused on COB and PI related functions, as well as PHM solutions that support the ability of payers to better understand and engage consumers, perform effective outreach, and impact both costs and health outcomes. 
The evolution of targeted strategic acquisitions and investments, coupled with innovative internal product development and enhancement, has led to HMS being a diversified, full services solution provider. During the course of 2020, we focused on innovating and rolling out new and enhanced offerings in each line of business. In coordination of benefits, we introduced our Coverage on Demand solution and continued to scale Medicare-to-commercial and commercial-to-commercial COB solutions. We saw success in PI with our emerging solutions offering, and progress is ongoing with new client implementations underway for our Pre-payment Clinical Claim Review and Episode of Care solutions. In PHM, we introduced crisis management solutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to invest resources and capital towards accelerating the development and market penetration of our fully integrated PHM platform, pharmacy solutions and whole person-consumer, centric offerings.
We have a proven record of delivering results that optimize savings and recoveries, enabled by:
▪in-depth government and commercial healthcare program experience and market leadership;
▪a nationally-acclaimed technology team with analytics, engineering, infrastructure and security expertise;
▪robust data assets that drive high value solutions;
▪prescriptive and predictive analytics, applied across Medicaid, Medicare and commercial at-risk populations;
▪an experienced team of clinical experts, supported by a panel of credentialed physicians from all specialties with deep healthcare policy, program and claims expertise; 
▪ongoing investments in technology innovation in big data, AI, ML, NLP and RPA;
▪long-term, multi-level relationships with customers and other industry stakeholders; and
▪an ability to provide customers with actionable intelligence to help improve quality, financial and health outcomes, optimize patient and member engagement, and better manage costs.
Our competitors range in size from large, diversified national companies, to small, specialized firms. Some of these competitors have significantly greater financial and technical resources, and others have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do in certain markets. Within our payment accuracy portfolio of products and services, we compete primarily with large business outsourcing and technology firms, claims processors, healthcare consulting firms, and other vendors who provide some or all of these solutions to payers. In addition, we frequently work with customers who may elect to perform some or all of their cost avoidance and recovery functions in-house. Within the population health management sector, we compete primarily with vendors who provide care management, consumer engagement, and related technology services. Examples of companies with whom we currently compete across our offerings include:

▪ | Accenture PLC | ▪ | Casenet LLC | ▪ | Change Healthcare, Inc. 
▪ | Cotiviti, Inc. | ▪ | Discovery Health Partners, LLC | ▪ | ExlService Holdings, Inc. 
▪ | IBM Watson Health | ▪ | Inovalon Holdings, Inc. | ▪ | Medecision, Inc. 
▪ | MHK | ▪ | Performant Financial Corporation | ▪ | Optum, Inc. (subsidiary of United Healthcare)
▪ | Welltok, Inc. | ▪ | ZeOmega, Inc. | 

Our Business Strategy
We believe that the steadily increasing enrollment and rising expenditures for Medicare and Medicaid, with most new enrollees entering managed care plans; an aging U.S. population with an increasing concentration of individuals with high-cost chronic conditions and often co-morbidities; and the overall complexity of the healthcare claims payment system in the U.S. all combine to create substantial growth opportunities for the suite of cost containment solutions we offer.
We also believe these factors present growth opportunities for our PHM services. We are focused on growing our business over the course of 2021 and beyond, both organically and inorganically, by leveraging existing key assets (e.g., our data, analytics, in-house expertise, and distribution channel) and pursuing a number of strategic objectives and initiatives, including:
▪Expanding the scope of our relationship with existing customers – by selling new, additive and enhanced solutions and services to our broad customer base, including those designed to improve consumer engagement and clinical outcomes, and cross-selling across customer lines of business.
▪Adding new customers – by driving sales enablement and marketing to commercial health plans, including Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage plans, at-risk group and individual health lines of business, and ASO plans; government healthcare payers, including Medicaid agencies, state employee health benefit plans and CHIPs; at-risk provider organizations and ACOs; and commercial self-insured employers.
▪Entering new markets for diversification and growth – by expanding into adjacent markets, such as Medicare Advantage, risk-bearing providers, employer, public health and pharmacy; leveraging opportunities through our international operations to access new markets overseas; developing and launching new and enhanced PI, PHM and engagement solutions targeted at high-growth markets; and strategic acquisitions of and investments in complementary businesses.
▪Introducing new innovative solutions and services – by increasing internal development initiatives designed to enhance and expand our existing suite of cost containment solutions and advance the delivery of a more comprehensive health technology offering.
▪Utilizing technology tools and innovation – by deploying technologies that leverage a big data environment to further enhance our data, analytics, and processes to create operating efficiencies, improve accuracy and quality, increase customer satisfaction, and drive revenue opportunities and scale.
▪Strategic deployment of capital – by investing in our IT infrastructure; internal growth initiatives; capabilities, technologies, and assets to complement our cost-containment expertise; building or acquiring adjacent capabilities to enhance our solution set; and expanding our data analytics capabilities. Our focus may include future acquisitions that represent long-term growth potential, target high-growth areas, are accretive to earnings, enhance our technological capabilities and fill a strategic need in our business portfolio as we seek to provide increasingly comprehensive solutions to our customers. 
Talent and Human Capital Management
Our employees and culture are critical components to our success. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 3,170 employees worldwide, of which the majority were based within the U.S.
At HMS, we live our values every day. We believe these values—customer focus, results-driven collaboration, meaningful innovation, uncompromising integrity, widespread inclusion and absolute accountability—define the character and culture of our organization. We strive to attract, develop and retain the best talent by providing competitive pay and benefits, continuous growth and development, and a diverse and inclusive workplace that positively impacts our people, communities and environment.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment where all employees can be their authentic selves and thrive. In fiscal 2020, we formed a Diversity & Inclusion Council to focus on gender, ethnicity, LGBTQ, veterans, persons with disabilities and cross-cultural diversity. Among its accomplishments, the employee-led Council established a governance framework and expanded HMS' employee resource groups aligned around shared interests, preferences, characteristics and backgrounds, which we believe empower employees, build leadership, promote equity and advance our business strategy. We also help drive diversity through our supplier diversity program. We believe inclusive procurement practices help us create value for our customers and communities. 
We recognize the importance of giving back to the communities where we live and work, and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain an innovative and diverse workforce. Through our HMS Cares program, our people use their talent and expertise to serve those who are most vulnerable in our communities. We also encourage employees to engage and support our communities by providing them with paid time off to volunteer with charitable organizations that address key social determinants of health like hunger, poverty and housing, which align with our mission to make healthcare work for everyone. HMS makes charitable financial contributions to many of these organizations and we encourage employees to do the same by offering company matching opportunities.
Health, Safety and Wellness
We offer comprehensive compensation and benefits that promote and support the health, safety and well-being of our employees and their families to help them build happier and healthier lives. Employees have access to a variety of benefits, including, medical, dental and vision coverage, health and wellness programs, retirement benefits, financial wellness and planning, work/life assistance, telehealth and paid time off. We are also committed to providing a safe, healthy and productive workplace conducive to open collaboration and engagement. 
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, our top priority has been and continues to be the safety and well-being of our employees. Over the course of the pandemic, we implemented a number of precautionary and preemptive measures to protect their safety while ensuring continuity of service to our customers. Our efforts include transitioning essentially all of our employees to working remotely, suspending non-essential employee travel, canceling participation in in-person industry events and group meetings, promoting social distancing and enhanced cleaning and sanitization 
efforts across office locations, implementing protocols to quarantine employees who may have been exposed to COVID-19, or show relevant symptoms, and extending additional paid time off to employees to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine. We also commenced preparedness plans at our facilities to maintain continuity of operations, which provide for flexible work arrangements, and maintain regular communications with our workforce as well as our customers and vendors. Although we have moved to a remote working environment without any significant disruptions to our business or control processes, and believe we are well-prepared to continue operating this way, we have a multi-phase plan to return to working on-site that gradually allows our workforce to return while practicing social distancing and other safety measures. Our management team continues to monitor the situation and manages our response in collaboration with customers, government officials and stakeholders. As COVID-19 continues to evolve, we may undertake additional actions to promote the safety and security of our employees, ensure the availability and functioning of our critical infrastructure, and support the communities in which we operate. Some of these measures may include imposing remote working arrangements for personnel when possible, investing in personal protective equipment, providing paid sick leave to affected employees, and other policies and initiatives that reduce the transmission of COVID-19.
