Our Company
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the “Company,” “Crimson,” “we,” “our” or “us” as used herein refer to Crimson Wine Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries. Crimson has been conducting business since 1991. Prior to February 25, 2013, Crimson was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (formerly known as Leucadia National Corporation) (“Jefferies”). On February 1, 2013, Jefferies declared a pro rata dividend of all of the outstanding shares of Crimson’s common stock in a manner that was structured to qualify as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the “Distribution”). Jefferies’ common shareholders received one share of Crimson common stock for every ten common shares of Jefferies, with cash in lieu of fractional shares, on February 25, 2013. 
Crimson is in the business of producing and selling luxury wines (i.e., wines that retail for over $16 per 750ml bottle). Crimson is headquartered in Napa, California and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries owns seven primary wine estates and brands: Pine Ridge Vineyards, Archery Summit, Chamisal Vineyards, Seghesio Family Vineyards, Double Canyon, Seven Hills Winery and Malene Wines. 
The wine Crimson makes comes from estate grown grapes as well as grapes and bulk wine purchased under contract and on the spot-market. Our business model is a combination of direct to consumer sales and wholesale distributor sales. References to cases of wine herein refer to nine-liter equivalent cases.
Mission, Purpose and Strategy
Our mission and purpose are as follows:
As owners of exceptional vineyards in premier wine growing regions, we are committed to crafting benchmark wines for the pleasure and benefit of those we serve.
Using our three strategic pillars of quality, focus and growth as guides, we seek to enrich lives through uniquely wonderful wine experiences. 
Quality. We own exceptional vineyards in premier winegrowing regions across California, Oregon and Washington. We farm our vineyards in a thoughtful, sustainable way with the goal of producing the highest quality grapes and wines possible. As part of executing this strategy, as of December 31, 2019, Crimson owns or leases approximately 871 plantable acres of vineyard land. The Company continues to assess other opportunities to enhance the quality of our vineyard holdings and wine portfolio.
Focus. We currently own seven complementary estate-based winegrowing operations and brands, with each having a unique varietal focus best suited to its specific appellation and region. We have a group of accomplished winegrowing teams who are each responsible for crafting benchmark wines from their respective premier wine growing regions. Many of Crimson’s brands are issued ratings or scores by local and national wine rating organizations and we believe our scores are a reflection of our focus on what we do best.
Growth. To support our quality and focus goals, all of our teams, including winegrowing, sales, marketing and administrative are driven towards continuous improvement. The direct to consumer business, which continued to grow in 2019, generates higher gross margins and we intend to continue emphasizing opportunities in this distribution channel in order to further our growth. In particular, the Company is placing increased emphasis on digital and Ecommerce opportunities within direct to consumer. Our wholesale distribution channel continues to drive volume sales to a wide customer market. Our wines are available in all states domestically through our network of over 50 distributors, and our export team served customers in over 30 countries through independent importers and brokers during 2019.
Recent Developments
In 2019, the Company made considerable progress in organizational efficiencies within our supply chain. We rolled out a road map to achieve a higher level of sustainability within our wineries and vineyards. We consolidated our direct to consumer efforts to focus our teams on our most profitable spaces and brands. At the end of 2019, Jennifer Locke joined the Company as Chief Executive Officer. Ms. Locke brings more than 20 years of wine industry experience to the Company, with inspirational leadership skills and an industry wide reputation for delivering results and leading high-performing teams.

The wines are sold by Crimson under the Seghesio Family Vineyards brand name.
Double Canyon 
Double Canyon vineyard land was acquired in 2005 in the Horse Heaven Hills appellation in Washington. Starting with the 2010 vintage, the vineyard produced the first wines bottled under the Double Canyon brand name. 
In 2017, Double Canyon completed construction of a state-of-the-art 47,000-square-foot wine production facility in West Richland, Washington. The production facility has an initial capacity of 119,000 gallons which equates to approximately 50,000 cases of wine. Double Canyon shares production in the new facility for certain wines of Seven Hills Winery.
Double Canyon is focused on producing benchmark Cabernet Sauvignon from Washington State’s best appellations. Double Canyon launched the Horse Heaven Hills Cabernet Sauvignon nationally in 2016, expanded into more markets and channels across the U.S. in 2017 and continued to increase distribution in 2018. In 2018, Double Canyon produced its first Cabernet Sauvignon from Red Mountain. During 2019, 124 acres of land, 109 acres of which were fallow land, were sold. As of December 31, 2019, there were 181 acres of remaining land, 93 acres of which were planted with grapes, that were subsequently sold in January 2020.
Seven Hills Winery
Seven Hills Winery was established in 1988 and acquired by Crimson in January 2016.  The winery facility has an annual permitted wine production capacity of up to 48,000 gallons which equates to approximately 20,000 cases of wine. The winery and tasting room are located in downtown Walla Walla in the historic Whitehouse-Crawford building. The 15,463 square-foot facility includes areas and equipment for crush, fermentation, aging, bottling processes, as well as a tasting room and administrative offices. 
In December 2016 the Company also acquired land in the Walla Walla Valley for use by Seven Hills Winery. This land purchase encompassed approximately 108 acres of vineyards and apple orchards. Included in the 108 acres are 21 acres of some of the oldest and highest quality Bordeaux varietal plantings in the Walla Walla Valley. This historic site, considered the original Seven Hills Winery estate acres, was planted by the Seven Hills Winery founder and his father. In addition, within the 108 acres are 14 acres in The Rocks District of Milton-Freewater, which is known for world class Rhone style wines. During 2017 and 2018, Seven Hills Winery replanted certain acres of the apple orchards into vineyards and removed the remaining orchards for either replanting to grapes or to sell off the land. In 2018, 36 acres of fallow land was listed in the market for sale that remained for sale at the end of 2019.
Malene Wines
Malene Wines was created by Crimson in 2016 with the goal of creating America’s reference point premium Rosé with a sole focus on premium Rosé produced in the U.S. Malene Wines sources fruit from specific sites throughout the Central Coast intentionally farmed for world class Rosé winemaking. In 2017, utilizing fallow ground Crimson owns in the Edna Valley, we planted 5 estate acres to Grenache specifically dedicated for Malene Rosé. There are an additional 11 fallow acres in the Edna Valley that the Company could plant to further expand estate grapes for Malene Wines. 
Malene Wines are sold by Crimson under its own brand name and are made from purchased grapes processed at Crimson sister estate Chamisal Vineyards’ winemaking facility. The Malene brand was launched with the 2015 vintage released to limited 
markets in May 2016 and launched across the U.S. in 2017. In 2018, the Malene brand expanded to include new wines which are featured through use of two Airstream travel trailers purchased to help promote the brand throughout the country. In addition, in 2018, Malene Wines created a home and outdoor experience for the West Coast Airstream in the Edna Valley where consumers can join the wine club and gain access to a fresh new series of exclusive Rosés. 
Competition
The markets for luxury products in the wine industry are intensely competitive. Crimson’s wines compete domestically and internationally with premium or higher quality wines produced in Europe, South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, as well as in the United States. Crimson competes on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution capability, and the ultimate consumer has many choices of products from both domestic and international producers. As a result of the intense competition and how uncertain tariffs have been, and may continue to be, there is upward pressure on Crimson’s selling and promotional expenses. Many of Crimson’s competitors are significantly larger with greater financial, production, distribution and marketing resources. Measured in wine volume, the U.S. is dominated by three large wine companies with production largely based in California, representing approximately 50% of the domestic U.S. case sales volume. Further, Crimson’s wines may be considered to compete with all alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages.
Demand for luxury wines can rise and fall with general economic conditions, and is also significantly affected by grape and bulk wine supply. In 2019, the wine industry saw a significant increase in excess wine from previous vintages combined with a softening in the consumption across most wine segments, particularly as spirits and new categories take market share. 
Crimson’s wines are typically sold at retail price points from $16 to $250 per bottle; however, in the wholesale channel, which represented 87% of Crimson’s case volume in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the majority of volume is in the $16 to $30 retail price range.
Business Segments
Crimson reports operating results in two segments: Wholesale and Direct to Consumer. These business segments reflect how the Company’s operations are evaluated by senior management and the structure of its internal financial reporting. Both financial and certain non-financial data are reported and evaluated to assist senior management with strategic planning. The Company evaluates performance based on the gross profit of the respective business segments. Selling expenses that can be directly attributable to the segment are included; however, centralized selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are not allocated between operating segments. Therefore, net income information for the respective segments is not available. Based on the nature of the Company’s business, revenue generating assets are utilized across segments. Therefore, discrete financial information related to segment assets and other balance sheet data is not available and that information continues to be aggregated. Further information about segments, including net sales, cost of sales, gross profit, directly attributable selling expenses, and contribution margin of the segments for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 can be found in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
Sales and Marketing
Crimson focuses on brand development and distribution to increase revenues and profitability, which has included acquisitions of vineyards and wineries and the development of new brands with existing assets and the development of new direct sales outlets.
Crimson’s sales and marketing team coordinates the sales and distribution of its various brands, maintains domestic and export distributor relationships and oversees the timing and allocation of new releases. The sales team has employees in major markets in the U.S. and, where required, has brokers in certain domestic and international markets. Crimson’s wines are available through many principal retail channels for premium table wines, including fine wine restaurants, hotels, specialty shops, supermarkets and club stores, in all states domestically, as well as cruise lines and over 30 countries throughout the world.
Crimson believes that the quality and locations of its wineries and tasting facilities help to create demand for its brands at the consumer level, which positively impacts sales to distributors as well. Crimson participates in many wine tasting and other promotional events throughout the country in order to increase awareness and demand for its products. Many of Crimson’s brands are issued ratings or scores by local and national wine rating organizations, and higher scores will usually translate into greater demand and higher pricing.
Wholesale
Crimson’s wines are primarily sold to distributors, who then sell to retailers and restaurants. Domestic sales of Crimson’s wines are made through over 50 independent wine and spirits distributors. International sales are made through independent importers and brokers. During 2019, domestic distributor sales represented 56% of net sales and export sales represented 4% of net sales. During 2019, one distributor represented 10% of Crimson’s total sales and no other distributor represented 10% or more of total sales.
Direct to Consumer
As permitted under federal and local regulations, Crimson has been placing increasing emphasis on direct sales to consumers, which it is able to do through Ecommerce, wine clubs, and at the wineries’ tasting rooms. In particular, Crimson has been placing increased emphasis on digital and Ecommerce opportunities. During 2019, direct sales to consumers represented 40% of net sales. Approximately 60% of the direct to consumer net sales were through wine clubs, 21% were through the wineries’ tasting rooms and 19% from Ecommerce, special events and other sales. Members typically join our wine clubs after visiting our tasting rooms at our various facilities, or after hearing about our wine clubs from other members. Our tasting rooms are located in popular tourist destinations that typically attract consumers interested in winemaking and travel. Direct sales to consumers are more profitable for Crimson as it is able to sell its products at a price closer to retail prices rather than the wholesale price received from distributors; however, for certain direct sales offers, some of the profit is offset by freight subsidies.
Grape Supply
Crimson controls approximately 871 acres of vineyards in the Napa Valley, Sonoma County and Edna Valley in California, the Willamette Valley and The Rocks District in Oregon, the Horse Heaven Hills in Washington and the Walla Walla Valley across Washington and Oregon. Approximately 763 acres of these vineyards are planted. Crimson expects to continue vineyard development plans for non-producing acreage in California, Oregon and Washington properties. Newly planted vines take approximately three to five years to reach maturity and vineyards can be expected to have a useful life of at least 25 years before replanting is necessary. Depending on the site, soil and water conditions and spacing, Crimson’s experience has been that it costs approximately $10,000 to $130,000 per acre over a three year period to develop open land into a vineyard capable of producing premium wine grapes, before taking into account the cost of the land. During 2019, the average cost per acre placed into service was approximately $48,000 per acre.
In 2019, approximately 38% of Crimson’s total grape supply came from Crimson controlled vineyards. Crimson purchases the balance of its supply from approximately 68 independent growers. The grower contracts range from one-year spot market purchases to intermediate and long term-agreements. During 2019, one grower represented 11% of Crimson’s grape supply.
Winemaking and grape growing are subject to a variety of agricultural risks. Various diseases, pests and certain climate conditions can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of grapes available to Crimson thereby materially and adversely affecting the supply of Crimson’s products and its profitability.
The table below summarizes Crimson’s wine grape supply and production from the last three harvests:

 | Harvest Year
 | 2019 | 2018 | | 2017
Estate grapes: | | | | 
Producing acres | 701 | | 675 | | 686 
Tons harvested | 2,436 | | 2,444 | | 2,008 
Tons per acre | 3.5 | | 3.6 | | 2.9 
All grapes and purchased juice (in equivalent tons): | | | | 
Estate grapes | 2,436 | | 2,444 | | 2,008 
Purchased grapes and juice | 3,950 | | 4,962 | | 4,661 
Total (in tons) | 6,386 | | 7,406 | | 6,669 
Total cases bottled during the year | 313,000 | | 303,000 | | 396,000

The table below summarizes Crimson’s sales of grapes and bulk wine during the last three years:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2019 | 2018 | | 2017
Grapes sold (in tons) | 1,195 | | 1,835 | | 425 
Bulk wine sold (in gallons) | 180,399 | | 244,418 | | 150,759
Total grape and bulk wine equivalent cases sold | 159,000 | | 232,000 | | 92,000 

Total cases shipped were approximately 340,000, 353,000 and 342,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cases shipped are disclosed for informational purposes, but do not necessarily correspond to the vintage year the grapes are grown and crushed. Depending on the wine, the production cycle to bottled sales is anywhere from one to three years.
Winemaking
Crimson’s winemaking philosophy includes the use of the latest industry winemaking advances to complement making wine in the traditional manner by starting with high quality fruit and handling it as gently and naturally as possible all the way to the bottle. Each of Crimson’s wineries is equipped with modern crush, fermentation and storage equipment as well as technology that is focused on producing the highest quality wines for each of the varietals it produces.
Government Regulation 
Wine production and sales are subject to extensive regulation by the United States Department of Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (“TTB”), state departments regulating alcohol production and sale in California, Oregon and Washington and other state and federal governmental authorities that regulate interstate sales, licensing, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising and other activities. In addition, federal and state authorities require warning labels on beverages for sale or distribution in the United States containing 0.5% of alcohol by volume or higher. Restrictions or taxes imposed by government authorities on the sale of wine could increase the retail price of wine, which could have an adverse effect on demand for wine in general. New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees or excise taxes on wine, if enacted, could reduce demand for wine and have an adverse effect on Crimson’s business, negatively impacting Crimson’s results of operations and cash flows.
On January 1, 2018, the 2017 Craft Beverage Modernization Act ("CBMA") became effective as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Public Law 115-97) and made extensive changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("IRC"), including provisions related to alcohol that were administered by TTB favorably impacting the federal alcohol tax rate.  The federal alcohol tax rate changed effective January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. On December 20, 2019, the CBMA was extended through December 31, 2020, maintaining the current federal alcohol tax rates. The previous rate of $1.07 per gallon for wines with alcohol content at or below 14% has been modified to apply to wines with alcohol content at or below 16%. The previous tax rate of $1.57 per gallon for wines above 14% but less than 21% has been modified to apply to wines over 16%. The tax rates for wines with alcohol content over 21% has not changed.
The tax law also allows for certain volume production credits that the Company took which further decreases the Company’s excise tax liability.  The tax credit allows for a credit of $1.00 per gallon on the first 30,000 gallons, $.90 per gallon on 30,001 up to 130,000 gallons and $.535 per gallon on 130,001 up to 750,000 gallons when the wine is removed from a producer’s bonded winery facility. 
Crimson is also subject to a broad range of federal and state regulatory requirements regarding its agricultural operations and practices. Crimson’s agricultural operations are subject to regulations governing the storage and use of fertilizers, fungicides, herbicides, pesticides, fuels, solvents and other chemicals. These regulations are subject to change and could have a significant impact on operating practices, chemical usage, and other aspects of Crimson’s business. The Company is strongly focused on environmental stewardship and maintains a variety of policies and processes designed to protect the environment, the public and the consumers of our wine. Many of the expenses for protecting the environment are voluntary, however we are regulated by various local, state and federal agencies regarding environmental laws where the costs of these laws and requirements of these agencies are effectively integrated into regular operations and do not cause significant negative impacts or costs.
Seasonality
There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement and transportation of grapes. The wine industry in general historically experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues and net income. Typically, Crimson has lower sales and net income during the first quarter and higher sales and net income during the fourth quarter due to seasonal holiday buying as well as wine club shipment timing. Crimson expects these trends to continue. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, Crimson employed 194 regular, full-time employees. Crimson also employs part-time and seasonal workers for its vineyard, production and hospitality operations. None of Crimson’s employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and Crimson believes that its relationship with its employees is good.
Trademarks
Crimson maintains federal trademark registrations for its brands, proprietary products and certain logos, motifs and vineyard names. International trademark registrations are also maintained where it is appropriate to do so. Each of the United States trademark registrations is renewable indefinitely so long as the Company is making a bona fide usage of the trademark. The Company believes that its trademarks provide it with an important competitive advantage and has established a global network of attorneys, as well as branding, advertising and licensing professionals, to procure, maintain, protect, enhance and gain value from these registrations.
Investor Information
The Company is subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Accordingly, the Company files periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Such reports, proxy statements and other information may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549 or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
