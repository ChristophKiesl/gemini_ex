ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview of Our Business
 Recent Developments
 
UVIC, Inc., was incorporated in Nevada on August 21, 2013.
 
On May 8, 2015, UVIC, Inc., filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission Form S-1 to register 7,000,000 shares of our common stock at a per share price of $0.01 on behalf of selling shareholders. The SEC file number of the registration statement is 333-203997. The Form S-1 was declared effective by the SEC on August 7, 2015.
 
Prior to the transaction described below, UVIC., Inc., had limited operating and development activities.
 
Effective August 22, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement for the Exchange of Stock (the "Agreement") with Zoompass, Inc., an Ontario, Canada corporation ("Zoompass") that was incorporated under the laws of Ontario on June 8, 2016.   Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 8,050,784 shares of its restricted common stock to Zoompass' shareholders ("Zoompass' shareholders") in exchange for all the shares of Zoompass Inc. owned by the Zoompass Inc.'s Shareholders.  At the Closing Date, Rob Lee, a significant shareholder of the Company agreed to cancel 7,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, which shares constituted the control shares of the Company.  Other than this one significant shareholder, shareholders of the Company held 2,670,000 shares. As a result of the Agreement, Zoompass is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  The Company has amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Zoompass Holdings, Inc. and the appropriate forms were filed with FINRA and the SEC to change its name, address and symbol and complete a 3.5-1 forward split, which was consented to by the majority of shareholders on September 7, 2016 and approved in February 2017, for shareholders of record on September 7, 2016.
 
All share figures have been retroactively stated to reflect the stock split approved by shareholders, unless otherwise indicated.  Additionally, the Company's shareholders consented to an increase of the shares authorized to 500,000,000 and a revision of the par value to $0.0001.
 
As the former Zoompass shareholders ended up owning the majority of the Company, the transaction does not constitute a business combination and was deemed to be a recapitalization of the Company with Zoompass being the accounting acquirer, accordingly the accounting and disclosure information is that of Zoompass going forward.
 
Effective March 6, 2018 (the "Closing Date"), Zoompass Holdings, Inc.'s (the "Company") Canadian operating subsidiary, Zoompass, Inc., entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") for the sale of its Prepaid Card Business ("Prepaid Business") to Fintech Holdings North America Inc., or its designee.

Zoompass Inc., was incorporated under the laws of Ontario on June 8, 2016.  On October 17, 2018, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with Virtublock, certain net assets were acquired by the Company in exchange for shares of the Company.  The net assets primarily consisted of certain technology IP related to cryptocurrency exchange/wallet, certain strategic partnerships and customer contracts. On March 25, 2019, the name of the company was changed from Zoompass Inc. to Virtublock Canada Inc. (“VCI”).
 
On February 27, 2020, the Company cancelled 44,911,724 shares of the common stock which were issued in connection with the asset purchase agreement dated October 17, 2018 with Virtublock Global Corp. Pursuant to a General Release agreement dated November 29, 2019, the asset purchase agreement dated October 17, 2018 with Virtublock Global Corp. was deemed cancelled and each party acknowledged and agreed that no party has or shall have any claim with respect to intellectual property, software or other assets owned by any other party and that no agreements exist or remain unsatisfied with respect to the transfer of any asset from a releasing party to any other party, and Virtublock Global Corp. assigned and tendered the 44,911,724 shares of common stock of the Company to the Company for cancellation. As the share cancellation occurred on February 27, 2020, the accounting recognition of this transaction, consisting of a transfer of $4,492 from common stock to additional paid-in capital and related reduction in the number of common shares outstanding, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020.
 
On May 31, 2020, the Company closed a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement") by and among the Company, Blockgration Global Corp., an Ontario corporation and its subsidiaries ("BGC"), and the shareholders of BGC (the "BGC Shareholders"). This acquisition gives the Company controlling interest in BGC’s subsidiaries in Canada and India which is engaged in the business of digital wallet deployments, prepaid card platform, blockchain and mobile apps deployment.
 
On September 30, 2020, the Company cancelled 9,330,000 shares of the common stock and 14,845,000 share purchase warrants which was allocated in connection with acquisition of MSS that was a 70% subsidiary of BGC on May 31, 2020. Refer to note 10 and 14 of the consolidated financial statements.
 
The Company has incurred recurring losses from operations and as of December 31, 2020 had a net working capital deficiency and an accumulated deficit. The Company’s continued existence is dependent upon its ability to continue to execute its operating plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the necessary debt or equity financing will be available, or will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, in which case the Company may be unable to meet its obligations. Should the Company be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, the net realizable value of its assets may be materially less than the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded asset amounts that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.
 
During the three months period ended March 31, 2021, the Company completed a private placement for the sale of non-registered shares of the Company's common stock. As a result of the private placement 3,614,685 non-registered shares of the Company's common stock was issued for gross proceeds of $298,355.
 
In August 2021, the Company completed a private placement for the sale of non-registered shares of the Company's common stock. As a result of the private placement 1,200,000 non-registered shares of the Company's common stock was issued for gross proceeds of $96,000.
 
There is no certainty that the Company will be successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or achieving and maintaining profitable operations in the future to enable it to meet its obligations as they come due and consequently continue as a going concern. The Company will require additional financing in the future to fund its operations and it is currently working on securing this funding through corporate collaborations, public or private equity offerings or debt financings. Issuance of additional equity securities by the Company would result in the dilution of the interests of existing shareholders. There can be no assurance that financing will be available when required.

Beginning in March 2020, the Governments of Canada and the United States, as well as other foreign governments instituted emergency measures as a result of the COVID-19 virus outbreak. The virus has had a major impact on North America and international securities, currency markets and consumer activity which may impact the Company's financial position, its results of future operations and its future cash flows significantly. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak and the global responses to curb its spread, the Company is not able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on its results of future operations, financial position, and liquidity in fiscal year 2021.
 
The Company is actively seeking opportunities to enter into partnership or acquire third parties with existing revenue streams. The company is well positioned to achieve this objective and will continue to pursue such opportunities going forward.
 
The Company will remain a Fintech company and continue to develop and acquire software platforms and services to sell to customers globally with a focus on leading edge technologies and software as a service.
