Products
Originally, we specialized mostly on ribbons printing. Since 2017 until late 2018 we stopped the printing business and focused on advising investors on the Asia real estate market, specifically in Cambodia. This is also how we decided in Q2/2019 to enter into discussions about production of medical devices in Cambodia.

On August 28, 2019 and July 12, 2020 we signed the Asset Assignment Agreement which stipulates the acquisition of certain brand and production rights from Prejex Holding GmbH in Germany, which allow us the production and distribution of certain needle free injection devices globally. 

At the time of this document the Company is working with its partners in Germany on an updated version of its needle free injector device. With production capacities on standby, management has also begun the process of preparing update filings for re-admission with the FDA in the USA and, at the same time are in discussions with potential OEM partners for the product´s market roll-out in the Middle and Near East. The Company is determined to start building cash flows in the medical devices area as quickly as possible.

Market Overview
Other than applying our network in Cambodia in real estate and private infrastructure to identify potential production sites, our most recent inclusion of the medical devices space with the needle free injection technology has led us to put more focus on a US market roll-out for the ready produced devices. 

According to Datamonitor Healthcare, 35% of global prescription sales for the top 50 pharmaceutical companies were attributed to injectable drugs, with sales growing at 43% from 2010 to 2018. The combination of the growing importance of injectable drugs, to the phobia caused by needles, the increase in self-administered or “at home” injections, and the rising cost associated with needle stick injuries, provides the dynamics for the accelerated growth of the needle-free or injection technology marketplace.

The global needle-free drug delivery devices market was valued at USD 10.9 billion by 2019, following a 2012-2019 compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.6%. 

In 2019, insulin delivery for diabetes was observed to be the leading application segment accounting for 31.0% of the total market already then. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the total number of people diagnosed with diabetes was 177 million in 2000 and is expected to reach 300 million by 2025. Thus, the rise in prevalence of diabetes and increasing non-communicable diseases has been and is expected to continue to boost the growth of the needle-free drug delivery devices market globally. 

North America was observed to be the largest market for needle-free drug delivery devices and accounted for 43.1% of the total market in 2019. The market is mainly driven by high public awareness about novel drug delivery systems, government initiatives for the introduction of needle free drug delivery devices in community vaccination programs and key players domiciled in this region. Asia Pacific was observed to be one of the fastest growing markets with the highest CAGR of 16.3% during the period from 2013 to 2019. The factors attributed to the growth of the market are opportunities available with a wide range of undiscovered applications and untapped countries with high potential in this geography.

About us

(GSGG) is a shell company currently looking to leverage its managements´ excellent network globally to initiate business activities in highly profitable geographical and industrial areas.
