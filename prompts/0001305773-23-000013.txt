ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a medical technology company and innovator in the orthopedic industry since our founding in 2004. In particular, we believe that we are a leader in the development, manufacturing, and sales of patient-specific products and instrumentation that are individually sized and shaped to fit each patient's unique knee and hip anatomy. The worldwide market for knee and hip replacement products is approximately $17 billion annually. In the U.S., elective total joint procedures are shifting from hospitals to outpatient facilities and ambulatory surgery centers ("ASCs"). We believe that approximately 50% of all primary hip and knee procedures will be performed in ASCs within the next five years.
A key driver in the outpatient shift of orthopedic procedures is the ongoing changes by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"). In recent years, CMS removed key musculoskeletal services from the inpatient-only list, including total knee arthroplasty in 2018 and total hip arthroplasty in 2020. CMS also continues to expand the ASCs covered procedure list, including total knee arthroplasty in 2020 and total hip arthroplasty in 2021. As healthcare costs rise, we believe that governments and government agencies, including CMS, are looking to reduce their healthcare expenditures markedly through reimbursement reductions and cost-shifting to patients.
On January 6, 2022, we announced the launch of our new Image-to-Implant® Platinum Services℠ Program, a premium service offering for the U.S. market. New to orthopedics, this program seeks to address the rapidly evolving demands of the healthcare marketplace where generic products are being commoditized and patients are increasingly willing to pay a premium for personalized treatment options. As of September 1, 2022, U.S. medical facility customers are only able to obtain our fully personalized iTotal Identity knee system through participation in our Image-to-Implant Platinum Services℠ Program. 
Both Medicare and most commercial payors permit patients to pay out-of-pocket for certain non-covered, deluxe services. Through the Image-to-Implant® Platinum Services℠ Program, we are bringing this approach to orthopedics by enabling participating medical facilities to establish and offer patients an out-of-pocket services upgrade to obtain the Company’s fully personalized iTotal Identity™ knee system. Combined with our new Made-to-Measure Identity Imprint™ knee system, we believe that we now address multiple market segments within knee arthroplasty:
•the Identity Imprint™ knee system provides a data-informed high-quality knee implant system that provides a level of personalization through its patient-specific instruments ("PSI") and proprietary algorithms for pre-surgical planning, but is only available in pre-designed standard sizes, all at a price comparable to standard off-the-shelf options; and
•the Image-to-Implant® Platinum Services℠ Program gives patients in the United States the opportunity to upgrade to a fully-personalized iTotal Identity™ knee implant system by paying an incremental deluxe services fee.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had sold a total of more than 149,000 knee implants worldwide, including more than 123,000 total knee implants and 26,000 partial knee implants. In multiple clinical studies, iTotal CR, our cruciate-retaining total knee replacement implant, demonstrated superior clinical outcomes, including with respect to function, kinematics and objective functional measures, and greater patient satisfaction compared to those of standard, or off-the-shelf, implants that it was tested against. On August 16, 2021, the first procedure was performed using the Imprint knee replacement system. Imprint, available in both cruciate retaining ("CR") and posterior stabilized ("PS") implants, utilizes a proprietary algorithm to select the appropriate implant size from 12 standard sizes that most closely meet the geometric and anatomic requirements of the patient’s knee based on the individual’s CT scan. As with Conformis’ personalized iTotal knee product line, Imprint uses Conformis’ sterile Surgery-in-a-Box delivery system, which we believe provides ASCs and hospitals with greater procedural efficiency and improved sterilization cost savings over comparable systems. With the growing interest in our Imprint system from ASC customers, we have prioritized applying our porous-coated technology to the Imprint system which will be our first cementless TKA product offering. We are targeting a limited commercial launch of the porous-coated technology in the second half of 2023, however the launch may be delayed to the first half of 2024 due to regulatory and/or technical challenges.
On November 11, 2019, we entered full commercial launch of the Conformis personalized hip system, now branded as Cordera Rx. Since the launch of the personalized hip system, we have introduced multiple product line extensions including Cordera Standard, Cordera Pro and Cordera Match. In November 2022, we completed the first 
procedure using our Actera™ Hip System, a second hip stem within our hip portfolio. The system, designed for hip reconstruction, uses the cutting-edge tri-taper stem design, and features a range of sizes and angles derived from our data analytics. This cementless hip stem component features a proximally coated titanium spray with a hydroxyapatite layer to encourage initial and long-term fixation. We believe that the system’s tri-taper stem design will enable surgeons to treat a broader range of patient anatomies and the shorter length options offer easier access to the femur while maintaining the fixation and integrity required for long term success of the implant. For the initial limited launch, the Actera™ Hip System will feature a range of standard sizes in both stem and cup components. We plan to launch future Actera™ line extensions that will offer additional personalization options for surgeons to choose what best fits their patients, even for complex anatomies. The new system is currently rolling out to select sites across the U.S., and we currently anticipate the full commercial launch to occur in mid-2023. 
As of January 31, 2023, we own or exclusively in-license a total of approximately 241 issued patents and pending patent applications that cover personalized implants and patient-specific instrumentation, or PSI, for all major joints and other elements of our iFit technology platform. Our intellectual property portfolio includes 60 issued United States patents, 135 patents issued in countries outside the United States, and 46 patent applications worldwide. See "Note H—Commitments and Contingencies—Legal Proceedings" in the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our patent litigation.
All of our currently marketed knee and hip replacement products and related design software have been cleared by the FDA under the premarket notification process of Section 510(k) of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "FDCA"). We have received CE Certificates of Conformity allowing us to affix the CE Mark. 
We market our products and services to orthopedic surgeons, hospitals, and other medical facilities, and patients. We use direct sales representatives, independent sales representatives and distributors to market and sell our products in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Austria, Ireland, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Dutch Antilles, Brazil, Suriname, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, the Sultanate of Oman, Italy, Poland and other markets.
Industry background
Market opportunity
Joint replacement for treatment of osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis is the principal condition that leads to joint replacement surgery. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of the cartilage that protects and cushions key joints in the body, including the knees, hips and shoulders. This causes the bones in the affected joint to rub against each other, which can result in significant and chronic joint pain, stiffness, swelling, numbness, loss of flexibility and loss of motor function. The pain of osteoarthritis, even during the early stages of the disease, can be overwhelming for patients and can have significant physical, psychological, quality of life and financial implications.
An estimated 33 million people in the United States and over 500 million people worldwide suffer from osteoarthritis. We believe that compelling demographic trends, such as the growing population of aging yet active individuals and rising rates of obesity, will be key drivers in the continued growth of osteoarthritis occurrence. The National Institutes of Health (the "NIH") projects that by 2030, at least 70 million people in the United States will be 65 years or older and will be at high risk of developing osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is more common in adults over the age of 50, but the condition and precursors of the condition can be observed much earlier. For moderate to advanced cases of osteoarthritis, a surgical procedure may be required to replace the damaged joint. During this joint replacement, or arthroplasty, procedure, a surgeon removes the damaged bone in the affected joint and inserts an implant as a replacement. The joint implant may replace all of the principal components of the joint, in which case the procedure is referred to as a total joint replacement, or may replace only a portion of the joint, in which case the procedure is referred to as a partial joint replacement.
Joint replacement market 
According to the Orthopaedic Industry Annual Report for the 2022 calendar year, which was published in June 2022 by Orthoworld Inc., (the "2022 Orthoworld Report"), worldwide sales of joint replacement products, including replacements for knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, wrists, ankles and digits outside of trauma, exceeded $17 billion in 2021 and are expected to grow to approximately $22 billion by the end of 2023.
The 2022 Orthoworld Report estimated that worldwide sales of knee replacement products totaled approximately $8 billion in 2021, and the United States represented approximately 65% of total estimated worldwide sales of such products. 
According to the 2022 Orthoworld Report, worldwide sales of hip replacement products in 2021 totaled approximately $7 billion, and the United States represented approximately 59% of the total estimated worldwide hip replacement sales.

The market for joint replacements extends beyond knee and hip replacements. For example, the treatment of osteoarthritis in the extremities, including the shoulder, elbow, wrist, ankle and digits, may involve the replacement of the affected joint. According to the 2022 Orthoworld Report, the worldwide extremities joint replacement market in 2021 was estimated at $2.2 billion.
The Conformis solution
With the rise of healthcare consumerism and the shift in procedures to ASCs, we believe we have a unique product offering and premium service program that can create an opportunity to disrupt the large, existing market for off-the-shelf orthopedic implants. Conformis now addresses multiple market segments within knee arthroplasty:
•the Identity Imprint™ knee system provides a data-informed high-quality knee implant system that provides a level of personalization through its PSI and proprietary algorithms for pre-surgical planning, but is only available in pre-designed standard sizes, all at a price comparable to customary standard off-the-shelf options; and
•the Image-to-Implant® Platinum Services℠ Program gives patients in the United States the opportunity to upgrade to a fully-personalized iTotal Identity™ knee system by paying an incremental deluxe services fee.
For our fully personalized knee products, we use our proprietary iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform to design and manufacture implants that are precisely sized and shaped to fit the unique three-dimensional curvatures of each patient's knee. Identity Imprint provides a level of personalization through its PSI and proprietary algorithms for pre-surgical planning that selects the implant size from 12 standard sizes that most closely meets the geometric and anatomic requirements of the patient’s knee based on the individual’s CT scan. For all our knee replacement solutions, we offer single-use patient-specific instrumentation, which we refer to as iJigs. We believe our proprietary iFit and iJig technology platform is applicable to all major joints.
iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform
Our iFit technology platform comprises three key elements:
•iFit Design, our proprietary algorithms, computer software and design services that we use to design personalized implants and their associated individualized iJigs based on a CT scan of the patient and to prepare a surgical plan personalized for the patient that we call iView.
•iFit Printing, a 3D printing technology that we use to manufacture iJigs and may extend to manufacture certain components of our personalized replacement implants.
•iFit Just-in-Time Delivery, our just-in-time manufacturing and delivery capabilities. We manufacture the personalized replacement implants and iJigs to order and do not maintain significant inventory of finished products. We deliver the personalized replacement implants and iJigs to the hospital, ASC or other medical facility in advance of the scheduled arthroplasty procedure.
Key benefits of the iTotal and iTotal Identity Systems
We use our iFit technology platform to develop personalized joint replacement systems and single-use surgical instruments. We believe that our personalized joint replacement implants offer significant benefits to patients, surgeons, hospitals, ASCs and other medical facilities that are not afforded by competitive off-the-shelf implants.
•For the patient. We believe that our individualized approach offers better clinical outcomes when compared to off-the-shelf implants based on the following measures:
•Better fit.  Using our proprietary algorithms and computer software, we design our personalized knee and hip implants to restore the patient's own native anatomy. As a result, we believe that our implants fit better and regain better function, thereby helping to minimize pain and maintain the integrity of the implant.
•Faster recovery.  We believe an individual fit requires less bone and soft tissue removal by the surgeon, resulting in less bleeding and swelling within the knee and shortened recovery times.
•Better function.  We design and/or plan our implants to match the patient's anatomy to provide a more stable, natural feeling joint. With our personalized knee implant products, we match the patient’s natural "J" curves, corrected for deformities caused by osteoarthritis, preserve the patient's medial and lateral joint lines, and minimize up-and-down rocking and lift-off of the patient's condyles during normal knee movement. 
•Greater patient satisfaction.  We believe that, as a result of our individualized implants fitting and functioning better, patients have greater overall satisfaction with the results of their knee and hip replacements.
•Earlier intervention.  We believe that patients who undergo knee and hip replacement with one of our products typically retain more of their bone during the surgical procedure, as compared to patients who undergo knee or hip replacement using an off-the-shelf implant. The more bone that is preserved, the more likely the patient will have sufficient bone available if a revision surgery is necessary. As a result, patients may undergo knee or hip replacement surgery at an earlier age.
•For the surgeon.  We believe that our solution offers an improved surgical procedure and greater efficiencies for surgeons when compared to knee and hip replacements with off-the-shelf implants based on the following measures:
•Improved surgical procedure.  We believe that the combination of the use of our iJigs with our personalized surgical plan and personalized knee and hip implants enables a more accurate, reproducible and simplified surgical procedure by reducing the number of steps and increasing the precision of implant alignment. In our knee replacement procedure, the surgeon received our individualized pre-operative surgical plan or iView, that indicates where the surgeon makes a predetermined number of cuts that are specifically tailored to each patient and designed to result in a precise fit without the need for repetitive cutting of bone or soft tissue. In our hip replacement procedure, the surgeon receives our individualized pre-operative surgical plan, or Hip iView, that provides anatomical information in advance of surgery that is not available today through the use of standard templating tools. In addition, surgeons have input into our hip system designs within a defined range of parameters to allow surgeons to optimize the Conformis Hip System for each patient, including allowing for leg length correction. Our novel acetabular reaming system interacts with the acetabular iJigs to ream only to a predetermined depth, thereby reducing inadvertent punctures of the pelvis, in a reduced number of procedural steps. An acetabular positioning iJig is used to place the acetabular cup in the position which is intended to optimize anteversion, inclination and anatomical bone coverage of the cup, which we believe will eliminate the need for intra-operative navigation, and also the use of fluoroscopy during the procedure, reducing radiation exposure for both the patient and the surgical staff. 
•Bone preservation.  We believe our knee implants result in the preservation of more bone for several reasons:
•We use our iFit technology platform to design each of the bone cuts required to fit our personalized implants so as to minimize bone resection and maximize bone preservation for the individual patient.
•Our femoral component is fitted using six cuts of the femur as compared to the five cuts typically used with off-the-shelf implants. We reviewed an abstract presented at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the Orthopedic Research Society, which studied stress and fatigue in a six-cut femoral implant model that was thinner than a five-cut model by an average of two millimeters. The six-cut implant model displayed substantially lower maximum stress than a 
five-cut model at a known high-stress location. At the time of the study, two of the authors of this study were our employees, and two of the authors of this study were paid consultants to us. Based in part on this data, we believe our six-cut implants can be thinner than off-the-shelf implants without sacrificing implant strength. We believe a thinner implant requires the surgeon to remove less bone during implantation.
•Our summary of a peer reviewed study of 169 implants published in Reconstructive Review in 2016 indicates that our iTotal CR showed statistically significant less bone loss resection (p≤0.05) when compared to off-the-shelf implants. At the time of the study, two of the authors of this study were our employees, and one of the authors of this study was a paid consultant to us.
As a result, we believe our implants may appeal particularly to surgeons who treat young, active patients. The surgeons might otherwise recommend postponing surgery out of fear that the patient will not be eligible for a revision surgery if one becomes necessary.
•Fewer post-operative issues.  We believe our personalized knee implants reduce the number of post-operative issues. Our review of a retrospective study of 248 patients who had undergone a total knee replacement, published in the peer-reviewed journal Arthroplasty Today in 2017 (the "2017 AT Study") indicates that patients who received an iTotal CR had significantly lower transfusion rates (p=0.005) and adverse event rates at discharge (p=0.003) and at 90 days post-discharge (p=0.023) than patients who received an off-the-shelf total knee replacement implant. We provided financial support for this study. At the time of this study, one of the authors of this study was a paid consultant to us.
•Greater efficiency.  Because of the simplified surgical procedure used with our products, we believe total operating room time is reduced when implanting our knee or hip system as compared to off-the-shelf implants. Our summary of the results of a retrospective study of 70 patients who had undergone total knee replacement presented at the 2015 ICJR World Arthroplasty Congress indicates that average overall operating room time was statistically significantly reduced (p=0.028) for the group of patients who received an iTotal CR in comparison with patients who received an off-the-shelf knee replacement. We believe surgeons can use these time savings to increase their productivity. We also believe the Conformis Hip System will provide reduced operating times as compared to off-the-shelf implants based on both the implant sizing provided to the surgeon in the Hip iView as well as our novel reaming system. 
•For the hospital, ASC or other medical facility.  We believe that our implants provide a better economic outcome for hospitals or other medical facilities through:
▪Improved implant and instrument management and reduced sterilization costs.  As a result of our just-in-time delivery model, we ship our knee and hip implants and iJigs to the hospital or other medical facility in advance of the procedure, reducing the need to store implants and instruments in the hospital or other medical facility. Our hip and knee replacement joint products are delivered directly to the medical facility in a single, sterile, patient-labeled kit, eliminating the need for surgery centers to stock excess inventory for each surgical procedure. Unlike traditional off-the-shelf systems for both knee and hip, our systems require little to no re-useable instrumentation due to the use of 3D printed iJigs as well as 3D printed intra-operative sizing trials. We estimate that a total knee replacement procedure using an off-the-shelf implant requires approximately 6 to 8 double-tiered instrument trays and a hip replacement procedure using an off-the-shelf implant requires approximately 5 to 7 double-tiered instrument trays, which must be cleaned, sterilized and stored between procedures at significant cost to the hospital or other medical facility. A knee replacement procedure using our product requires only one tray of reusable instruments and a hip replacement procedure using our Conformis Hip System uses only 2 trays of reusable instruments. As a result of our just-in-time delivery approach and the reduction in the requirements for reusable instruments in procedures using our products compared to traditional off-the-shelf implants, we believe our products meaningfully reduce a hospital's or other medical facility’s instrument cleaning, sterilizing and storage costs.
•Improved productivity in the OR.  We believe that the iJigs we provide with our implants eliminate many of the intraoperative sizing steps and reduce the number of positioning steps necessary with off-the-shelf products. In addition, our approach of delivering a single-package with pre-sterilized, single-use instruments allows for a more streamlined and efficient operating room through quick and easy set up 
and tear down. As a result, we believe that knee and hip replacements with our knee and hip implants can improve turnaround times with the potential for more procedures to be completed within the same amount of time and for hospitals or other medical facilities to generate additional revenue.
•Shorter stays.  We believe that our personalized total joint replacements may shorten hospital or other medical facility stays. Our summary of the results of the 2017 AT Study indicates that a statistically significantly greater percentage of patients who underwent total knee replacement were discharged in fewer than three days following surgery (p=0.037) in the iTotal CR group (42%) than in the off-the-shelf group (30%). Our summary of a study published in Reconstructive Review in 2019, of 62 patients with either our iTotal CR or an off-the-shelf implant in a “Fast Track” protocol, also indicates that a significantly higher (p≤0.05) proportion of iTotal CR patients (66%) were discharged in less than 1 day when compared to off-the-shelf patients (30%).
•Economic Savings. We believe that our technology offers the potential of significant economic savings to hospitals or other medical facilities and payors. For example, the 2017 AT Study compared adverse events rates and cost of care for total knee arthroplasty patients treated with either personalized individually made implants or off-the-shelf implants. In that study, the total average real hospital costs between the personalized implant and off-the-shelf groups were nearly identical (customized implant $16,192 vs OTS $16,240), suggesting that patients with customized implants received improved hospital outcomes at no additional cost to the hospital. However, risk-adjusted per patient total cost of care showed a net savings of $914 per patient for the customized implant group for bundle of care, including the preoperative computed tomography scan, total knee arthroplasty hospitalization, and discharge disposition. Follow-up care costs demonstrated a savings of $1,313 per patient. Additionally, a retrospective study that we funded reviewed over 4,000 Medicare patients who had undergone total knee replacement, was published in the peer-reviewed journal Orthopaedic Proceedings in October 2018, indicated that the cost of care over a 12-month total episode of care was, on average, $1,697 lower for patients who received our personalized implants compared to patients who received off-the-shelf total knee implants. An abstract presented at the Orthopaedic Research Society 2021 Meeting demonstrated that Conformis iTotal, when compared to two competitive off-the-shelf implants, showed lower direct costs by more than $1,000 versus each off the shelf comparator knee.
•Fewer adverse events.  Many insurers and third-party payors, including Medicare, require the hospital or other medical facility to bear the cost of treating infections and post-operative adverse events if they occur within 90 days following the implant procedure. If reusable instruments are not properly prepared prior to surgery, they are a potential source of costly infections. The lower number of reusable instruments used with our knee and hip implants reduces the possibility of contaminated instruments. Our summary of the results of the 2017 AT Study indicates that use of our iTotal CR statistically significantly reduced blood transfusion rates (p=0.005) and adverse event rates at discharge (p=0.003) as compared to an off-the-shelf knee implant. Our review of this published research, sponsored by us, also indicates that use of our iTotal CR is associated with lower adverse event rates during the 90-day period following surgery (p=0.023). The reduction in adverse events observed during the 90-day period following surgery is meaningful because hospitals or other medical facilities may not be reimbursed for additional post-operative follow-up care during this period.
Our strategy
To capitalize on the shift of elective total joint procedures from hospitals to outpatient facilities and ASCs and to address changing demands of the U.S. marketplace, we have evolved our portfolio and business model to seek to capture greater market share. Key elements of our strategy are to: 
•Increase adoption of Identity Imprint™. In August 2021, the first procedure was performed using the Identity Imprint knee replacement system. Identity Imprint, available in both CR and PS implants, provides a data-informed high-quality knee implant system that provides a level of personalization through its PSI and proprietary algorithms for pre-surgical planning that selects the implant size from 12 standard sizes that most closely meets the geometric and anatomic requirements of the patient’s knee based on the individual’s CT scan. Identity Imprint is offered in a variety of standard sizes and was designed based on our extensive library of individual CT scans. Identity Imprint uses Conformis’ iJig technology and sterile Surgery-in-a-Box delivery system, which provides hospitals and ASCs with greater procedural efficiency and improved sterilization cost savings over comparable systems. Identity Imprint retains many of the benefits of our personalized knee products while reducing the delivery lead time and offering more intra-operative flexibility through standard poly insert options.
•Offer patients greater choice through the introduction of Image-to-Implant® Platinum Services℠ Program. The Image-to-Implant® Platinum Services℠ Program is our new U.S. deluxe services program through which medical facilities and patients can obtain a fully personalized iTotal Identity knee system.
Both Medicare and most commercial payors permit patients to pay out-of-pocket for non-covered, deluxe services. Just as patients can pay extra for a private hospital bed or for a premium intraocular lens, our Image-to-Implant® Platinum Services℠ Program brings a first-of-its-kind premium pricing structure to orthopedics. We believe that the Image-to-Implant® Platinum Services℠ Program offers the following advantages: 
•there is no upfront investment or cost to the provider to enroll in this services upgrade program; 
•surgeons can offer personalization to patients as a shared clinical decision;
•medical facilities can choose to charge patients an out-of-pocket fee for the Image-to-Implant® Platinum Services℠ Program that may include an incremental margin above their cost; 
•as part of the services upgrade, we provide patients a five-year limited warranty from the date of index surgery, underscoring our commitment to both manufacturing quality and superior clinical outcomes.
The market research that was performed indicated that approximately one third of primary knee arthroplasty patients would be willing to pay an out-of-pocket premium for a personalized knee implant.
•Adapt our sales & marketing approach to address the business needs of ASCs. Traditionally, device companies have focused their marketing efforts primarily on surgeons. However, with the shift in orthopedic procedures to the outpatient setting, supply chain leaders and facility administrators now have a wider scope of influence and are looking for partners that can provide effective solutions to support their business operations. In addition, many surgeons are owners of ASCs, resulting in a heightened awareness of the economics of their device selections. In response to this changing market, we have adapted our sales approach and marketing messages to clearly communicate our unique value proposition with our innovative product offering, differentiated deluxe services program, and unique delivery model. In addition, we have deployed focused resources to engage ASCs at the local level, thus creating more opportunities to advance our product and service offering within this segment. 
•Broaden our hip portfolio by launching additional complementary implant systems. On November 29, 2022, we announced that the first procedure with our new Actera™ Hip System has been performed. The system, designed for hip reconstruction, uses the cutting-edge tri-taper stem design, and features a range of sizes and angles derived from our data analytics. This cementless hip stem component features a proximally coated titanium spray with a hydroxyapatite layer to encourage initial and long-term fixation. We believe that the system’s tri-taper stem design will enable surgeons to treat a broader range of patient anatomies and the shorter length options offer easier access to the femur while maintaining the fixation and integrity required for long term success of the implant. For the initial limited launch, the Actera™ Hip System will feature a range of standard sizes in both stem and cup components. We plan to launch future Actera™ line extensions that will offer additional personalization options for surgeons to choose what best fits their patients, even for complex anatomies.
•Expand our manufacturing processes to support the requirements of the new product offering. With the commercial introduction of Identity Imprint, we are expanding our manufacturing operations to support the business requirements that are associated with producing and delivering standard sized implants, while maintaining our unique Surgery-in-a-Box delivery model. In the short term, the expansion of our product portfolio has added complexity to the computer-aided design ("CAD" or "CAD designs") process, the management of our supply chain, and warehouse logistics. Over the longer term, as we continue to add capabilities across our operations, we will be better positioned to address the unique product demands and field logistics of the marketplace, which in turn will provide us with an important competitive advantage. 
•Enhance our patent portfolio and continue to exploit our patent position.  As of January 31, 2023, we own or exclusively in-license a total of approximately 241 issued patents and pending patent applications that cover personalized implants and PSI for all major joints and other elements of our iFit technology platform. See "Note H—Commitments and Contingencies" in the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our patent litigation.
Our products
Knee replacement products
We offer a broad line of primary knee replacement implants, both partial and total. Some of our products are standard products and others are personalized through proprietary software and services to fit individual patients. Historically we have been a personalized knee implant only manufacturer. However, with the introduction of our Identity Imprint platform we offer a total knee replacement system that is available in a range of standard sizes. Surgeons use our family of knee implants to treat mild to severe osteoarthritis of the knee. All of our knee replacement products and related design software have been cleared by the FDA under the premarket notification process of Section 510(k) of the FDC. We also have received CE Certificates of Conformity allowing us to affix the CE Mark to all mentioned products in Europe and applicable geographies for our legacy devices including iUni, iDuo, iTotal CR and iTotal PS. We are currently working on obtaining CE Certification under the new EU Medical Device Regulations (MDR) for our newest product offerings. We typically deliver our knee replacement implants and iJigs, together with our iView pre-surgical planning tool, to the hospital or other medical facility in pre-sterilized packaging in advance of the scheduled arthroplasty procedure.
Hip replacement products
We offer a line of primary hip replacement implants, including stems, heads, liners and acetabular cups. Some of our hip products are standard products and others are personalized through proprietary software and services to fit individual patients. We typically deliver our hip replacement implants together with iJigs, and with our iView pre-surgical planning tool to the hospital or other medical facility in pre-sterilized packaging in advance of the scheduled arthroplasty procedure. However, our hip system standard components may also be used without iJigs or an iView. Currently our hip replacement products are only available in the USA.
Conformis Hip Portfolio
As with the knee, no two hips are the same. They vary in size and shape. As is the case for knee replacements, off-the-shelf hip replacement implants are offered in a limited number of standard shapes and sizes. Also, off-the-shelf hip implants require a large number of reusable instrument trays and the same instrument management challenges and costs of cleaning and sterilization associated with off-the-shelf knee implants. In addition, orthopedic surgery using off-the-shelf hip implants is characterized by a difficult surgical technique and can suffer from a lack of reproducibility in component placement. 
On November 6, 2019, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for our full commercial release of the Conformis Hip System product, and we market-launched the system on November 11, 2019. Similar to the design process we use for our knee implant products, we use proprietary software, to design and manufacture our Conformis Hip System implants and iJigs. After each patient’s CT scan is converted into a 3-dimensional computer model, the unique measurements of each patient’s anatomy are transformed into a comprehensive, individualized, pre-operative surgical plan, or Hip iView, that is delivered to the surgeon in advance of the operation. The Hip iView provides anatomical information to the surgeon that is not available today through the use of standard templating tools. Surgeons have input during the planning process within a defined range of parameters to allow them to optimize the Conformis Hip System for each patient, including allowing for leg length and offset correction. Our Conformis Hip System provides a femoral stem with a patient-specific neck and the planned sizes for the acetabular cup, liner and head. Combined with the Hip iView, our Conformis Hip System allows for improved operating room efficiency and decreased inventory needs of the facility. In addition, our Conformis Hip System includes a novel acetabular reaming system that interacts with the acetabular iJigs to ream only to a predetermined depth in a reduced number of procedural steps. Our Conformis Hip System further includes an acetabular positioning iJig that is used to place the acetabular cup in the position which is intended to optimize anteversion, inclination and anatomical coverage of the cup, with the goal of eliminating the need for intra-operative navigation, reducing surgeon, staff and patient exposure to fluoroscopy. 
We believe the two Conformis Hip Systems will provide clear synergies with our existing line of knee implants because most surgeons who perform knee replacements also perform hip replacements and knee and hip replacement implants are sold through the same distribution channels. Surgeons who understand the importance of personalization for total knee replacements will also be highly likely to embrace true personalization for hips. We also believe our surgical plan and improved surgical technique for hip arthroplasty will attract surgeons who are not current customers. Thus, we believe that the combined Conformis Hip portfolio complements our existing product line and will allow us to expand our customer base, sales force and distribution channels.
Cordera Hip System
In addition to the patient-specific Conformis Hip System, we received FDA 510(k) clearance on August 28, 2019 for an off-the-shelf Cordera Hip System, and FDA 510(k) clearance on September 24, 2020 for an expansion to the Cordera™ Hip System which may incorporate a personalized surgical plan and patient specific instruments. The Cordera Hip System, is an uncemented, primary total hip replacement composed of femoral and acetabular components. The stems are offered in the same sizes as the patient-specific system and come in two standard neck angles and two standard neck lengths. Combined with our existing head and acetabular cup line, we can offer a standard off-the-shelf system, with or without surgical pre-planning and without the wait for personalization. In December 2020, we commenced the U.S. commercial launch of the new Cordera™ Match Hip System, one of multiple planned product extensions featuring the Cordera™ Hip System. The Cordera™ Match Hip System is implanted utilizing a surgeon-approved, personalized iView and patient-specific iJigs.  
Actera Hip System
To expand the sub-categories we compete in, we received FDA 510(k) clearance in September 2022 for the initial standard version of the Actera Hip System. We are seeking FDA 510(k) clearance for an expansion to the Actera™ Hip System which will incorporate a personalized surgical plan and patient specific instruments in 2023. The Actera Hip System, is an uncemented, primary total hip replacement composed of femoral and acetabular components. The stems are offered in a range of sizes and come in two standard neck angles and two standard neck lengths. The sizes and neck lengths were determined by using our CT database of pre-planned cases with previous hip systems. The design of the stem is conducive to direct anterior approach which is one of the faster growing segments of the hip market. Combined with our existing head and acetabular cup line, we believe that we can offer a competitive standard off-the-shelf system. 
Our proprietary iJigs
Our iJigs are personalized, single-use, patient-specific instrumentation. The iJigs we deliver with our joint replacement products include the guides and instruments the surgeon requires to remove the bone and soft tissue necessary to fit our personalized and standard implants to the patient. We believe that providing our iJigs with our implants enables a more accurate, reproducible and simplified surgical procedure by reducing the number of steps and increasing the precision of the alignment.
In a traditional off-the-shelf procedure, the surgeon must have a large number of reusable instruments available because the surgeon does not know in advance the appropriate implant size and which bone cuts and other tissue removal will be necessary to prepare the patient to receive the off-the-shelf implant. A knee replacement procedure performed using our implants and iJigs requires only one tray of reusable instruments, which we provide to the hospital or other medical facility, as compared to a knee replacement procedure using a traditional off-the-shelf implant, which requires approximately 6 to 8 double-tiered, reusable instrument trays, which the off-the-shelf manufacturer provides to the hospital or other medical facility. A hip replacement procedure performed using our implants and iJigs requires only 2 trays of reusable instruments, which we provide to the hospital or other medical facility, as compared to a hip replacement procedure using an off-the-shelf implant, which requires approximately 5 to 7 double-tiered, reusable instrument trays, which the off-the-shelf manufacturer provides to the hospital or other medical facility. We provide our implants with a full set of iJigs in a single package. Our iJigs arrive sterile and are discarded after use.
Human Capital Resources
Our key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting, developing and retaining top talent while integrating diversity, equity and inclusion principles and practices into our core values.
Employees
As of January 31, 2023, we had 295 full-time employees, 23 of whom were engaged in sales and marketing, 29 in research and development, 180 in manufacturing and service, 31 in regulatory, clinical affairs and quality activities and 32 in general administrative and accounting activities. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
Talent Development
We strive to attract a pool of diverse and exceptional candidates and support their career growth once they become employees. Our efforts begin at the entry level with development, including partnering with two- and four-year 
colleges and universities. We also emphasize in our evaluation and career development efforts internal mobility opportunities for employees to drive professional development for every employee, which we believe also drives our retention efforts.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that our ability to retain our workforce is dependent on our ability to foster an environment that is sustainably safe, respectful, fair and inclusive of everyone and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion inside and outside of our business. Our key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting, developing and retaining top talent while integrating diversity, equity and inclusion principles and practices into our core values.
Competitive Compensation and Benefits
We believe in offering our valuable workforce a comprehensive benefits package with rich plan designs and competitive premiums. Some of our offerings include paid time-off with tenure based accrual, paid volunteer time-off, 401(k) plan with company match, medical insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, and annual on-site flu shots, eye exams, and dental exams.
Safety and COVID-19
We take the health and safety of our employees seriously. With the spread of COVID-19 we must remain vigilant in mitigating the effects of the outbreak. In order to be safe and to maintain operations, we have developed and implemented a comprehensive COVID-19 Safety Policy throughout all of our facilities and operations. Our policy includes guidelines for face coverings, cleaning & disinfecting, general hygiene, and the monitoring of cases in our workforce.
Clinical studies
In evaluating the clinical and economic benefits of our personalized knee implants, we consider results obtained from studies sponsored by us, conducted by orthopedic surgeons who are paid consultants to us and conducted independently by orthopedic surgeons, including studies that compare our personalized knee implants with off-the-shelf knee implants. As of January 31, 2023, there have been more than [35] peer-reviewed journal articles and numerous abstracts either presented or accepted for presentation at conferences reporting on the results of clinical studies of our personalized knee implants. Of the published or presented studies known to us that compared our knee replacement product to an off-the-shelf product, most reported either that the performance of our knee replacement product was superior to an off-the-shelf product on the reported measures or that there were no statistically significant differences detected between the performance of our knee replacement product and an off-the-shelf knee replacement product on those measures.
Sales and marketing
We market and sell our products in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Austria, Ireland, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Dutch Antilles, Suriname, Brazil, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, the Sultanate of Oman, Italy, Poland and other markets. We expect that our international activities will increase over the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in additional international markets. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Consolidated results of operations—Product revenue" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of product revenue by geography. We market our products to orthopedic surgeons, hospitals and other medical facilities, including ASCs, and patients. As part of our new business model, in the US, we also offer full-personalization as a premium service and additional revenue stream. We expect to expand the size of our sales and marketing capabilities by entering into additional independent sales and distributor representative arrangements in key territories in the US and abroad.
We offer technical and product focused training programs for our direct sales, independent sales and distributor representatives. We have designed these programs to provide the entire sales force with technical expertise and product knowledge so they may more effectively represent and market our products to surgeons, hospitals and other medical facilities. We believe we offer a simplified surgical technique and delivery model with the use of our products that may reduce the need for our sales representatives to spend time in the operating room during a procedure when compared to the traditional model with the off-the-shelf implant manufacturers. This potentially will allow our sales representatives to spend more time on new customer growth opportunities.
Our surgeon users appreciate the clinical and economic benefits, including increased patient satisfaction, operating room efficiencies and lower adverse event rates, that our products have been demonstrated to offer. In addition, we believe surgeons will increase their interest in the additional patient surgical planning information and improved surgical efficiencies provided by our Conformis Hip Systems. We believe hospitals and other medical 
facilities, including ASCs, will increase their focus and attention on the economic benefits that our products offer, such as fewer instrument trays to manage, clean and sterilize, reduced operating room time, faster operating room set up and breakdown time and lower adverse event rates. We believe patients are interested in returning to daily activities quickly, better long-term satisfaction, and will be attracted to our personalized approach. To engage them, we employ direct-to-consumer marketing, primarily through patient testimonials, social media, search engine marketing, referral campaigns, online, radio and television news reports.
In the United States, we focus our commercial efforts by targeting surgeons and facilities that have the most regional favorable trends such as procedure volumes, surgeon density, and other factors. Part of our commercial strategy is offering the full personalization as a premium upgrade service that is paid by the patient out of pocket. We believe facilities will be interested in this service as a way to increase patient choices and drive increased surgical economics and patient demand. To support these efforts, we offer a comprehensive menu of marketing opportunities to partner with these facilities to increase patient and referral awareness in these markets. Globally, we look for markets with a high volume of total knee replacements, favorable reimbursement characteristics and an historical openness to advanced technologies.
Research and development
Our internal research and development efforts are focused on continued innovation to develop implants for the knee and hip and to assess the application of our iFit technology platform to other major joints.
In our research and development activities, we actively work on:
•new products and services development;
•enhancements of existing products and software;
•improvements in our iFit technology platform to further advance production efficiency and decrease the production time from receipt of an order to delivery of our product; and
•advancements of our iFit technology platform that will enable us to provide our personalized products to a larger customer base, which we refer to as mass personalization.
Our team of 29 full-time research and development employees has extensive experience in biomechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering and software engineering and development. A portion of our research and development activities involves the development of proprietary algorithms and computer software that underpins our entire technology platform. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, company-sponsored research and development expense was $15.3 million, and $14.8 million, respectively.
When we develop a new product or seek to improve our existing products, our team of biomechanical, process and software engineers typically collaborates closely with experienced orthopedic surgeons and other independent scientists. After we complete the development of a new product or an improvement to an existing product, we seek regulatory clearance before selling the product.
Manufacturing
We conduct our manufacturing activities in state-of-the-art design and manufacturing facilities in Wilmington, Massachusetts, Wallingford, Connecticut and Hyderabad, India.
Our design services include the production of unique, individualized, CAD designs on a per-patient basis either in-house and/or through a third party in India. We use the result of these CAD design services to direct a majority of our product manufacturing efforts. As part of our manufacturing cost reduction efforts we have implemented, in 2017 and 2018, we continued transitioning our in-house CAD labor force to the third party in India and, at the end of 2020, we opened an office in India with a CAD team. We manufacture all of our PSI, including iJigs, tibial trays used in our total knee implants, polyethylene tibia tray inserts for our total knee implants, at our facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts. In 2017, we completed the purchase of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Broad Peak Manufacturing, LLC or BPM in Wallingford, Connecticut. Our femoral implant components are polished and passivated at our facility in Wallingford, Connecticut. We outsource the production of the femoral and other implant components to third-party suppliers. Our suppliers make our personalized implant components using the CAD designs we supply.
We have established an approved supplier base that is skilled in medical device manufacturing. Our suppliers are primarily based in the United States. We do not have any long-term supply arrangements and purchase our 
supplies on a purchase order basis. For certain raw materials, including the polymer powder used for 3D printing our iJigs and the polyethylene block used for CNC machining of our tibia tray inserts, we rely on sole source providers who service large portions of the markets for these materials.
In the future, if and as the volume of our product sales increases, we expect to take the following steps in connection with our manufacturing activities:
•develop new versions of our software used in the design of our joint replacement implants, which we believe will reduce costs associated with the design process;
•continue to increase the amount of CAD design activities performed at our India facility to reduce the manufacturing costs associated with the CAD portion of our process; and
•obtain more favorable pricing of certain components of our products manufactured for us by third parties.
We also plan to explore other opportunities to reduce our manufacturing costs.
iFit 3D printing
We believe that 3D printing is especially suited for production of our PSI. We focus on 3D printing as a key element of our manufacturing because we believe it enables fast, cost-effective, and scalable processes that will deliver high quality PSI. As a result, 3D printing plays a key role in our manufacturing operations.
We apply our iFit 3D printing technology to manufacture iJigs using computer-controlled lasers that melt polymer powders into a solid on a layer-by-layer basis until the entire part is completed. The process of melting powders into a solid is called sintering. We use selective laser sintering, or SLS, with approved polymer powders to manufacture plastic components for our iJigs.
Quality assurance
We apply a variety of automated and manual quality controls to our iJigs, implant components and other instruments we supply to ensure that our products meet specified requirements. Members of our quality department also inspect our devices at various stages during the manufacturing cycle to verify that quality to specifications are met. Our quality department audits our suppliers on a set interval and schedule to ensure compliance to appropriate ISO standards, FDA regulations and to our specifications, policies and procedures for our devices.
We and our suppliers are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under its Quality System Regulation, or QSR. The QSR requires manufacturers to establish and follow quality systems consistent with the QSR framework to ensure that their products consistently meet applicable requirements and specifications. In accordance with the QSR framework, we have validated and/or verified the processes used in the manufacturing and testing of our devices. Our Wilmington and Wallingford manufacturing facilities are FDA registered, and we believe that they are compliant with the FDA's QSR. Our quality management system is regularly audited by the Notified Body BSI Group The Netherlands B.V. (“BSI”) against the International Standards Organization (“ISO”) Standard 13485 and the quality system requirements of the EU MDD. Compliance with the ISO 13485 Standard permits us to benefit from a presumption of conformity with quality system requirements laid down in the EU MDD and, in the future, the MDR, as applicable. We are subject to periodic, announced and unannounced inspections by BSI, the FDA, and other governmental agencies. We continue to monitor our quality system and management efforts in order to maintain our overall level of compliance. See "Regulatory requirements" below.
Intellectual property
Protection of our intellectual property is an important priority for our company. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary rights for our products and technology, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our intellectual property position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions related to our products and technology where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
We typically seek patents on inventions relating to implants and iJigs, and on their methods of manufacture. We generally file patent applications in the United States, the major markets in the EU, and in select other commercially important countries. We typically rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary algorithms that we use to design implants and iJigs.

•advancements in implant design applicable to both personalized and non-personalized systems;
•imaging technology;
•3D printing technology for implants and instruments;
•methods of designing personalized implants and instruments; and
•methods of manufacturing personalized implants and instruments.
Licenses from others
We are a party to several agreements under which we have licensed rights in certain patents, patent applications and other intellectual property. We enter into these agreements to augment our proprietary intellectual property portfolio. The licensed intellectual property covers some of the products that we are researching, developing and commercializing and some of the technologies that we use. These licenses impose certain license fee, royalty payment and diligence obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future. We do not believe that any of these licenses are material to our business.

Competition
The joint replacement industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and sensitive to the introduction of new products or other market activities of industry participants. We face competition from many different sources, including major medical device companies.
We compete with several large, well-known companies that dominate the market for orthopedic products, principally Zimmer Biomet, Stryker, DePuy Synthes, Inc., and Smith & Nephew, Inc. These competitors have 
significantly greater financial resources, larger sales forces and networks of distributors, a greater number of established relationships, some of which may be exclusive, with key orthopedic surgeons, hospitals and other medical facilities, third-party payors, and independent sales representatives and distributors. These companies also compete with us in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, the development of our products and recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, engineering and management personnel.
We also compete with numerous other small to mid-sized companies that are developing and marketing competitive joint replacement products, as well as companies exploring alternatives to joint replacement such as biologic injections and cartilage repair systems.
We believe that the principal factors on which we compete with others in our market include:
•the expertise and clinical history of designing, manufacturing, delivering and implanting patient specific instrumentation and implants;
•the breadth and depth of our clinical data-base that allows us to use real world three- dimensional data to design and introduce innovative products that are differentiated from competitors' offerings and represent an improvement over currently available products through better anatomic fit and function;
•Our software artificial intelligence, AI, and data-driven decision making by using real patient data to create an accurate pre-operative surgical plan that is tailored to each patient; 
•the ability to deliver products in a sterile and efficient manner that helps improve the cost effectiveness of the procedure and resource optimization;
•the ease of use of the products and the quality of training, services and clinical support provided to surgeons and hospitals and other medical facilities;
•the safety and efficacy of products and procedures, as demonstrated in published studies and other clinical reports; and
•the reach and depth of each competitor's distribution capabilities.
The prices that we charge our hospital customers for our products vary based on such factors as the volume of product being purchased, geographic region, reimbursement environment and competitive factors. We believe that our current pricing for our products generally is within the same range as that of our principal competitors who offer a standard off-the-shelf-implant, with a premium driven by the personalized in the high single digits on average.
Regulatory requirements
Our medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and other authorities in the United States and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Economic Area ("EEA"). These governmental authorities regulate the introduction of medical devices into their respective geographies within their jurisdiction. The regulations cover the entire life cycle of the product, including the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, storage, labeling, advertising and promotion of the devices. In addition, post-approval monitoring and reporting, as well as import and export of medical devices, are subject to regulatory requirements. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances in the United States, Certificates of Conformity from Notified Bodies in the EEA, and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Review, approval and clearance of medical devices in the United States
Medical devices in the United States are strictly regulated by the FDA pursuant to the FDCA and the regulations promulgated under 21 CFR Parts 800-1299, Food and Drugs, a medical device is defined as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory, which is, among other things: intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes.
Unless an exemption applies, a new medical device may not be marketed in the United States unless it has been cleared by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification pathway or de novo request pathway, or has been approved by the FDA pursuant to a premarket approval ("PMA") application or Humanitarian Device Exemption ("HDE"). The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies according to several factors, including how the medical device is classified by the FDA and the novelty of the medical device. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes depending on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Class I devices have the lowest level of risk associated with them, and are subject to general controls, including labeling, premarket notification and adherence to the QSR. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirement, although manufacturers of these devices are still subject to registration, listing, labeling and QSR requirements. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Specifically in regard to low-to-moderate risk devices that are placed in Class III by default because a legally marketed predicate device cannot be found, sponsors may file a de novo request that, if granted, will reclassify the device either into Class I or Class II and will allow the sponsor to market the device in the US. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed.
To date, we have used the 510(k) premarket notification process to obtain regulatory clearance from the FDA for the marketing, sale and distribution of our joint replacement products in the United States. All of our currently marketed products are Class II devices marketed pursuant to 510(k) clearances. After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or de novo request, or depending on the modification, PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
To date, none of our submissions to the FDA have required FDA review under the premarket approval process nor have any of our 510(k)s required the submission of clinical data. However, we have conducted and continue to conduct numerous post-market studies aimed at demonstrating the clinical benefits of our personalized knee replacement systems as compared to off-the-shelf systems.
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; 
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, validaton control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; 
•labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or the promotion of ‘‘off-label’’ uses of cleared or approved products; 
•requirements related to promotional activities; 
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices; 
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; 
•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and 
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
•unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; 
•customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products; 
•operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
•refusing or delaying our requests for regulatory approvals or clearances of new products or modified products; 
•withdrawing a PMA that has already been granted; 
•refusal to grant export approval for our products; or 
•criminal prosecution.
Regulation of medical devices in the EEA
The EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices(“the EU MDR”) sets out the basic regulatory framework currently applicable to medical devices in the EEA. The EU MDR became applicable on May 26, 2021, repealing the prior Council Directive 93/42/EEC, the EU MDD, which had been regulating medical devices in the EEA for the past over 20 years. This represented a major change in the regulatory landscape of medical devices in the EEA. The EU MDR sets out certain transitional provisions that allow for medical devices covered by the repealed EU MDD (called “legacy devices”) to still be marketed in the EEA for a certain period of time. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the individual EEA Member States, the EU MDR is directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of national implement laws in the individual EEA countries. This aims to eliminate the differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA countries that existed under the EU MDD. The EU MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The EU MDR aims, among other things, to: 
•strengthen the rules on placing devices on the EEA market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; 
•establish explicit provisions concerning manufacturers’ responsibilities for follow-up to ensure the on-going quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market; 
•improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; 
•set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EEA; and
•strengthened rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
In the EEA, our medical devices must comply with the General Safety and Performance Requirements in Annex I to the EU MDR (for legacy devices, this corresponds to the Essential Requirements of Annex I to the EU MDD). Compliance with these General Safety and Performance Requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE Mark to our medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the General Safety and Performance Requirements of the EU MDR and obtain the right to affix the CE Mark, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I devices that have no measuring function, are not sterile and are not reusable surgical instruments), in relation to which the manufacturer can issue an EU Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the General Safety and Performance Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a third-party organization designated by a Competent Authority of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments, which is referred to as a Notified Body. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine products' technical documentation and the quality management system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the devices. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the General Safety and Performance Requirements. This Certificate and the related conformity assessment process entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE Mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EU Declaration of Conformity.
As a general rule, confirmation of conformity of medical devices with the General Safety and Performance Requirements under the normal conditions of intended use of the devices, and the evaluation of the undesirable side-effects and of the acceptability of the benefit-risk-ratio, shall be based on clinical data providing sufficient clinical evidence, including where applicable relevant post-market data. The EU MDR defines “clinical evidence” as “clinical data and clinical evaluation results pertaining to a device of a sufficient amount and quality to allow a qualified assessment of whether the device is safe and achieves the intended clinical benefit(s), when used as intended by the manufacturer.” In light of this definition, manufacturers of medical devices are required to have sufficient clinical data and clinical evaluation results related to their devices. 
Manufacturers are required to specify and justify the level of clinical evidence necessary to demonstrate conformity with the relevant General Safety and Performance Requirements. This level of clinical evidence must be appropriate in view of the characteristics of the device and its intended purpose. For this purpose, Article 61 of the EU MDR requires manufacturers to plan, conduct and implement a clinical evaluation which is defined as “a systematic and planned process to continuously generate, collect, analyze and assess the clinical data pertaining to a device in order to verify the safety and performance, including clinical benefits, of the device when used as intended by the manufacturer.” The clinical evaluation, its results and the clinical evidence derived from it shall be documented in a clinical evaluation report.
The conduct of clinical investigations is mandatory for implantable and Class III medical devices under the EU MDR. These clinical investigations aim to generate sufficient clinical evidence to support a CE marking application with the relevant Notified Body. Prior to carrying out a clinical evaluation or investigation, manufacturers of Class III devices and certain Class IIb devices may consult an expert panel to review the intended clinical development strategy and proposals for clinical investigations. The conduct of clinical studies in the EEA is governed by detailed regulatory obligations. These include the requirement of prior authorization by the Competent Authorities of the country in which the study takes place and the requirement to obtain a positive opinion from a competent Ethics Committee. This process can be expensive and time-consuming.
The EU MDR has increased the scrutiny and assessment rules for high-risk medical devices, such as Class III medical devices. This has notably been translated through the following main additional requirements for Class III medical devices:
•Conformity Assessment based on Quality Management (Annex IX) requires a full assessment of the quality management system and the assessment of the Technical Documentation for each product;
•Additional scrutiny procedure for Class III implantable medical devices pursuant to Article 54 of the EU MDR: Clinical Evaluation Consultation Procedure where in the course of the conformity assessment the Notified Body seeks an opinion from the expert panel designated by the European Commission;
•Drawing up a Summary of Safety and Clinical Performance (SSCP) which must be validated by the Notified Body, made available through EUDAMED database and updated annually;
•Mandatory conduct of clinical investigations as mentioned above;
•Annual updating of the Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) Report; and
•Submission of the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) to the Notified Body via EUDAMED for the Notified Body’s review.
The EU MDR therefore imposes increased compliance obligations for us to access and then remain on the EEA market. 
To date, we have used the CE marking process to satisfy the conformity standards required to market and sell our joint replacement products in the EEA. CE marking of our products currently involves a Notified Body. The Notified Body that has conducted conformity assessments with respect to our joint replacement products is BSI Group The Netherlands B.V. (originally BSI UK).
Even after we receive a CE Certificate of Conformity enabling us to affix the CE Mark on a product and to sell our product in the EEA countries, a Notified Body or a competent authority may require post-marketing studies of our product. Failure to comply with such requirements in a timely manner could result in the withdrawal of our CE Certificate of Conformity and the recall or withdrawal of our product from the market in the EEA, which would prevent us from generating revenue from sales of that product in the EEA. Moreover, each CE Certificate of Conformity is valid for a maximum of five years, but more commonly three years.

Our current CE Certificates of Conformity issued under the EU MDD are valid through December 2, 2022 for our iUni product, May 26, 2024 for our iDuo product, May 26, 2024 for our iTotal PS product and May 26, 2024 for our iTotal CR. At the end of each period of validity, we will be required to apply to the Notified Body for a new CE Certificate of Conformity issued under the EU MDR. 
CE Certificates of Conformity issued under the EU MDR are valid for the period they indicate, with a maximum period of five years. The manufacturers may apply for the validity of the Certificates to be extended for further periods, each not exceeding five years, based on a re-assessment of the manufacturers and devices compliance with applicable requirements. There may be delays in the renewal of the CE Certificate of Conformity or the Notified Body may require modifications to our products or to the related technical documentation before it agrees to issue the new CE Certificate of Conformity.
In addition, we must inform the Notified Body that carried out the conformity assessment of the medical devices we market or sell in the EEA of any planned substantial changes to our devices that could affect compliance with the General Safety and Performance Requirements or the devices' intended purpose. The Notified Body will then assess the changes and verify whether they affect the products' conformity with the General Safety and Performance Requirements or the conditions for the use of the devices. If the assessment is favorable, the Notified Body will issue a new CE Certificate of Conformity or an addendum to the existing CE Certificate of Conformity attesting compliance with the General Safety and Performance Requirements. If it is not, we may not be able to continue to market and sell the product in the EEA.
We and the Notified Body who will oversee compliance with the new EU MDR face uncertainties as the EU MDR is rolled out and enforced by the European Commission and the Competent Authorities of EEA countries, creating risks in several areas, including the CE marking process and data transparency, in the upcoming years. 
The EU MDR introduced substantial changes to the obligations applicable to medical device manufacturers and Notified Bodies in the EEA. As a result, there are less Notified Bodies available to conduct conformity 
assessments under the EU MDR and the number of certification requests has increased substantially. The EU MDR is new and a number of guidance documents are still not available to guide manufacturers and Notified Bodies. As a result, the time needed to find a Notified Body available and go through a conformity assessment procedure has substantially increased. For these reasons, the new EU MDR may create uncertainties for the CE marking of our devices and cause delays to access the market. 
Major Quality System updates, including Clinical Evaluation and Post Market Surveillance, are complete and being rolled out within the Company. The technical documentation updates for our first product to require EU MDR CE marking are underway. Our EU MDR Quality System audit was accepted by the Notified Body and we are currently awaiting the scheduling date for our Quality System audit, which will include witness tests and reconciliation activities during on-site audits to ensure that the quality management system is working properly. We believe that we are compliant with the applicable requirements of the EU MDR.
UK and Brexit
The United Kingdom withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020 (the withdrawal is commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Brexit has created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU. On December 24, 2020, the EU and UK reached an agreement in principle on the framework for their future relationship, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The Agreement primarily focuses on ensuring free trade between the EU and the UK in relation to goods, but does not specifically address medical devices. 
After the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) is treated as a third country. Northern Ireland continues, with regard to EU regulations, to follow the EU regulatory rules. In light of the fact that the CE marking process is set out in EU law, which no longer applies in the UK, the UK has devised a new route to market culminating in a UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) mark to replace the CE Mark. The route to market and the UKCA marking requirements are based on the requirements of the EU MDD. Northern Ireland will continue to be covered by the regulations governing CE Marks. As part of the Agreement, the EU and the UK have agreed to continue to recognize declarations of conformity based on a self-assessment in the other territory.
Since January 1, 2021, the Medical Devices (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 introduced a number of changes to how medical devices are placed on the Great Britain’s market.
The CE marking will continue to be recognized in Great Britain until June 30, 2023 and certificates issued by Notified Bodies designated in the EEA will continue to be valid for the Great Britain market until June 30, 2023. From July 1, 2023, manufacturers must obtain the UKCA mark, to place a medical device on the Great Britain market. Manufacturers must register their devices with the MHRA via the Device Online Registration System, subject to grace periods depending on the device classification. Manufacturers are required to designate an Authorized Representative in the UK and we have designated MDSS as our Authorized Representative in the UK (MDSS-UK RP Ltd.) and the EU (MDSS GmbH). A UK designated Notified Body will be also be required for placing our devices on the market in the UK and we have designated BSI UK as our Notified Body in the UK (and BSI Group The Netherlands B.V. in the EU).
Marketing and sales considerations in the EEA and the UK
In the EEA and the UK, medical devices may be promoted only for the intended purpose for which the devices have been CE marked. Article 7 of the EU MDR prohibits the use of text, names, trademarks, pictures and figurative or other signs that may mislead the user or the patient with regard to the device's intended purpose, safety and performance by (i) ascribing functions and properties to the device which the device does not have; (ii) creating a false impression regarding treatment or diagnosis, functions or properties which the device does not have; (iii) failing to inform the user or the patient of a likely risk associated with the use of the device in line with its intended purpose; and (iv) suggesting uses for the device other than those stated to form part of the intended purpose for which the conformity assessment was carried out.
The advertising and promotion of our products in the EEA is also subject to EEA countries’ national laws implementing Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices. National legislation of individual EEA countries governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices also applies. EEA countries’ legislation may also restrict or impose limitations on our 
ability to advertise our products directly to the general public.  In addition, voluntary EEA and national industry Codes of Conduct provide guidelines on the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Failure to comply with this requirement could lead to the imposition of penalties by the Competent Authorities of EEA countries and the UK. The penalties could include warnings, orders to discontinue the promotion of the medical device, seizure of the promotional materials and fines.
Product vigilance and post-approval monitoring in the EEA and the UK
Additionally, all manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EEA and the UK are legally bound to report serious incidents involving devices they manufacture to the Competent Authority in whose EEA jurisdiction the incident occurred and to the MHRA in the UK. Under the EU MDR, a serious incident is defined as any incident that directly or indirectly led, might have led or might lead to any of the following: (a) the death of a patient, user or other person, (b) the temporary or permanent serious deterioration of a patient's, user's or other person's state of health, (c) a serious public health threat. Manufacturers must also notify competent authorities of any field safety corrective actions (including those undertaken in a third country in relation to a device which is also made available on the EEA market, if the reason for the field safety corrective action is not limited to the device made available in the third country).
Manufacturers are required to take field safety corrective actions, or FSCAs, to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. See "Risk Factors-Risks related to government regulation — If our products, or malfunction of our products, cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions, which could harm our business."
Third-party reimbursement
In the United States and most other major joint implant markets outside the United States, many third-party payors, including government health programs, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, reimburse hospitals and other medical facilities an aggregate amount for all elements of a joint replacement procedure, including operating room time, patient care and the joint replacement product. As a result, our products generally are not reimbursed separately, but instead are subject to the limits imposed by third-party payors on the coverage and reimbursement of procedures that utilize our products.
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of such procedures involving the use of our products cleared by the FDA and approved by other government authorities will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States, such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a particular procedure may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the procedure once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to particular procedures on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved procedures involving the use of our products for a particular indication.
In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to limit payments by governmental payors for medical devices, and the procedures in which medical devices are used. While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability.
In the EEA, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. In many foreign markets, pricing and approval of use of medical devices is subject to governmental control. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these EEA countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular device candidate to currently available therapies. Other EEA countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medical devices, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new devices. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
In recent years, a number of EEA countries have introduced so-called health technology assessments (HTA). HTA measures the added value of a new health technology, in our case a medical device, compared to existing ones. HTA’s assessment include cost implications for the patient and its impact on the organization of healthcare systems in the administration of treatment. An EU Regulation on HTA entered into force in January 2022 and will be applied three years later (January 2025). It offers the possibility for EEA countries’ HTA bodies to conduct Joint Clinical Assessments of new high-risk medical devices.
In January 2021, the rate of reimbursement for surgical procedures using our products in Germany was changed. Beginning January 1, 2021, the reimbursement for surgical procedures using our iTotal CR and iTotal PS products increased by approximately 0.6%, while the reimbursement for surgical procedures using our iUni and iDuo products increased by approximately 8%. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, sales in Germany represented 6% and 9% of our total product sales, respectively. In addition to being affected by changes in reimbursement rates, use of our products for each patient in Germany may also be subject to approval by the Medizinischer Dienst der Krankenkassen (translated: Medical Service of Health Insurance), or “MDK”. Beginning in 2016, we experienced a significant increase in the number of denials by MDK for increased cost associated with the use of our products and, in such instances, the amount of reimbursement to the hospitals and other medical facilities was lowered to that of an off-the-shelf knee. We continue to experience MDK denials of the higher reimbursement code, which continues to adversely impact our sales in Germany. We are working with our physicians and hospitals and other medical facilities in Germany and experienced consultants to appeal MDK denials and demonstrate to MDK the benefits of our products, including patient satisfaction and recovery rates. We have implemented pre-approval techniques in order to seek prior approval for procedures.
Healthcare laws and regulations
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and selection of medical devices for patients. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:
•The federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to arrangements between device manufacturers and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and others. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to apply to anything of value including, for example, gifts, cash payments, donations, waivers of payment, ownership interests, and providing any item, service, or compensation for something other than fair market value. Liability under the AKS may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the AKS protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend medical device products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, advisors and speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit within an exception or safe harbor. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational grants and reimbursement support programs. Violations of this law are punishable by up to ten years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
•The federal civil False Claims Act (FCA) imposes liability, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false statement or record material to an obligation to pay money to the government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers have faced liability under the FCA for providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS also are deemed false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute 
provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement for violations, as well as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
•The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and its implementing regulations (collectively, HIPAA), imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services;
•We may obtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA - other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits - we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly receive individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA; 
•The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Applicable manufacturers also are required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives; and
•Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Several states have enacted legislation requiring medical device manufacturers to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs; file periodic reports with the state, including reports on gifts and payments to individual health care providers; and/or register their sales representatives. Some states prohibit certain sales and marketing practices, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to health care providers. 
In the EEA, interactions between medical devices companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, such as national anti-bribery laws of EEA countries, national Sunshine rules, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. In particular, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is a regulation in the EEA that, among other things, unifies data protection regulation within the EEA and governs the export of certain personal data and health information of data subjects in the EEA. Enforcement of these regulations began May 25, 2018. The FDA has also begun enforcing its Cybersecurity Guidance Document through the review of 510(k) applications to ensure companies are addressing concerns around this issue. Lack of proper documentation on Cybersecurity may delay or prevent clearance of a 510(k), necessitate the withdrawal of a pending 510(k) notice, or cause a filed 510(k) to be placed on Refuse to Accept hold prior to FDA’s initiation of its substantive review.
EU Data Protection Legislation
The EU, EEA countries and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is directly applicable in each EEA country. The GDPR imposes strict requirements and onerous accountability obligations on companies that process personal data, especially if they process sensitive personal data (such as data concerning patient health). The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA, including to the U.S., and fines and penalties for failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA countries. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and 
consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EEA countries may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. The obligations under the GDPR may therefore be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
Financial information about segments and geographic areas
We operate as one reportable segment as described in "Note B—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The countries in which we have local revenue generating operations have been combined into the following geographic areas: the United States (including Puerto Rico), Germany, and the rest of the world, which consists of the United Kingdom predominately and several other foreign countries. Sales are attributable to a geographic area based upon the customer’s country of domicile and distributors managed by that respective country. Net property, plant and equipment are based upon physical location of the assets. Additional financial information about geographic areas is included in "Note L—Segment and Geographic Data" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We are exposed to risks associated with international operations, including exchange rate fluctuations, regional and country-specific political and economic conditions, foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection measures, import or export requirements, tax risks, staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual property protection risks, differing regulatory requirements, government-managed healthcare systems, government-mandated pricing and reimbursement and health technology assessment schemes, government-mandated collection periods, patient privacy laws and regulations, and other data privacy laws and regulations.
