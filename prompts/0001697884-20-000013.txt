Business Plan

We have been engaged in the business of developing and marketing products that promote wellness and a healthy lifestyle since 2019. A change of 100% of CompanyÂ’s ownership occurred effectively on January 21, 2020. As a result, we changed Company name from Shemn Corp. to VitaSpring Biomedical Co. Ltd. on February 17, 2020. Under new management, we ceased producing and distributing leather products. Our sole objective is to develop new drugs of cell medicine. We also plan to establish a GTP cell production center in Taiwan for the production of X.MSC cytopharmaceuticals. The estimated annual output is the amount sufficient for 10,000 people (20 million cells/ does). The GTP cell center is currently under construction. Trial production is expected to begin in June, 2020. Mass production in August, 2020. 
 We do not sell products in a form for use by consumers although we may, in the future, develop products for use by consumers.
