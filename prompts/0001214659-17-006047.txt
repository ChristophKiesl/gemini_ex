What is a Lithium-Ion Battery?
 
A lithium-ion battery (“LIB”) is a rechargeable electric device within which lithium moves from a negative electrode to a positive electrode during the discharge and back charging.  The four main materials typically used in LIB’s are cathode materials, anode materials, operators, and electrolytic solution.  The performance and safety of an LIB depends heavily on the materials from which they are made as their operation is based on chemical reactions which can be directly affected by the materials used in production.
 
LIB’s are one of the most common types of rechargeable batteries as they are frequently used as the power supply for most consumer devices that people use every day such as mobile phones, digital cameras, and power tools. Additionally, LIB’s are also utilized in aerospace applications and automotive products such as electric and hybrid vehicles. The lithium-ion battery has become the more sought-after alternative to nickel-metal batteries for electric vehicles, partially due to its lighter weight and smaller size, and LIB’s have become a common replacement for the lead acid batteries used in golf carts and utility vehicles.
 
Industry Overview
 
The first lithium-ion battery was commercialized by Japan’s Sony in 1991. Since then, the LIB has become the most popular and advanced battery with its reach expanding more and more every day. Lithium-ion batteries are used in and influence nearly every aspect of our lives daily, both at home and at work, and innovation is sprinting forward at a rapid pace. The push for clean and renewable energy, from wind power to solar power, is a driving force in business today and a major reason why Lithium-batteries are and have been a major contender in storing renewable energy.
 
The global market for lithium-ion batteries has grown significantly and is expected to continue to grow as the need for high power and high capacity battery cells increase its penetration into broader forms of use. The power density, safety, recharge time, cost, and other aspects of its technology are expected to continue to improve with future developments in technology.

According to a report published by Allied Market Research titled, "Lithium-Ion Battery Market" the global lithium-ion battery market is expected to generate revenue of $46.21 billion by 2022, with a CAGR of 10.8% during the forecast period (2016-2022).1 As reported by Allied, the market for these batteries is expected to experience significant growth because of their increasing application in the automotive sector. Other key factors that may affect the growth of this market are the growing demand for smartphones, tablets, and other electronic devices; stringent government regulations aimed at reducing the increasing pollution levels; and enhanced efficiency of lithium-ion batteries.
 
Currently, the electronics industry has the highest demand for lithium-ion batteries, however, the automotive sector is forecast to have the highest rising demand for LIB for use in electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The number of electric/hybrid vehicles is expected to increase at an exponential rate in the coming years, which would further increase the demand for lithium ion batteries. For instance, in 2014, Tesla announced its plans to manufacture around 500,000 electric cars every year by around 2018, which would require a huge supply of lithium ion batteries.
 
The Asia-Pacific geographical region is currently the largest in LIB use and production due to burgeoning demand in China, Japan and India. North America and Europe are the second and third leading regions respectively, for lithium-ion battery market.2 Currently, the global market is highly concentrated as about 5 to 6 major players occupy around 50% market share in the overall lithium-ion battery market.3

The following figure shows the market size of lithium based batteries for the 2008-2013 period and expected market size for 2014-2020 forecast.
