 Scott’s Liquid Gold® Wood Care has been our core product since our inception. It has been sold in the United States for over 70 years. Unlike leading furniture polishes, our higher quality product contains natural oils that penetrate the wood’s surface to clean, replace lost moisture, minimize the appearance of scratches and bring out the natural beauty of wood. Our Scott’s Liquid Gold® Floor Restore product is a quick and easy way to renew and protect hardwood floors.
 On October 1, 2019, we acquired Kids N Pets® brands, which includes Messy Pet®. Founded in 1989, Kids N Pets® brands are award winning, safe, stain and odor removing products targeted toward households with children and pets. These high-quality, high-

value brands currently encompass six SKUs exceptional at controlling odor and cleaning up kid and pet accidents, and food and drink stains while being products that parents can feel safe using around their children and pets. Kids N Pets®’ primary sales channel is through retail stores such as Walmart and Home Depot, and online through properties such as such as Amazon and Chewy.
 On July 1, 2020, we acquired Biz® and Dryel® brands. Biz is the top performing laundry additive in the market, utilizing a proprietary enzyme-based formula to fight stains and eliminate odors. It was established by Proctor & Gamble in 1968 and is sold in Powder, Liquid, and Liquid Booster Pack for a total of seven SKUs.
 Dryel is the market leader in the at-home dry cleaning category, representing approximately 65% of the at-home dry cleaning market in 2019.  It was established by Proctor & Gamble in 1998 and is sold primarily in a consumer starter kit with refills.
 Personal Care Products 
 The principal products in our personal care products segment include:
  
• | Alpha® Skin Care products;
--+---------------------------


• | Prell® hair care products;
--+---------------------------


• | Denorex® hair care products; and
--+---------------------------------


• | Batiste Dry Shampoo.
--+---------------------

 Our Alpha® Skin Care brand was one of the first to use alpha hydroxy acids (“AHAs”) in lines of facial care products, body lotion, and body wash. Products containing AHAs gently slough off dead skin cells to promote a healthier, more youthful appearance and help to diminish fine lines and wrinkles.
 In 2016, we acquired the Prell®, Denorex® and Zincon® brands of hair and scalp care products. Prell® Shampoo, an iconic brand since 1947, is a classic clean shampoo for healthy hair. Our Denorex® products are dermatologist-recommended medicated hair care products to control the symptoms of dandruff and other scalp conditions. Our Zincon® product is a medicated anti-dandruff shampoo.
 We have been a distributor in the United States for Batiste Dry Shampoo since 2009. Under our distribution agreement with the manufacturer of Batiste Dry Shampoo, Church & Dwight Co. Inc. (“Church & Dwight”), we are the exclusive specialty retail distributor in the United States of Batiste Dry Shampoo.  The specialty retailer channel includes primarily beauty supply stores, such as Ulta Beauty, Inc. (“Ulta”), our second largest customer, apparel retailers, and department stores. Dry shampoo is a quick and convenient way to refresh hair between washes.
 Marketing and Distribution 
 We primarily market our products through: (1) trade promotions to support price features, displays, slotting fees and other merchandising of our products by our retail customers; (2) consumer marketing in print, social and digital media and television advertising; and (3) to a lesser extent, consumer incentives such as coupons and rebates.
 Our products are sold nationally through our sales force and internationally (Canada and China) through independent distributors, to mass merchandisers, drugstores, supermarkets, hardware stores, e-commerce retailers, and other retail outlets and to wholesale distributors.
 The table set forth below shows net sales to our significant customers as a percentage of consolidated net sales during 2020 and 2019: 
 
 
 | % of Net Sales | 
-------------------------+----------------+---
 | 2020 | | | 2019
Walmart Inc. ("Walmart") | | 29 | % | | 27 | %
Ulta | | 16 | % | | 26 | %

 As is typical in our industry, we do not have long-term contracts with Walmart, Ulta, or any other retail customer.
 We also use our websites for sales of our products directly to consumers. These sales accounted for approximately 2% of total net sales in 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Currently, our international sales are made to distributors who are responsible for the selling and marketing of the products, and we are paid for these products in United States dollars. 
 From time to time, our customers return products to us. For our household products, we permit returns only for a limited time. For our personal care products, returns are accepted for a greater period of time in order to maintain or enhance our relationship with the customer. Typically, customers are granted a credit equal to the original sale price plus a handling charge. 
 Manufacturing and Suppliers 
 On March 10, 2020, we consummated an agreement with Colorado Quality Products LLC (“Elevation”), pursuant to which Elevation (i) acquired certain of our assets, which included all fixed assets utilized in the manufacturing and warehouse operations of the Company, (ii) assumed all of the Company’s obligations under its existing real property leases, (iii) manufactured certain products of the Company for a transitional period, and (iv) paid cash consideration of $500,000 (collectively, the “Elevation Transaction”).
 Subsequent to the Elevation Transaction, we identified third-party logistics and contract manufacturing partners for our product lines. As of December 31, 2020, we no longer manufacture or ship any of our products directly to our retail partners.
 Under our distribution agreement with Church & Dwight, we are the exclusive distributor of Batiste Dry Shampoo products in the specialty retailer channel in the United States. The specialty retailer channel includes primarily beauty supply stores, such as Ulta, apparel retailers and department stores. Church & Dwight retained the rights to sell Batiste products to the remainder of the market in the United States. The distribution agreement with Church & Dwight provides that we will not be permitted to manufacture, distribute or sell any products that are competitive with Batiste Dry Shampoo products. The initial pricing terms for the Batiste products were negotiated with Church & Dwight but may be increased by Church & Dwight at any time upon 90 days’ prior written notice of any price increase. On November 9, 2020, we executed the Fifth Amendment to the Customer Agreement with Church & Dwight, which extends the term of our distribution agreement through December 31, 2021, requires 120 days’ advance notice of non-renewal of future one-year terms, and adjusts the process for selling inventory after expiration or termination of the agreement. We have been a distributor for Church & Dwight since 2009.
 Competition
 Both the household and personal care product categories are highly competitive and innovative. We compete in both categories against a range of competitors, most of which are significantly larger and have greater financial resources, name recognition, innovation capabilities, and product and market diversification than us. We compete in both categories primarily on the basis of quality, brand recognition, and the distinguishing characteristics of our products. The wood care and laundry care product categories are dominated by a small number of companies that are significantly larger than us and each of these competitors produces several competing products. In the personal care category, several of our competitors are also significantly larger than us and each of these competitors produces several competing products.
Regulation
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that pertain to the types of consumer products that we manufacture and sell. Many chemicals used in consumer products, some of which are used in several of our product formulations, have come under scrutiny by various state governments and the Federal government. These chemicals are called volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”). All of our products currently meet the most stringent VOC regulations and may be sold throughout the United States. Many of our skin care products, several of which contain AHAs, are considered cosmetics within the definition of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FFDCA”). Our cosmetic products are subject to the regulations under the FFDCA and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. The relevant laws and regulations are enforced by the FDA. We believe that we are producing and marketing all of our products in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the markets in which we participate.
 Prior to the Elevation Transaction, our production facility was subject to Federal, state, and local regulations governing water quality, air quality, and waste related to stationary sources and we held required permits from the state of Colorado, which implements the delegated Federal programs. These programs regulate the emissions, discharges, and waste generated in the production of our products.
 The laws and regulations applicable to our production facility will no longer impact us following the consummation of the Elevation Transaction.
 Our advertising is subject to regulation under the Federal Trade Commission Act and related regulations, which prohibit false and misleading claims in advertising. Private and derivative labeling claims are common in this industry and can result in costly settlements and distraction of management. Changes in these regulations, or interpretations or enforcement of these regulations, could adversely affect our profitability, result in regulatory actions, or private or derivative claims.

Our international sales are primarily conducted in China and we rely on the efforts of our exclusive distributor in the PRC to market and sell our products there. As such, we may be impacted by regulations, economic conditions, and tariffs imposed by the PRC. In 2019, we were impacted by regulatory changes imposed on over-the-counter (“OTC”) products by the PRC’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”).
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2020, we employed 36 people, which work in administrative, sales, advertising, marketing and operational functions. We believe our employees are critical to providing the public with high-quality, high-value products and find it crucial to continue to attract and retain experienced employees. We strive to offer a competitive compensation and benefits program, foster a community where everyone feels included and empowered to do to their best work, and give employees the opportunity to give back to their communities and make a social impact.
 No contracts exist between us and any union. The compensation of our executive officers is subject to annual review by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.
 Patents and Trademarks 
 At present, we own one patent for our Neoteric Diabetic® Healing Cream. Additionally, we actively use our registered trademarks for Scott’s Liquid Gold®, Alpha® Skin Care, Prell®, Denorex®, Zincon®, and Neoteric® in the United States and have registered trademarks in a number of additional countries. Our registered trademarks protect names and logos relating to our products as well as the design of boxes for certain of our products.
