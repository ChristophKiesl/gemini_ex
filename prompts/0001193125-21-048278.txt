Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview 
 


We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT with in-house capabilities including acquisition, credit research, asset management, portfolio management, real estate research, legal, finance and accounting functions. We primarily invest in single-tenant, operationally essential real estate assets throughout the United States, which are subsequently leased on a long-term, triple-net basis to high quality tenants with operations in retail, industrial, office and certain other industries. 
 As of December 31, 2020, Spirit owned a diversified portfolio of 1,860 properties with gross investment in real estate totaling approximately $6.8 billion and with in-place Annualized Base Rent of $509.6 million. See Item 2. “Properties - Our Real Estate Investment Portfolio” for further information on our portfolio diversification. 
 Our operations are carried out through the Operating Partnership. OP Holdings, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner and owns approximately 1% of the Operating Partnership. We and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are the only limited partners and together own the remaining 99% of the Operating Partnership. 
 Shares of our common stock are traded on the NYSE under the symbol “SRC.” 
 Business and Growth Strategies 
 


Our objective is to maximize stockholder value by providing a growing stream of earnings and dividends generated by high quality, diversified commercial real estate. We seek to accomplish this objective by utilizing our proprietary tools and underwriting expertise to invest in and manage a high-quality portfolio of single tenant, operationally essential real estate throughout the United States, which generally consists of free-standing, commercial real estate facilities where our tenants conduct activities essential to the generation of their sales and profits. We then generate revenue

primarily by leasing these properties to tenants we believe possess attractive credit characteristics and operate in stable or growing industries. Our leases are typically structured as triple-net leases, whereby the tenant is responsible for all improvements and is contractually obligated to pay all property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, insurance premiums and repair and maintenance costs. 
 

STRONG OPERATING SYSTEMS
------------------------


Spirit utilizes integrated tools that streamline key processes for acquisitions, tenant monitoring and managing our capital structure, forecasts and records. We believe the effective use of our technology platforms to inform portfolio management decisions provides efficiency, depth and scalability to our processes, allowing us to seamlessly execute our objectives. To enhance our operating systems, we have developed several proprietary tools to minimize risk and maximize returns for our stockholders: 
 

o | Spirit Property Ranking Model. The Spirit Property Ranking Model is a core tool developed internally by Spirit that ranks every owned and acquired property across twelve criteria, with a higher weighting allocated to real estate characteristics. The criteria are: (i) replacement rent, assuming the property becomes vacant, (ii) real estate score based on the site’s location, access, visibility and overall desirability, (iii) 5-mile population, (iv) remaining lease term, (v) 5-mile house-hold income, (vi) pre-overhead unit coverage, (vii) pre-overhead master lease coverage, (viii) corporate coverage, (ix) U.S. State ranking, (x) rent escalation characteristics, (xi) lease structure and (xii) tenant industry ranking. We believe that the higher the overall score assigned to a property, the lower the risk of a residual loss given a tenant default. Through acquisitions, dispositions, lease renewals and re-lets, we seek to continually improve the weighted-average property ranking of our portfolio.

o | The Spirit Heat Map. The Spirit Heat Map is used to analyze tenant industries across Porter’s Five Forces and for potential causes of technological disruption. The data is then used to predict the long-term future performance of those industries. The Spirit Heat Map is updated regularly to incorporate changes in business and market conditions, changes in technology and other trends. Using this tool, coupled with our intensive credit and real estate analysis, lease structuring and ongoing portfolio management, we seek to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns by focusing our investments within industries that we believe will be healthy and viable prospectively and disposing of properties within industries that have less favorable outlooks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Spirit Business Intelligence Tools. Our business intelligence tools capture and bring together critical information across Spirit’s databases, including Spirit Property Ranking Model data, industry data and tenant credit data, allowing the information to be efficiently analyzed. Spirit uses these tools to compare potential acquisitions and dispositions to the existing portfolio and quantify improvements in key metrics including industry concentration, tenant concentration, weighted-average lease term, weighted-average Spirit property ranking and credit metrics.

OUTSTANDING PEOPLE
------------------


We have implemented sound social, human capital management and environmental practices and policies throughout the operation of our business, demonstrating our solid commitment to be responsible and conscientious in everything that we do as we strive to both drive long-term stakeholder value and make the communities in which we operate a better place to live and work. We have documented these commitments in our Social Responsibility and Environmental Sustainability Policy and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, each of which can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.spiritrealty.com. One of these key pillars is human capital management. We believe attracting, developing and retaining a team of highly talented and motivated employees is critical to reflecting our “all one team” motto and delivering strong financial results: 
 

o | Talent acquisition and development. To ensure we retain top talent, we provide competitive compensation and benefits, including stock awards for all employees. We aim to develop our employees by providing internal training, leadership coaching programs and providing tuition assistance and course reimbursement for career-enhancing education and licensure requirements. We encourage both formal and informal mentorship to provide employees with critical developmental feedback and all employees have direct access to the executive team, including through monthly “Town Hall” meetings hosted by our CEO. Goals are set annually for each employee and performance is measured at least twice a year on these goals, as well as on each of our core competencies: managing resources, leadership, communication, accountability and teamwork. We look first to promote from within, but when external hires are needed to fill open positions, we use a thorough hiring

process which includes multiple levels of interviews, cultural surveys, and technical skill testing, when appropriate, to ensure candidates will be an appropriate fit.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Diversity and inclusion. We provide equal employment opportunities to all individuals and seek to cultivate an inclusive culture that respects and appreciates diversity of experience, ideas and opinions. Our employee population is very diverse: approximately half of our employees are female, 27% are from racial or ethnic minority groups, and we have well-rounded age diversity. To promote inclusivity, our Diversity and Inclusion Committee is tasked with providing educational and social programming for all affinity groups, as well as directing support to charitable organizations in line with our diversity efforts. Under the Diversity and Inclusion Committee, we have a Women’s Leadership Council, which focuses specifically on empowering the women of Spirit in personal and professional growth. With the support of our Board of Directors, we continue to explore additional diversity and inclusion initiatives.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Employee wellness. The physical and mental well-being of our employees is an important piece of our business and overall success. We have implemented numerous wellness initiatives, including wellness screenings and guided meditation sessions. Our offices were designed with employee health and well-being in mind (sit-stand desks, ergonomic chairs, healthy snack options, maximized natural light in all workspaces, designated creative and collaborative workspaces). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took a number of actions to ensure the health and safety of our employees, including enabling all employees to work from home, enhancing safety measures in our offices for voluntary return to office (including increasing cleaning and sanitizing procedures, temperature screening upon entering the office, providing personal protective equipment, installing plexiglass wellness screens and initiating social distancing measures), and instituted a special COVID-19 pandemic leave policy for illness or caretaking.

o | Workplace culture. We actively seek to create a best-in-class workplace culture through corporate culture workshops and conducting employee surveys. Results of the surveys are communicated to all employees, as well as to our Board of Directors, to provide transparency and continuous improvement. We also seek to acknowledge employee successes through recognition at monthly “Town Hall” meetings. We firmly believe that regular social and team building events for our employees encourage socialization, collaboration, and relationship building – all things that are vital for employee engagement and result in a high performing “all one team” culture. We promote social engagement through our Spirit One Committee (comprised of employees across all levels and departments who collaborate to create social programming), annual company-wide events (including a virtual holiday season party in 2020), and department team building events throughout the year.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


As of December 31, 2020, we had 82 employees, as compared to 85 employees as of December 31, 2019. None of these employees are represented by a labor union. 
 

DEFINED AND DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT STRATEGY
-------------------------------------------


During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased 146 properties, representing an aggregate gross investment of $868.2 million, and invested $10.0 million in revenue producing capital expenditures to fund improvements on properties we already owned. During the same period, we sold 38 properties with an undepreciated gross investment of $86.0 million. We selectively make acquisitions and dispositions that we believe will contribute to our business objectives. We believe there will be ample acquisition opportunities in the single-tenant market fitting our underwriting and acquisition criteria. 
 

o | Sourcing acquisitions. We believe a multi-channel approach drives acquisition volume and are focused on building and growing partnerships with a diverse base of tenants and brokers. Over time, our target is a balanced mix of opportunities sourced from direct relationships with existing tenants, direct relationships with new tenants and broker relationships. These channels are built through current relationships with key members of our acquisitions and asset management teams, partner appreciation events, attendance at critical conferences and conventions and reliable execution.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Evaluating acquisitions. Each acquisition opportunity is evaluated against our acquisition criteria, which includes, but is not limited to: accretive capitalization rate, long-term lease structure containing rent escalations, favorable tenant industries based on the Spirit Heat Map, favorable Spirit property ranking, attractive tenant credit characteristics and overall portfolio diversification impact. As part of our acquisition strategy, we target tenants that are publicly listed, as we believe those tenants possess certain attractive characteristics, including continual access to capital, generally lower leverage, audited financial statements and governance scrutiny.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



9 


While we consider the foregoing when making investments, we have made investments that do not meet one or more of these criteria, and we may make additional investments that do not meet one or more of these criteria if we believe the opportunity is sufficiently attractive. Acquisition opportunities go through a rigorous evaluation process culminating in review and approval by our Investment Committee. The Investment Committee includes representation from the acquisitions, asset management, credit, legal and finance departments.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Evaluating tenant credit. We believe extensive credit underwriting is important to minimizing tenant financial risk and protecting stockholder value. Our credit department, which is independent from our acquisitions department, underwrites all acquisition, disposition and capital investment opportunities and monitors the financial health of our existing portfolio. We use our underwriting capabilities to identify tenants with attractive credit characteristics and stable operating histories and to dispose of tenants with weakening characteristics.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


HIGH-QUALITY PORTFOLIO
----------------------


We believe that portfolio diversification and leases with structures aligned with our business and growth strategies are the cornerstones to managing the inherent risk associated with investing in real estate. The following portfolio qualities help maintain the stability of our rental revenue and maximize our long-term return on our investments: 
 

o | Diverse and granular portfolio. We seek to maintain a portfolio that (i) derives no more than 5.0% of its ABR from any single tenant, (ii) derives no more than 2.0% of its ABR from any single property, (iii) is leased to tenants operating in various industries aligned with our Spirit Heat Map and (iv) is located across the U.S. without significant geographic concentration. As of December 31, 2020, our largest single tenant exposure equaled 3.0%, our largest single property exposure equaled 1.4%, our largest industry concentration equaled 7.7%, and our largest geographic concentration by state equaled 11.1%, in each case based on ABR. Our portfolio is also well diversified between investment and non-investment grade rated tenants with 51.0% of our ABR from public issuers. See Item 2. “Properties - Our Real Estate Investment Portfolio” for further information on our portfolio composition as of December 31, 2020.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Leases for operationally essential real estate. We seek to own properties that are operationally essential to our tenants, thereby reducing the risk that the tenant would choose not to renew an expiring lease or reject a lease in bankruptcy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Leases with contractual rental growth. We seek leases that contain contractual provisions to increase rental revenue over the term of the lease. Approximately 89.8% of our ABR as of December 31, 2020 is subject to rent escalations which, generally, increase rent at specified dates by: (i) a fixed amount; or (ii) the lesser of (a) 1 to 2 times any increase in the CPI over a specified period, (b) a fixed percentage, or (c) a fixed schedule.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Leases with relatively long terms. We seek leases with relatively long terms, typically with non-cancellable initial terms of 10 to 20 years and tenant renewal options for additional terms with attractive rent escalation provisions. As of December 31, 2020, our weighted average remaining lease term based on ABR was 10.1 years.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Leases with a master lease structure. Where appropriate, we seek master leases whereby we lease multiple properties to a single tenant on an “all or none” basis. In a master lease structure, a tenant is responsible for a single lease payment relating to the entire portfolio of leased properties, as opposed to separate lease payments relating to each individually leased property. The master lease structure hinders a tenant’s ability to “cherry pick” locations, where it unilaterally gives up underperforming properties while maintaining its leasehold interest in well-performing properties. Approximately 42.0% of our ABR as of December 31, 2020 is subject to a master lease structure.

Since our inception, our occupancy has never fallen below 96.1%, despite the economic downturns of 2008 through 2010 and the COVID-19 pandemic. While the onset in the U.S. of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in requests for relief from a number of our tenants, the majority of these requests came in the form of rent deferrals, and we believe the diversity and strength of our portfolio helped to limit the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our 2020 operating results. Our discussions with tenants requesting relief substantially focused on industries that have been directly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions intended to prevent its spread, particularly movie theaters, casual dining restaurants, entertainment, health and fitness, and hotels. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we deferred $31.9 million of rent and abated $6.3 million of rent. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we expect to 
 
10 

 see significant reductions in the impact of COVID-19 and have currently granted additional rent deferrals of $9.2 million and abatements of $1.0 million. The deferral periods range, generally, from one to six months, with an average deferral period of four months and an average repayment period of 12 months. The majority of the relief granted to tenants in 2021 relates to tenants in the movie theater industry. Although we are and will continue to be actively engaged in rent collection efforts related to uncollected rent, as well as working with certain tenants who may request future rent relief, we can provide no assurance that such efforts will be successful, particularly in the event that the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions intended to prevent its spread continue for a prolonged period. 
 

FORTRESS BALANCE SHEET
----------------------


Our long-term financing strategy is to maintain a leverage profile that creates operational flexibility and generates superior risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. We finance our operations and investments using a variety of methods, including available unrestricted cash balances, property operating revenue, proceeds from property dispositions, available borrowings under our credit facilities, common and preferred stock issuances, and debt securities issuances, including mortgage indebtedness and senior unsecured debt. We determine the amount of equity and debt financing to be used when acquiring an asset by evaluating our cost of equity capital, terms available in the credit markets (such as interest rate, repayment provisions and maturity) and our assessment of the particular asset’s risk. 
 In October 2020, we renewed our shelf registration statement with the SEC, which became immediately effective upon filing and will expire in October 2023, unless renewed before. Under this shelf registration statement, we may offer shares of our common or preferred stock or debt securities in amounts, at prices, and on terms to be announced when, and if, such shares are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds from any such offerings, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of such offerings. 
 

o | Issuance of common stock. We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows the offering proceeds to be accretively invested into additional properties, to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facilities, or to repay outstanding debt at or before maturity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Issuance of debt securities. We have issued senior unsecured debt securities and have obtained other senior unsecured debt at the Operating Partnership level. In addition, our debt historically has also consisted of some long-term borrowings secured by specific real estate assets or, more typically, pools of real estate assets. To the extent practicable, we expect to maintain a well-balanced debt profile with manageable and staggered maturities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Cash provided by operations. In addition to cash provided by the issuance of common stock and debt securities, we expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs, and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our available credit facilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We anticipate that we will continue to use a number of different sources to finance our acquisitions and operations going forward; however, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital and credit markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us. 
 Competition 
 We face competition for acquisitions from investors, including traded and non-traded public REITs, private equity funds and institutional investment funds, some of which have greater financial resources than we do, a greater ability to borrow funds to acquire properties and the ability to accept more risk than we can prudently manage. This competition may increase the demand for the types of properties in which we typically invest and, therefore, reduce the number of suitable acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the prices paid for such. This competition will increase if investments in real estate become more attractive relative to other forms of investment. 
 As a landlord, we compete in the multi-billion dollar commercial real estate market with numerous developers and owners of properties, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. In operating and managing our portfolio, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors, including 
 
11 

location, rental rates and flexibility. Some of our competitors have greater economies of scale, have lower cost of capital, have access to more resources, and have greater name recognition than we do. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose our tenants or prospective tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates or to offer substantial rent abatements, tenant improvement allowances, early termination rights or below-market renewal options in order to retain tenants when our leases expire. 
 Regulation 
 GENERAL 
 Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals. 
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT 
 Pursuant to the ADA, our properties are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA, as well as a number of additional federal, state and local laws and regulations, may require modifications to properties we currently own and any properties we purchase, or may restrict renovations of those properties. Noncompliance with these laws or regulations could result in fines or an award of damages to private litigants, as well as the incurrence of costs to make modifications to attain compliance. Although our tenants are generally responsible for compliance with the ADA and other similar laws or regulations, we could be held liable as the owner of the property for a failure of one of our tenants to comply with such laws or regulations. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regulate releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. Some of our properties contain, have contained, or are adjacent to or near properties that contain or have contained storage tanks for petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Similarly, some of our properties are or were used for commercial or industrial purposes that involve or involved the use of hazardous or toxic substances or are adjacent to or near properties that are of have been used for such purposes. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant may be required to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases or threats of releases, and may be held liable to a government entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred by those parties in connection with actual or threatened contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to fault, or whether or not the owner, operator or tenant knew of or caused the contamination. The liability may be joint and several for the full amount of the investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken, although a party held jointly and severally liable may seek contributions from other identified, solvent, responsible parties for their fair share toward these costs. In addition, strict environmental laws regulate a variety of activities that can occur on a property, including the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, air emissions and water discharges. Such laws may impose fines or penalties for violations. 
 Environmental laws also govern ACM. Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management to identify and warn, through signs and labels, of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to ACM in their building. The regulations also have employee training, record keeping and due diligence requirements pertaining to ACM. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations and we could be subject to lawsuits if personal injury from exposure to ACM occurs. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of ACM when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release into the environment of ACM and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with ACM. 
 In addition, our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or other airborne contaminants. The presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly 
 
12 

remediation to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. Further, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. 
 Before completing an acquisition, we obtain environmental assessments carried out in accordance with the Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments as set by ASTM International. These assessments generally include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant federal, state and local environmental and health agency database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the property’s chain of title and review of historical aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property. These assessments are limited in scope, however, if recommended in the initial assessments, we may undertake additional assessments such as soil and/or groundwater samplings, other limited subsurface investigations and ACM or mold surveys. A prior owner or operator of a property or historic operations at our properties may have created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the site assessments. Generally, our leases provide that the lessee will indemnify us for any loss or expense we incur as a result of the presence, use or release of hazardous materials on our property. However, if environmental concerns are not satisfactorily resolved in any initial or additional assessments, we may obtain environment insurance policies to insure against potential environmental risk or loss depending on the type of property, the availability and cost of the insurance and various other factors we deem relevant (i.e., an environmental occurrence affects one of our properties where our lessee may not have the financial capability to honor its indemnification obligations to us).
