Item 1. Business
Background
 
Global WholeHealth Partners Corporation was incorporated on March 7, 2013 in the State of Nevada under the name Texas Jack Oil and Gas Corp. On May 9, 2019, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to effect a change of name to Global WholeHealth Partners Corporation to align the company name with its focus on health care related development and products. The Company’s ticker symbol changed to GWHP.
 
The Company was originally organized for the purpose of exploration of Oil and Gas. However, the Company was unable to establish an oil and gas concern and was abandoned in 2016. On February 27, 2019, the Clark County District Court of Nevada appointed Barbara Bauman as custodian to the Company. The custodian reestablished the Company in good standing.
 
On May 9, 2019, the Board reverse split (1-for-500) the outstanding Common Shares of 58,172,000 to 116,358 shares.
 
May 23, 2019, the Company and LionsGate Funding Group LLC (“LionsGate”), owner of a majority of the Company’s outstanding common stock as of May 23, 2019, entered into a Stock Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) which closed on June 27, 2019. Pursuant the SPA, the Company issued 56,000,000 shares of common stock to LionsGate in exchange for 100% of their interests in Global WholeHealth Partners Corp., a private Wyoming corporation incorporated on April 9, 2019 (“Global Private”). Global Private has contacts with suppliers and contract manufacturers in the In vitro diagnostic industry, with rights to sell rapid diagnostic tests, such as the following 6 minute rapid whole blood Ebola Test, 6 minute whole blood Zika test, 8 minute whole blood rapid TB test and 75 plus other tests more than 40 which are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved. Due to the common control of the Company and Global Private, pursuant to ASC 805-50-25, “Transactions Between Entities Under Common Control”, the SPA was accounted for as a transfer of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities under the predecessor value method of accounting. Financial statement presentation under the predecessor values method of accounting as a result of a business combination between entities under common control requires the receiving entity (i.e., the Company) to report the results of operations as if both entities had been combined as of the beginning of the periods presented. The consolidated financial statements include both entities’ full results since the inception of Global Private.

Industry Overview
 
Our Business
 
The Company was founded to develop, manufacture and market in-vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) tests for over-the-counter (“OTC” or consumer), or consumer-use and point-of-care (“POC” or professional) which includes hospitals, physicians’ offices and medical clinics, including those within penal systems throughout the US and abroad. The Company currently manufactures and markets a range of diagnostic test kits for consumer use through OTC sales, and for use by health care professionals, generally located at medical clinics, physician offices and hospitals known POC, in the United States. These test kits are known as in-vitro diagnostic test kits or IVD products.
 
The Company believes, according to publicly available sources, that the IVD industry is a multi-billion dollar industry that is increasing each year. This assessment includes all laboratory hospital-based products, OTC devices, and rapid tests performed at the point-of-care. The Company believes that the following factors can be attributed to the increase in overall need and use of IVD test kits: an aging baby-boomer population; increasing healthcare costs; the ever-growing number of uninsured and under-insured in the U.S. and abroad; and a general increase in consumer awareness, in part due to the wealth of information available on the Internet.
 
The concepts that distinguish POC technology—operation simple enough for non-laboratory users; little or no maintenance requirement; and rapid, reliable results—mean that it can be applied equally well in many non-clinical settings, such as the OTC market. As advances in medical technology increasingly make it possible to diagnose diseases and physiological conditions from ever-smaller amounts of body fluids, certain diseases and conditions that once required diagnosis by physicians and/or medical technicians inside hospital emergency rooms, exam rooms/bedside studies, or private clinics, can now also be done by inexpensive, easy-to-use diagnostic devices that consumers can use in the comfort and anonymity of their home. Today, the average pharmacy, whether a privately owned neighborhood store, or chain owned, has become an outlet for selling IVD test kits for in-home use.
    All of the products we sell are manufactured in an FDA Approved Facility in the USA. An FDA Approved facility is a facility that meets Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) with the FDA.
 
The products that are not FDA approved to sell in the US are for export only and cannot be sold in the US. We are not presently looking to file for FDA 510K for the non-FDA.

The Following Tests are FDA Approved for POC (Point Of Care) Professional Approval from FDA.
 
We list 9 tests as follows:
 
There several different types of combination of testing that can be done with the Urinalysis Reagent Strips.  Urinalysis is a test of your urine. A urinalysis is used to detect and manage a wide range of disorders, such as urinary tract infections, kidney disease and diabetes. A urinalysis involves checking the appearance, concentration and content of urine. Mayo Clinic Oct 23, 2019.
 
Urinalysis tests include the following: 1.Glucose: This test is based on a double sequential enzyme reaction. One enzyme, glucose oxidase, catalyzes the formation of gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide from the oxidation of glucose. A second enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with potassium iodide chromogen to oxidize the chromogen to colors ranging from blue-green to greenish-brown through brown and dark brown. 2.Bilirubin: This test is based on the coupling of bilirubin with a diazotized dichloroaniline in a strongly acid medium. The colors range from light tan to reddish-brown. 3.Ketone: This test is based on the reaction of acetoacetic acid with sodium nitroprusside in a strongly basic medium. The colors range from beige or buff-pink color for a “Negative” reading to pink and pink-purple for a “Positive” reading. 4.Specific Gravity: This test is based on the apparent pKa change of certain pretreated polyelectrolytes in relation to the ionic concentration. In the presence of an indicator, the colors range from dark blue or blue-green in urine of low ionic concentration to green and yellow-green in urine of higher ionic concentration. 5.Blood: This test is based on the pseudo peroxidase action of hemoglobin and erythrocytes which catalyzes the reaction of 3,3’,5, 5’-tetramethyl-benzidine and buffered organic peroxide. The resulting colors range from orange to yellow-green and dark green. Very high blood concentration may cause the color development to continue to dark blue.6. pH: This test is based on the well known double pH indicator method, where bromothymol blue and methyl red give distinguishable colors over the pH range of 5-9. The colors range from red-orange to yellow and yellow-green to blue-green.7. Protein: This test is based on the protein error-of-indicator principle. At a constant pH, the development of any green color is due to the presence of protein. Colors range from yellow for a “Negative” reaction to yellow-green and green to blue-green for a “Positive” reaction. 8.Urobilinogen: This test is based on a modified Ehrlich reaction in which p-diethylamino benzaldehyde reacts with urobilinogen in a strongly acid medium. Colors range from light pink to bright magenta. 9.Nitrite: This test depends on the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of Gram-negative bacteria in the urine. The nitrite reacts with p-arsanilic acid to form a diazonium compound in an acid medium. The diazonium compound in turn couples with 1,2,3,4- tetrahydro benzo(h) quinoline to produce a pink color.10. Leukocytes: This test is based on the action of esterase present in leukocytes, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of an indoxyl ester derivative. The indoxyl ester liberated reacts with a diazonium salt to produce a beige-pink to purple color. 11.Ascorbic Acid: This test is based on the action of a complex chelating agent with a polyvalent metal ion in its higher state and an indicator dye that can react with the metal ion.

CoVid-19 / SARS2 Activities
 
In response to the CoVid-19 / SARS2 (“CoVid-19”) Pandemic, in early January 2020, the Company set out to test and perform the studies necessary to develop a Rapid Diagnostic Test (“RDT”) and Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“RT-PCR”). During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company completed the testing necessary to develop both the RDT and RT-PCR tests. RDT test results are available in 10 minutes with an overall accuracy rate of 98%. The RT-PCR test looks for the E-Gene and RdRq-Gene markers and has proven to be 97% accurate. The test is able to be processed in any PCR machine and each test kit includes the required reagents.
 
On March 15, 2020, the Registrant received an Acknowledgment Letter from the FDA that the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the U.S Food and Drug Administration has received the Registrant’s Emergency Use Approval for the Real Time PCR Test. The Registrant’s submission has been assigned the unique document control number PEUA200084.
 
On April 6, 2020, Company received an Acknowledgment Letter (the “Letter”) from the FDA that the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the FDA has received the Company’s Rapid Diagnostic IgG/IgM 10 minute Rapid test application submitted by Charles Strongo, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. The Rapid Diagnostic IgG/IgM 10 minute Rapid test requires no machine. The Company’s submission has been assigned the unique document control number EUA200181.
 
On May 22, 2020, Company received a Letter of Authorization from 1drop Inc. which authorizes the Company to sell 1drop Inc.’s 1copy TM COVID-19 qPCR Multi Kit, which has received Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration.
 
Industry
 
The use of diagnostics in quality measures often is supported by clinical practice guidelines. Of all quality measures in HEDIS (The Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (“HEDIS”) is a widely used set of performance measures in the managed care industry, developed and maintained by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (“NCQA”) and NQMC (The National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (“NQMC”), we identified guidelines specifically recommending diagnostic use in the NGC for 61.5% of those in HEDIS and 78.5% of those in the NQMC.
 
Of course, the development of measures for HEDIS, NQMC and other quality assessment initiatives is a relatively new process and represents only a sample of evidence-based use of diagnostics. Nevertheless, this analysis conveys the essential role of diagnostics in health care quality. Further, the incorporation of diagnostics into quality measures serves as a benchmark for assessing underuse of diagnostics and the health and economic impact of such underuse.
 
In its annual report on the state of health care quality in the US, NCQA assessed the impact of under-compliance with HEDIS measures, including those pertaining to diagnostics, on avoidable adverse health events, deaths and costs. Figure 7.7 below shows the impact for measures pertaining to diagnostics used in breast cancer detection, cholesterol management, colorectal cancer screening and diabetes management.

 549 State of health care quality: industry trends and analysis. Washington, DC: National Committee for Quality Trance, 2004.
 
These and other findings of the 2004 NCQA report on the state of health care quality demonstrate the potential for evidence-based use of diagnostics to improve health care quality and to avoid unnecessary adverse health events, deaths and costs. These studies are the most recent and as time has passed, we all understand that the cost of Health Care has gone up dramatically and therefore the savings to the health care industry is even greater than the studies show (See Figure 7.7 above).
 
Health care increasingly is subject to demands for improved health and quality of life and constraints on the spending required to deliver these improvements. In vitro diagnostics, henceforth in this report referred to as diagnostics, aid in responding to such demands by enabling accurate detection of health risks and disease at earlier stages and improving treatment and disease management, while diminishing subsequent health problems and their associated costs. Diagnostics serve a key role in the health value chain by influencing the quality of patient care, health outcomes, and downstream resource requirements.
 
From consumer-friendly at-home pregnancy and glucose monitoring tests to more complex automated laboratory-based systems, these tests are often first-line health decision tools. While diagnostics comprise less than 5% of hospital costs and about 1.6% of all Medicare costs, their findings influence as much as 60-70% of health care decision-making. The value of diagnostics accrues to not only clinicians and patients, but to health care managers, third-party payers, and quality assurance organizations that use diagnostic performance to measure and improve health care quality.
 
The following data have been culled from various publicly available sources that the Company believes to be accurate but cannot guarantee it. The Company has attempted to provide conservative statistics and believe that it is generally known that the market for IVD products is significant and is continuing to grow.
 
The pregnancy test is one of the primary home tests used in the world. The Company believes that approximately, 85,000 retail drug stores in the U.S. are selling over $900 million of pregnancy tests alone and continues to increase annually. Presently, it knows of five major manufacturers of this product.
 
The ovulation test market is generally estimated at $51 million annually and is growing annually. Presently, the Company is aware of four major brand companies that offer this test.

The glucose (diabetes) whole blood test is used to test for abnormal glucose blood levels. A significant number of individuals are affected in the United States with non-insulin dependent diabetes (Type II), many of whom are without knowledge of the disease. This disease, left untreated, can cause cardiovascular disorders and cataracts. With the explosive growth of childhood obesity and general poorer health on Americans, this test can saves thousands of lives.
 
As mentioned in the table 7.7: Diabetes management: There are 14,000 heart attacks, strokes, or amputations; 4,300–9,600 Deaths, but with Rapid Diagnostic Testing an annual avoidable cost of $573 million per year, and lives saved.
 
The Company’s most recent OTC product is its colorectal test (colon disorders). The Company estimates the demand for this test to increase with awareness of availability. It knows of only one other company that is currently offering this product. The colorectal Cancer screening tests helps detect the possibility of cancer early and can saves thousands of lives and millions of dollars. Colorectal cancer screening (FOBT) Fecal Occult Blood Test: 20,000 cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed/treated at a later stage and 4,200–6,300 deaths, but with Rapid Diagnostic Testing an annual avoidable cost of $191 million per year and lives saved.
 
The Company’s cholesterol OTC test and its cholesterol colorimetric POC test are available to test for abnormal levels of cholesterol in whole blood. There is evidence that a high blood cholesterol level increases the risk of developing arteriosclerosis, and with it the risk of coronary heart disease or stroke. This heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, as reported by the American Heart Association. Estimated Annual Avoidable Adverse Health Events are estimated to be approximately 14,600 with estimated annual avoidable deaths of approximately 6,900–17,000 from high Cholesterol. Rapid Diagnostic Tests taken by these populations would save an estimated $87 million per year and lives saved.
 
The market for drugs-of-abuse tests for the over-the-counter market is generally estimated to be one of the fastest growing markets of all IVD test products. At present, the Company believes that many law enforcement and governmental agencies are using laboratory testing facilities and must wait for results, often taking one week to ten days. The Company’s tests are completed onsite within ten minutes.
 
A significant number of people are infected by the H-Pylori bacteria, which are associated with ulcers. The Company’s H-Pylori test for the POC is one of its newest products.
 
All of the Company’s diagnostic tests, over 90 products are available for international distribution. The Company believes that its tests are excellent for distribution and use in underdeveloped countries because, unlike lab and other rapid diagnostic tests, its test kits do not need refrigeration and can withstand extended periods of excessive heat.
 
Competition
 
Several companies around the world carry similar products, typically comprised of approximately 10-30 different products. However, we carry the largest line of products that we know of including over 100 products. As of December 31, 2019, Global WholeHealth Partners Corp. has made no sales.
Marketing and Sales
 
The company plans on selling through large and small distributors, giving the company the greatest opportunity to sell to a greater amount of people, doctors, hospitals, clinics and governments.
Research and Development:
 
We are continuing to look for needs in the world to create and work with our scientific team and science partners to make a rapid test for the newest diseases, such as ZIKA, EBOLA, TB, and Malaria.
