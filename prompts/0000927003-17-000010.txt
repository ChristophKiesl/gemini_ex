We also supply power control modules for controlling thermal processes, and thermal instrumentation products for advanced temperature measurement, both of which provide solutions for semiconductor, thin film industrial, and heavy industry. Our remote plasma sources are used in the thin films processing industries and in gas abatement applications. Our high voltage products offer unique power solutions for semiconductor, analytical instrumentation, industrial x-ray, and medical imaging applications. Our network of global service support centers provides revenue as we offer repair services, conversions, upgrades, and refurbishments to companies using our products.
In 2014, in connection with broadening our product offerings, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of HiTek Power Group ("HiTek") and UltraVolt, Inc. ("UltraVolt"), which offer a comprehensive portfolio of high voltage and custom built power conversion products. These products target applications including semiconductor wafer processing and metrology, scientific instrumentation, mass spectrometry, industrial printing and analytical x-ray systems for industrial and analytical applications, as well as high voltage power supplies and modules ranging from benchtop and rack mount systems to microsize printed circuit board mount modules.
In 2014 we also acquired the intellectual property from AEG Power Solutions' Power Control Modules ("PCM") which is comprised of the Thyro-Family of products and accessories and has applications in different industries ranging from materials' thermal processing through chemical processing, glass manufacturing and numerous other general industrial power applications.
We incorporated in Colorado in 1981 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1995. Our executive offices are located at 1625 Sharp Point Drive, Fort Collins, Colorado 80525, and our telephone number is 970-407-4670.
Products and Services
Our products are designed to enable new process technologies, improve productivity, and lower the cost of ownership for our customers. We also provide repair and maintenance services for all of our products.
In 2014, we changed our organizational structure from two business units (formerly known as the Thin Films Business Unit and the Solar Energy Business Unit) to a single functional organization with various product lines organized as reportable segments, Precision Power and Inverters. As of December 31, 2015, we discontinued our Inverter production, engineering, and sales product line representing a strategic shift in our business. As such, all Inverter revenues, costs, assets and liabilities are reported in Discontinued Operations for all periods presented herein and we currently report as a single unit.
We principally serve OEMs and end customers in the semiconductor, flat panel display, high voltage, solar panel, and other industrial capital equipment markets. Our products are used in diverse markets, applications, and processes including the manufacture of capital equipment for semiconductor devices, thin film applications for thin film renewables and architectural glass, and for other thin film applications including flat panel displays, and industrial coatings. These markets can be cyclical in nature. Therefore, demand for our products and our financial results can change as demand for manufacturing equipment and repair and maintenance services change in response to consumer demand. Other factors, such as global economic and market conditions and technological advances in fabrication processes and renewable applications can also have an impact on our financial results, both positively and negatively.

Our process power systems include direct current ("DC"), pulsed DC, low frequency, high voltage, and radio frequency ("RF") power supplies, matching networks, remote plasma sources for reactive gas applications and RF instrumentation. These power conversion systems refine, modify, and control the raw electrical power from a utility and convert it into power that may be customized and is predictable and repeatable.
Our power control modules and thermal instrumentation products are used in the semiconductor industry, including adjacent thin film applications for solar PV and light emitting diode ("LED") industries, and heavy industries, for thermal control and temperature measurement solutions for applications in which time-temperature cycles affect material properties, productivity, and yield. These products are used in rapid thermal processing, chemical vapor deposition, crystal growing, and other semiconductor and solar applications requiring non-contact temperature measurement. They are also used in chemical processing, glass manufacturing and numerous other general industrial power applications.
Our high voltage products are designed to meet the demanding requirements of original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") worldwide. Our high voltage power solutions and custom built power conversion products offer high frequency, high voltage topology, providing wide input and output operating ranges while retaining excellent stability and efficiencies ranging from benchtop and rackmount systems to microsize printed circuit board mount modules. The products target applications including semiconductor wafer processing and metrology, scientific instrumentation, mass spectrometry, industrial printing and analytical x-ray systems for industrial and analytical applications.
Our global support services group offers in-warranty and out-of-warranty repair services in the regions in which we operate, providing us with preventive maintenance opportunities. Our customers continue to pursue low cost of ownership of their capital equipment and are increasingly sensitive to the significant costs of system downtime. They expect that suppliers offer comprehensive local repair service and customer support. To meet these market requirements, we maintain a worldwide support organization comprising of both direct and indirect activities through partnership with local distributors primarily in the United States ("U.S."), the People’s Republic of China ("PRC"), Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Germany, and Great Britain.
Effective with the conclusion of our inverter wind-down on December 31, 2015, we consider all inverter new product warranties historically sold to be discontinued operations. However, extended warranties historically sold and reflected as “Deferred Revenue” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent future revenue and service costs to be incurred by our global services group and are reflected as continuing operations for historical periods and future periods. See Note 3. Discontinued Operations in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Markets
Our products compete in markets for high tech manufacturing capital equipment and renewable energy production. Our markets are not generally subject to seasonality; however, these markets are cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand for customers’ products, inventory levels relative to demand, government incentives and subsidies, and access to affordable capital. For more information related to the markets in which we compete and the current environment in those markets, see Business Environment and Trends in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
SEMICONDUCTOR CAPITAL EQUIPMENT
Customers in the semiconductor capital equipment market incorporate our products into equipment that make integrated circuits. Our power conversion systems provide the energy to enable thin film processes, such as deposition and etch, and high voltage applications such as ion implant, wafer inspection and metrology.

Customers
Our products are sold worldwide to approximately 200 OEMs and integrators and directly to more than 1,500 end users. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 67.7% of our sales in 2016, 61.2% of our sales in 2015, and 59.7% of our sales in 2014. We expect that the sale of products to our largest customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our sales for the foreseeable future.
Applied Materials Inc., our largest customer, accounted for 35.2% of our sales in 2016, 29.8% of our sales in 2015, and 29.8% of our sales in 2014. Lam Research accounted for 20.7% of our sales in 2016, 20.3% of our sales in 2015, and 19.9% of our sales in 2014. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of our sales in 2016, 2015, or 2014. The loss of Applied Materials, Inc. or Lam Research as a customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Backlog
Our backlog was approximately $69.2 million at December 31, 2016, a 58.4% increase from $43.7 million at December 31, 2015. This increase resulted primarily from the rebound of the semiconductor capital equipment market after the pause in investment in the fourth quarter of 2015, coupled with the strong growth we have seen throughout 2016. For more information related to our expectations for the markets we serve, see Business Environment and Trends in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Backlog orders are firm orders scheduled to be filled and shipped in the next 12 months and include our just-in-time supply agreements with major OEM’s.
Backlog orders are not necessarily an indicator of future sales levels because of variations in lead times and customer production demand pull systems. Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Delays in delivery schedules and/or customer changes to backlog orders during any particular period could cause a decrease in sales and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
We sell our products through direct and indirect sales channels in North America, Europe, and Asia. Our sales operations are primarily located in the United States, the PRC, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, South Korea, India, Singapore, and Taiwan. In addition to a direct sales force, we have independent sales representatives and distributors that support our selling efforts. We maintain customer service offices at many of the locations listed above, as well as other sites near our customers' locations. We believe that customer service and technical support are important competitive factors and are essential to building and maintaining close, long-term relationships with our customers.

See Item 1A "Risk Factors" for a discussion of certain risks related to our foreign operations.
Manufacturing
The manufacturing of our Precision Power related products is performed in Shenzhen, PRC; Ronkonkoma, New York; and Littlehampton, United Kingdom. Manufacturing in these three locations, primarily the PRC, exposes us to risks, such as exchange controls and currency restrictions, changes in local economic conditions, changes in PRC laws and regulations, government actions, inability to meet customer demands if one of our facilities becomes impaired, and unsettled political conditions. The thermal instrumentation product line is manufactured in Vancouver, Washington. 
Manufacturing requires raw materials, including a wide variety of mechanical and electrical components, to be manufactured to our specifications. We use numerous companies, including contract manufacturers, to supply parts for the manufacture and support of our products. Although we make reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers, some key parts may be obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We seek to reduce costs and to lower the risks of production and service interruptions, as well as shortages of key parts by:

• | selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for key parts using rigorous technical and commercial evaluation of suppliers' products and business processes including testing their components' performance, quality, and reliability on our power conversion product at our customers' and their customer's processes. The qualification process for Precision Power, particularly as it pertains to semiconductor customers, follows semiconductor industry standard practices, such as “copy exact”;


• | monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers;


• | maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts, including making last time purchases of key parts when notified by suppliers that they are ending the supply of those parts;


• | qualifying new parts on a timely basis and in geographies that reduce costs without degradation in quality;


• | locating certain manufacturing operations in areas that are closer to suppliers and customers; and


• | competitively sourcing parts through electronic bidding tools to ensure the lowest total cost is achieved for the parts needed in our products.

Intellectual Property
We seek patent protection for inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research and development. We currently hold 107 United States patents and 78 foreign-issued patents, and have 80 patent applications pending in the United States, Europe and Asia. A substantial majority of our patents relate to our Precision Power business. Generally, our efforts to obtain international patents have been concentrated in the industrialized countries within Europe and 
 6

Asia because there are other manufacturers and developers of power conversion and control systems in those countries, as well as customers for those systems for which our intellectual property applies.
Litigation may, from time to time, be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how owned by us, to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others, or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. See "We are highly dependent on our intellectual property" in Item 1A "Risk Factors."
Competition
The markets we serve are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological development and changing customer requirements. No single company dominates any of our markets. Significant competitive factors in our markets include product performance, compatibility with adjacent products, price, quality, reliability, and level of customer service and support.
We have seen an increase in global competition in the markets in which we compete, especially from Asian and European-based component suppliers. We encounter substantial competition from foreign and domestic companies for each of our product lines. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. In some cases, competitors are smaller than we are, but are well established in specific product niches. MKS Instruments, Inc., COMET Holding AG., Daihen Corp., TRUMPF Hüttinger GmbH + Co. KG., Comdel, Inc., Kyosan Electric Mfg. Co., Ltd., New Power Plasma co., Ltd., EN Technologies Inc., and Adtec Plasma Tech. Co., Ltd. compete with our power conversion products for thin film processing. Spellman High Voltage Electronics Corp., Crane Co., and Matsusada Precision, Inc. offer products that compete with our high voltage products. LumaSense Technologies, Inc., CI Systems Ltd., BASF SE., and LayTec AG. offer products that compete with our thermal instrumentation products. Eurotherm, Control Concepts Inc., CD Automation, and Spang Power Electronics offer products that compete with our power control modules.
Additionally, a focus on local content is causing new competitors to emerge around the world, with strong support from local governments, industry leaders, and investors.
Our ability to continue to compete successfully in these markets depends on our ability to make timely introductions of product enhancements and new products, to localize these development and production activities in key world regions, and to produce quality products. We expect our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their products, and introduce new products with competitive performance characteristics. We believe that we compete effectively with respect to these factors, although we cannot assure that we will be able to compete effectively in the future.
Research and Development
The market for our precision power conversion, thermal, and high voltage products is characterized by ongoing technological changes. We believe that continued and timely development of new highly differentiated products and enhancements to existing products to support end user and OEM requirements is necessary for us to maintain a competitive position in the markets we serve. Accordingly, we continue to devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development projects and seek to maintain close relationships with our key customers and other industry leaders in order to remain responsive to their product requirements now and in the future.
Research and development expenses were $44.4 million in 2016, $39.6 million in 2015, and $36.9 million in 2014, representing 9.2% of our sales in 2016, 9.5% of our sales in 2015, and 10.0% of our sales in 2014.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 1,558 employees. Our employees are not represented by unions, except for statutory organization rights applicable to our employees in the PRC. We believe that our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Effect of Environmental Laws
We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as the environmental laws and regulations of the foreign federal and local jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing and service facilities. We believe we are in material compliance with all such laws and regulations.
Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, an adverse effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition, or results of operations.
