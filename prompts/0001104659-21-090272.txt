--------+---------

General
 
Universal Security Instruments, Inc. (“we” or “the Company”) designs and markets a variety of popularly-priced safety products consisting primarily of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms and related products. Most of our products require minimal installation and are designed for easy installation by the consumer without professional assistance, and are sold through retail stores. We also market products to the electrical distribution trade through our wholly-owned subsidiary, USI Electric, Inc. (“USI Electric”). The electrical distribution trade includes electrical and lighting distributors as well as manufactured housing companies. Products sold by USI Electric usually require professional installation.
 
In 1989 we formed Eyston Company Limited (Eyston), a limited liability company under the laws of Hong Kong, as a 50% joint venture partner with a Hong Kong-based partner, to manufacture various products in the Peoples Republic of China (the “Hong Kong Joint Venture”). Effective, March 31, 2020 we sold our 50% interest in Eyston, however Eyston continues to be the Company’s principal supplier of safety alarms.  The Company imports almost all of its other products from foreign suppliers.
 
In light of the shutdowns, quarantines and other restrictions and delays in operations and travel caused by or related to COVID-19 in the PRC and the United States, the Company has experienced delays in shipping and receiving of products. As the Company’s products are sold primarily to the construction industry and do-it-yourself centers, restrictions and limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have had an impact on the Company’s sales We are not yet able to quantify the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our sales and financial results, but we believe that during the first half of calendar 2020 (our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and first quarter of fiscal 2021) sales were negatively impacted by lower sales resulting from steps taken to combat the spread of COVID-19. Sales in our second and third fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2020 increased significantly when compared to sales for the comparable 2019 periods due to the Company’s ability to fill orders from inventory for a large national retailer new customer, when the national retailer’s usual supplier was unable to fill the orders due to delays caused by the pandemic. Our sales growth was also due to sales of two products to another large national retailer which purchased certain of our models as a 1,350 store test, which were completed in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021.
 
Our sales for the year ended March 31, 2021 were $17,520,151 compared to $14,803,024 for the year ended March 31, 2020. We reported net earnings of $268,343 in fiscal 2021 compared to a net loss of $5,813,891 in fiscal 2020, an increase in net earnings of $6,082,234 (104.6%). The net earnings for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 are attributed to increased sales and gross margins, and to the forgiveness of debt associated with the Paycheck Protection Program loan under the Cares Act. The net loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 is primarily due to the loss arising from the sale of the Company’s interest in the Hong Kong Joint Venture, the Company’s interest in the loss from investment in the Hong Kong joint venture’s operations, and operating losses from the Company’s domestic operations.
 
The Company was incorporated in Maryland in 1969. Our principal executive office is located at 11407 Cronhill Drive, Suite A, Owings Mills, Maryland 21117, and our telephone number is 410-363-3000. Information about us may be obtained from our website www.universalsecurity.com.

Safety Products
 
We market a line of residential smoke and carbon monoxide alarms under the trade names “UNIVERSAL” and “USI Electric” both of which are manufactured by Eyston.
 
Our line of safety alarms consists of units powered by replaceable batteries, ten year sealed batteries, or are 120 volt with battery backup. Our replaceable battery products contain different types of batteries with different battery lives, and some include alarm silencers. The smoke alarms marketed to the electrical distribution trade also include hearing impaired and heat alarms with a variety of features. We also market door chimes, ventilation products, ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCI’s), and other electrical devices.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, USI Electric, Inc., focuses its sales and marketing efforts to maximize safety product sales, especially smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms manufactured by Eyston, to the electrical distribution trade.
 
Import Matters
 
We import all of our products. As an importer, we are subject to numerous tariffs which vary depending on types of products and country of origin, changes in economic and political conditions in the country of manufacture, potential trade restrictions, and currency fluctuations. Substantially all of our safety products are imported from the People’s Republic of China. These products are currently subject to tariffs ranging from ten to twenty-five percent.
 
We have attempted to protect ourselves from fluctuations in currency exchange rates to the extent possible by negotiating commitments in U.S. dollars. Our inventory purchases are also subject to delays in delivery due to problems with shipping and docking facilities, as well as other problems associated with purchasing products abroad.
 
As previously discussed, in light of the shutdowns, quarantines and other restrictions and delays in operations and travel caused by or related to COVID-19 in Hong Kong, the PRC and the United States, the Company has experienced delays in shipping and receiving of products.
 
Sales and Marketing; Customers
 
We sell our products to various customers, and our total sales market can be divided generally into two categories; sales by the Company to retailers, including wholesale distributors, chain, discount, television retailers and home center stores, catalog and mail order companies and other distributors (“retailers”), and sales by our USI Electric subsidiary to the electrical distribution trade (primarily electrical and lighting distributors and manufactured housing companies) and foreign customers. Products marketed by the Company have historically been retailed to “do-it-yourself” consumers by these retailers. Products marketed by our USI Electric subsidiary to the electrical distribution trade typically require professional installation. We do not currently market a significant portion of our products directly to end users.
 
A significant portion of our sales are made by approximately 40 independent sales organizations, compensated by commission, which represents approximately 100 sales representatives, some of which have warehouses where USI Electric products are maintained for sale. In addition, the Company has established a national distribution system with eight regional stocking warehouses throughout the United States which generally enables customers to receive their orders the next day without paying for overnight freight charges. Our agreements with these sales organizations are generally cancelable by either party upon 30 days’ notice. We do not believe that the loss of any one of these organizations would have a material adverse effect upon our business. Sales are also made directly by the officers and full-time employees of the Company and our USI Electric subsidiary, seven of whom have other responsibilities for the Company. Sales outside the United States are made by our officers and through exporters, and amounted to less than five percent of total net sales in fiscal years 2021 and 2020.
 
We also market our products through our website and through our own sales catalogs and brochures, which are mailed directly to trade customers. Our customers, in turn, may advertise our products in their own catalogs and brochures and in their ads in newspapers and other media. We also exhibit and sell our products at various trade shows, including the annual National Hardware Show.

Our backlog of orders as of March 31, 2021 was approximately $3,905,000. Our backlog as of March 31, 2020 was approximately $507,000. The increase in backlog is primarily due to delays in unloading of freight at California ports of entry caused by or related to COVID-19 issues.
 
Hong Kong Joint Venture
 
Through March 31, 2020 we held a fifty percent interest in Eyston Company Limited, the Hong Kong Joint Venture, which has manufacturing facilities in the People’s Republic of China, for the manufacturing of certain of our electronic and electrical products. Effective, March 31, 2020 we sold our fifty percent interest in the Hong Kong Joint Venture in exchange for $4,000,000. The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce our trade accounts payable due to the Hong Kong Joint Venture by $4,000,000. In addition, the Company and the HKJV agreed to convert $1,081,440 of trade accounts payable to an interest only note payable requiring monthly interest only payments. In April, 2020 the Company and the HKJV formalized these terms into a note payable agreement with a maturity date of April 19, 2022. Subsequent to March 31, 2020 Eyston will continue to be the Company’s principal supplier of safety alarms and the Company will pay for these purchases upon evidence of shipment from the factory. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, 77.6% and 82.7% of our total inventory purchases were made from Eyston, respectively.
Other Suppliers
 
Certain private label products are manufactured for us by foreign suppliers. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good. The loss of any of our suppliers would have a short-term adverse effect on our operations, but replacement sources for these other suppliers could be developed.
Competition
 
In fiscal years 2021 and 2020, sales of safety products accounted for substantially all of our total sales. In the sale of smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms, we compete in all of our markets with First Alert and Walter Kidde Portable Equipment, Inc. These companies have greater financial resources and financial strength than we have. However, we believe that our safety products compete favorably in the market primarily on the basis of styling, features and pricing.
 
The safety industry in general involves changing technology. The success of our products may depend on our ability to improve and update our products in a timely manner and to adapt to new technological advances.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2021, we had thirteen employees, nine of whom are engaged in administration and sales, and the balance of whom are engaged in product development. Our employees are not unionized, and we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
