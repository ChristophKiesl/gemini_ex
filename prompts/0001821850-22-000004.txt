Item 1. Business
Overview
Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc. (“Sunlight”) is a business-to-business-to-consumer, technology-enabled point-of-sale (“POS”) financing platform that provides residential solar and home improvement contractors the ability to offer seamless POS financing to their customers when purchasing residential solar systems or other home improvements. The resulting loans are funded by Sunlight’s network of capital providers who, by partnering with Sunlight, gain access to a difficult-to-reach loan market, best-in-class consumer credit underwriting, and attractive risk adjusted returns. These loans are facilitated by Sunlight’s proprietary technology platform, Orange® (“Orange®” or the “Platform”), through which Sunlight offers instant credit decisions to homeowners nationwide at the POS on behalf of Sunlight’s various capital providers. Since Sunlight’s founding in 2014 through December 31, 2021, Sunlight has facilitated over $6.1 billion of loans through the Sunlight Platform in partnership with its contractor relationships.
Sunlight’s success is fueled by its strong and intentional culture based on core values such as honesty, fairness, and scrappiness. Sunlight’s culture encourages Sunlight teammates to work collaboratively with Sunlight’s contractor and capital provider partners, and the consumers they serve, to find the right result to business challenges and to deliver white-glove service. Also core to Sunlight’s values is a passion for Sunlight’s business and the societal benefits that the business funds. To date, Sunlight has facilitated loans to more than 164,816 homeowners who, as a result, have had the opportunity to save money on their utility bills and choose renewable energy over carbon-producing traditional sources of power. As of December 31, 2021, residential solar systems and energy-efficient home improvement products, facilitated through Sunlight financings since May 2016, have eliminated an estimated 27.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Sunlight has also executed the United Nations Climate Neutral Now Pledge, and its business was certified as carbon neutral for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 and is in the process of performing the required review to obtain certification for its fiscal year 2021. Sunlight will continue to pursue certification for carbon neutrality in the future.
Sunlight’s core business is facilitating loans made by Sunlight’s various capital providers to the consumer customers of residential solar contractors. Sales of Sunlight-facilitated loan products are made by contractors in the context of selling residential solar systems to consumers, allowing homeowners to go solar with no money down, and in most cases, immediately saving money on their utility bills and often saving a significant amount of money over the life of their solar system. While only approximately 20% of residential solar system sales were financed with solar loans in 2015, an estimated 63% of residential solar loan sales were financed with solar loans in 2020. Solar loans made to finance residential solar systems through Sunlight’s Platform are made exclusively to homeowners. Sunlight believes that homeowners generally have better credit characteristics than other consumer groups. As of December 31, 2021, the average FICO score of all solar borrowers financed through Sunlight’s Platform is 746. Both the generally strong credit profile of solar loan borrowers and attractive risk-adjusted returns on solar loans to capital providers have enabled Sunlight to build a diversified network of capital providers to fund the solar loans facilitated by Sunlight’s Platform.
Loan providers in the residential solar industry compete primarily on process (customer and contractor experience), pricing, and products. Orange® offers contractors robust tools to sell more solar systems and home improvements and homeowners a fast, fully-digital and frictionless experience. Because Sunlight has diverse funding sources, Sunlight is able to offer a large suite of competitive loan products that include multiple loan structures and combinations of interest rates and tenors.
Sunlight’s Technology-Enabled POS Financing Platform and Loan Facilitation
Sunlight’s revenue is primarily from platform fees earned on each solar and home improvement loan facilitated through Orange®. The platform fee is generally equal to the margin between the contractor fee charged to the contractor by Sunlight for each loan facilitated through Orange® and the discount at which Sunlight’s capital provider either funds or purchases such loan (as described in more detail below). The best-in-class credit quality of Sunlight-facilitated loans attracts diverse and attractively-priced capital (the “price” to Sunlight being the amount that a capital provider will pay to originate or purchase a Sunlight-facilitated loan), ensuring that Sunlight can offer competitive pricing to its network of contractors while still earning attractive margins. Sunlight’s business model is asset light and therefore Sunlight has minimal consumer credit risk. Sunlight does not earn material revenue from loans maintained on its balance sheet.
Relationships with Contractors
Sunlight’s expansive network of residential solar system installers and other home improvement contractors, supported by a differentiated set of tools and services offered through Orange®, constitutes the distribution channel through which Sunlight builds funded loan volume and earns platform fees. The ability to finance residential solar systems on terms that 
often create immediate savings for homeowners on their utility bills and typically significant lifetime savings has materially contributed to the strong growth in the number of residential solar systems installed in the United States over the last five years. Sunlight attracts and builds strong relationships with residential solar system contractors of all sizes in key solar markets by prioritizing innovations in Orange® and providing services that assist the contractors in growing their own businesses. Sunlight’s team of business development and relationship management professionals provides hands-on support to these contractors. Sunlight believes that innovations such as prequalification capabilities, easy and secure document upload features, reliable next day funding and Sunlight’s short-term capital advance program (as described more fully below), amongst other innovations, both attract new contractors to Sunlight’s network and build loyalty and deepen Sunlight’s existing contractor relationships. In addition, Sunlight’s diverse set of capital providers enables Sunlight to offer its network of contractors a wide array of loan products that vary as to structure, interest rate and tenor, and thereby permits Sunlight’s network of contractors to offer the products that best serve their markets, and all at competitive pricing. These benefits to Sunlight’s existing network of contractors translate to deeper penetration of the contractors’ sales, which is an important contributor to the growth of Sunlight’s market share and revenue.
Relationships with Capital Providers
Sunlight’s business model is dependent on its ability to connect its capital providers, who wish to build a portfolio of residential solar system or other home improvement loans, to the homeowner customers of the contractors in Sunlight’s distribution network, who wish to finance the purchase of a residential solar system or other home improvements. Sunlight earns a platform fee on each solar and home improvement loan facilitated through Orange®. The platform fee is generally equal to the difference, or the margin, between (i) the dealer fee that Sunlight charges to contractors for access to Orange® and for making the various Sunlight-offered loan products available to such contractors and (ii) the capital provider discount charged by the relevant capital provider either funding or purchasing the loan in the direct and indirect channels, respectively (as described below). Sunlight’s business is therefore heavily dependent upon the availability of capital on attractive economic terms. Sunlight believes that it offers capital providers an attractive value proposition due to its industry-leading consumer credit underwriting, the attractive risk-adjusted returns that Sunlight’s capital providers earn relative to other asset classes, the access that the Platform provides to a unique and growing asset class that may reduce volatility in the ability to deploy capital, and the ability to access new customers for very little cost.
Sunlight categorizes its capital providers as being either in Sunlight’s direct or indirect channel. Sunlight maintains both channels to provide diversification of funding sources, access to funding for different types of loan products and for other strategic purposes. The ability of Sunlight to allocate loans to various capital providers, as well as the availability of the two different funding channels, creates flexibility and allows Sunlight to respond nimbly to shifting market conditions.
Direct channel capital providers fund Sunlight-facilitated solar or home improvement loans one-by-one directly onto their balance sheet via Orange®. Sunlight’s direct channel capital providers are depository institutions with the power and authority to originate loans such as banks and credit unions. Generally, direct channel capital providers choose to service the loans they originate.
In the indirect channel, Sunlight’s allocation engine directs that certain solar and home improvement loans be funded on the balance sheet of Sunlight’s intermediary bank partner. These loans are aggregated, pooled and sold to indirect channel capital providers that cannot, or do not wish to, directly originate solar loans. The indirect channel capital provider relationship allows Sunlight to access a broader range of capital, which may include, among others, credit funds, insurance companies and pension funds. Indirect channel capital providers present a unique opportunity for Sunlight to access high quality and significant sources of funding that are diverse from traditional depository sources.
Sunlight’s Products
Sunlight-Facilitated Solar Loans. Sunlight facilitates a broad range of solar loan products, varying as to structure, tenor and interest rate, which are focused on differing contractor and consumer objectives and market dictates. Sunlight facilitates solar loan products structured to support the financing of residential solar systems as well as to meet other homeowner demands such as loans to:
•    finance the acquisition of a solar battery to be retrofit to an existing homeowner solar system;
•    provide financing for a residential solar system plus a new roof in the same loan as is often required to support the addition of the solar panels;
•    finance solar in addition to other forms of home improvement projects; and
•    finance solar roof products (solar roof tiles).
Sunlight’s solar loan products are secured and fixed rate, closed-end term loans. Specific terms are developed to address homeowner financing needs, amongst other factors as discussed below, and include tenors between 5 and 25 years with interest rates per annum ranging from 0.00% to 8.49%. Not all tenors are offered at each available interest rate and not all solar loan structures are offered at all tenors. For a solar loan, minimum principal amounts are generally $10,000 and maximum principal amounts are $100,000, all subject to qualification requirements. In 2021, Sunlight launched Solar Maxx® and HI Maxx®, a suite of non-prime solar and home improvement products which expand Sunlight’s offerings across the credit spectrum, thereby further improving the value proposition for contractors and allowing greater access to solar and home improvement loans.
Sunlight-Facilitated Home Improvement Loans. Home improvement loans facilitated by Sunlight through Orange® are unsecured, closed-end term loans. The structures applicable to loan products in the home improvement space tend to be more varied. Consumer demand includes payment structures that include delays in the start of payment obligations, periods of interest only payments, periods of principal only payments as well as straight-line amortizing fixed rate loans. Sunlight has developed a full range of loan products including different tenors that range from 2 to 15 years. Home improvement loans are often significantly smaller than solar loans with a minimum loan balance of $500 but can also be as large as $100,000. During the year ended December 31, 2021, interest rates on Sunlight-facilitated home improvement loan products ranged up to 22.50%. Similar to Sunlight-facilitated solar loans, Sunlight-facilitated home improvement loans offered through Orange® are determined by consumer demand, terms requested by Sunlight’s contractors (which may also be driven by the dealer fee charged to a contractor for a given loan product), availability of attractively-priced funding from Sunlight’s capital providers, the attractiveness of a given loan product measured by the production of related loan volume, the interest rate environment and other market factors and the regulatory and risk management concerns of Sunlight and its capital providers amongst other considerations. Sunlight home improvement loan products made up less than 10.0% of Sunlight’s funded loans and less than 6.0% of its revenue in fiscal year 2021.
Seasonality
The residential solar and home improvement markets are subject to seasonality primarily related to weather and other industry factors, which typically causes fluctuations in Sunlight’s operating results and can cause Sunlight’s future performance to be difficult to predict. Sunlight has experienced seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in the past and expects to experience such fluctuations in the future. Sunlight’s contractors generally experience higher sales in the second and third quarters of each year. Given the timeline between a solar system or home improvement sale and when a loan to finance such project is funded, this generally results in higher funded volumes for Sunlight, on a relative basis, in the third and fourth quarters of each year, however, Sunlight believes that the increasing impacts of climate change could make the seasonality in Sunlight’s business less predictable. Sunlight further believes that the seasonality in credit applications and funded volume that it experiences in its business is consistent with others that compete in the same markets.
Competition
Competition for Sunlight occurs at two levels: (i) competition to acquire and maintain contractor relationships; and (ii) competition to acquire high quality capital to fund loans, in each case on economic terms favorable to Sunlight.
Competition to obtain contractor relationships is significant. Contractors generally do not enter exclusive relationships with residential solar loan providers and Sunlight’s agreements with its network of contractors generally do not provide for exclusive relationships. However, Sunlight believes that its large array of loan products and flexibility in offering new and additional products, easy-to-use technology-enabled POS financing platform, which provides instant credit decisions and continuing innovation in Orange® and services that support growth in the businesses of its existing network of contractors, attract new contractors and build contractor loyalty.
In addition, the solar system and home improvement loan markets are relatively fragmented. Facilitating the aggregation of loan volume from these markets is a highly competitive sector of these broader industries. Sunlight faces competition from a diverse landscape of consumer lenders, including traditional banks, credit unions, and specialized solar system lenders and lease providers. Sunlight’s competitors source capital from a mix of alternative sources, including depository capital and/or other alternatives that rely on the capital markets. Sunlight has successfully added capital providers and grown commitments from existing capital providers since inception, and has consistently diversified its capital provider base to ensure that it has sufficient capital to fund the demand for Sunlight-facilitated loans and to offer an evolving competitive mix of loan products to meet contractor and consumer demand.
Intellectual Property
Sunlight seeks to protect its intellectual property by relying on a combination of federal, state, and common law rights in the United States, as well as on contractual measures. Sunlight protects its trademarks throughout the United States by making applicable trademark filings and further protects is trademarks and trade secrets via contractual provisions clearly establishing rights of use and Sunlight’s ability to terminate those rights, robust confidentiality provisions and other similar agreements. Sunlight also places appropriate restrictions on its proprietary information to control access and prevent unauthorized disclosures, a key part of its broader risk management strategy.
Sunlight currently maintains 11 trademarks and has five pending applications for registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office including, among others, registration of its name, “Sunlight Financial,” “Orange®,” Sunlight’s logo and other trade names for loan products or innovations developed and offered by Sunlight. In addition, Sunlight has filed two provisional process method patent applications.
Regulation
Sunlight’s operations are subject to regulation and supervision in a number of jurisdictions. The level of regulation and supervision to which Sunlight is subject varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is based on the type of business activity involved. Sunlight, in conjunction with outside advisors and counsel, seeks to manage its business and operations in compliance with such regulation and supervision. The regulatory and legal requirements that apply to Sunlight’s activities are subject to change from time to time and may become more restrictive, which may make compliance with applicable requirements more difficult or expensive or otherwise restrict Sunlight’s ability to conduct its business activities in the manner in which they are now conducted. Changes in applicable regulatory and legal requirements, including changes in their enforcement, could materially and adversely affect Sunlight’s business and its financial condition and results of operations.
Employees and Human Capital Management
Human Capital. At December 31, 2021, Sunlight employed 216 employees, including 214 full-time employees, in its Charlotte, North Carolina and New York, New York offices as compared to 190 employees, including 188 full-time employees, at December 31, 2020.
Sunlight believes its employees are among its most important resources and are critical to its continued success. Sunlight focuses significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support its operations, and Sunlight’s management team routinely reviews employee turnover rates at various levels of the organization. Sunlight pays its employees competitively and offers a broad range of company-paid benefits, which Sunlight believes are competitive with others in our industry.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Sunlight is committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. Sunlight’s management teams and all of its employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical, and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of Sunlight’s employees must adhere to a code of business conduct and ethics that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required annual training on preventing, identifying, reporting, and stopping any type of unlawful discrimination or other unlawful behavior. In addition, Sunlight recently adopted a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy (the “DEI Policy”) that seeks to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in Sunlight’s culture by, among other things, challenging norms and ferreting out any systemic inequities in its policies, procedures, and practices, and commits Sunlight to using quantitative assessments to measure progress, transparency, and practices that attract and retain diverse leadership.
