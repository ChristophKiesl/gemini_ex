Corporate History
 
Formation and Business Development
 
The Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada on December 8, 2009, under the name Pristine Solutions, Inc.
 
On March 7, 2012, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the State of Nevada increasing the shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 650,000,000 common stock; par value $0.0001 and decreasing the shares of Preferred Stock from 100,000,000 to 50,000,000; par value $0.001.
 
On August 23, 2012, the Company changed its fiscal year from December 31 to January 31.
 
During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2012 thorough 2015 the Company acquired various projects and corporate entities across various industry sectors in an effort to commence revenue generating operations.  As a result of the transition in business focus, management teams and controlling shareholders over these fiscal periods, the Company changed its name from Pristine Solutions Inc. to Eaton Scientific Systems Inc. effective November 27, 2012, and subsequently to  Eco Science Solutions, Inc. during February 2014, in order to better reflect its evolving business operations.  The Company effected a 1000-to-1 reverse stock split in February 2014.
 
On December 15, 2015, our current management, Mr. Jeffery Taylor and to Mr. Don Taylor became the controlling shareholders of the Company and continue to control approximately 20% of the issued and outstanding shares.
 
Effective December 17, 2015, Mr. Jeffery Taylor was appointed to serve as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company and Mr. Don Lee Taylor was appointed to serve as Chief Financial Officer of the Company.  Upon this change in control, the direction of business turned to a focus on eco-friendly products and related businesses.  Between 2015 and 2017 the Company worked to develop certain apps known as Herbo and Fitrix for introduction to the marketplace.
 
The Fitrix app is a powerful and flexible companion, which helps users keep track of your day-to-day fitness routines, dietary habits and alternative medicine intake.  Fitrix users can measure and track anything and everything when it comes to their health and wellness. One can track the accomplishment of custom created goals, monitor dietary, exercise and alternative medication schedules, be notified of important milestones, establish timelines to develop effective habits ... all leveraging a unique notebook and calendar. During fiscal 2020, the Company determined to cease support of the Fitrix app in favour of its Herbo app and suite of enterprise software.
 
The Herbo apps include a database of over 14,000 alternative medicine locations and delivery services, doctors who provide evaluations, and local shops that sell relevant product. The Herbo app helps consumers find products and services that support the intake of alternative medicines for a more naturopathic way of living. Expansions to Herbo over the most recent fiscal years include Herbo For Consumers, Herbo for Business and Herbo for Drivers.

During fiscal 2018 ESSI acquired 100% of the shares of capital stock of Ga-Du Corporation (“Ga-Du”), at which time Ga-Du became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Concurrent with the transaction, on June 21, 2017, Mr. John Lewis and Mr. S. Randall Overson joined the Board of directors of ESSI. Ga-Du offers a Financial Services Platform, as well as Inventory Control and Advisory Software Platforms, and Retail Inventory Control, bringing important enterprise technologies in-house and bringing ESSI an opportunity to expand the reach of its Herbo branding. Subsequently Ga-Du Corporation entered into an Assignment Agreement with G&L Enterprises, wherein G&L Enterprises assigned to Ga-Du Corporation, all of its rights, interest in, and obligations under a License and Master Marketing Agreement (LMMA) it entered into with Alliance Financial Network, Inc. ("AFN").
 
AFN provides financial and enterprise services to businesses and individuals, including the cannabis industry, on a programmatic or membership basis from which AFN derives fees and income from enrolling companies in their financial program and providing a range of services, with respect to which AFN and Ga-Du derive fees and income on a fee based schedule.
 
The primary focus of AFN is a mobile application known as eXPO™ electronic eXchange Portal which provides virtual financial and enterprise services to businesses and individuals that are challenged in the traditional banking systems, and/or require more intensive compliance than banks are willing, or able to perform and/or do not have the technical expertise or financial wherewithal in house to develop their own FinTech solutions, including accounting and enterprise management software.  One such industry is the cannabis industry where AFN establishes Membership relationships with businesses in this industry, following a full compliance audit on the business. These services utilize the Herbo suite of software to effectively track transactional data for eXPO™ users, providing Ga-Du a  share of all Cannabis related revenues received by AFN regardless of the source of revenues through (i) membership fees; (ii) cash depository fees; (iii) merchant processing and credit card fees; (iv) transfer fees; and (v) advertising fees. AFN’s services operate on a national level with sales in both cannabis and non-cannabis based industries.  While revenues allocated to Ga-Du are currently governed on a territory by territory basis, Ga-Du and AFN are actively negotiating an amendment to the agreements to become all inclusive.
  
 In exchange for the revenue split under the LMMA, as amended in March 2018, Ga-Du agreed to pay to AFN $405,000 in three tranches for operational expenses and business development.
 
Under the terms of the aforementioned agreements with respect to a beta trial for the AFN services focused solely on the State of Colorado during the period May through October 31, 2018, $28,431 is payable to Ga-Du from revenue generated by operations on the eXPOTM platform. Subsequently the operations were suspended through August 2019, during which time AFN solidified its’ primary banking relationship and is now able to service and scale as needed with the client’s needs. While AFN re-commenced operating the eXPOTM platform during August 2019, Ga-Du does not yet have any additional revenue allocations.  Presently AFN is growing exclusively on a Member referral basis. We expect revenue from this agreement to resume during fiscal 2021.
 
During February 2019 the Company determined to focus on the growth of its Herbo branding with the development of an easy-to-use enterprise software that allows clients to simplify their processes, remain compliant, and enjoy steady growth.  We engaged a third party to provide development services relative to a suite of software for managing operations including accounting, inventory control and management, data management, reporting and compliance, lead generation and marketing, CRM sales management and certain other key functions.
 
On March 1, 2019 the Company and Haiku Holdings LLC "Haiku", a company controlled by our COO, Mike Rountree, entered into a Trademark Licensing Agreement.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Licensed Marks, including and incorporating Herbo, may be used by Haiku to facilitate the Company's business including lead generation and referral services. Further, as a result of any revenue generating business generated by Haiku, the Company shall receive 90% of the net revenue. The license remains in effect for a period of ten (10) years from the effective date of the agreement and may be terminated on sixty (60) days written notice by the Company should there be a material breach which remains uncured, or at any time on ten (10) days written notice by Haiku without cause.

Effective July 1, 2019, the Company (“Reseller”) entered into a Software Reseller Agreement with respect to the Herbo suite of software offerings with Haiku (“Licensor”). Licensor is the owner of certain computer software-as-a-service offerings and related documentation that it provides to end users. Under the terms of the agreement, the Reseller desires (a) a non-exclusive license of the Software and (b) a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable and limited right and license to reproduce, market, and distribute such Software, and Licensor agrees to grant to Reseller such right and license.  Under the terms of the agreement for each respective End User License Agreement (EULA) entered into with an End User, Reseller shall pay Licensor the corresponding license fee for the software usage of 10% of gross receipts from End Users. Fees are due on or prior to the 15th day of each calendar month in respect of all gross receipts received from End Users during the previous calendar month.
 
During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 the company recorded $5,973 as license fees payable to Haiku under costs of sales as a result of gross revenues generated from software sales of $59,729.
  
Current Business and Strategy
 
 Our business operations commenced generating modest revenues subsequent to our fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 and up to the period ended October 31, 2018, when the initial phase of our eXPOTM beta revenue model testing were complete. Subsequently the operations were suspended through August 2019, during which time AFN solidified its’ primary banking relationship and is now able to service and scale as needed with the client’s needs. While AFN re-commenced operating the eXPOTM platform during August 2019, Ga-Du does not yet have any additional revenue allocations. Presently AFN is growing exclusively on a Member referral basis. We expect revenue from this agreement to resume during fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2020 we took steps to shift our focus to monetizing our Herbo branded apps and recently developed enterprise software to assist companies in the cannabis industry to simplify their processes, remain compliant, and enjoy steady growth.  Under the terms of our licensing agreements with Haiku we commenced generating revenues from licensing of our software during the current fiscal year and continue to seek expansion of this growing area of operation.

 Operations of Ga-Du
 
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Ga-Du, acquired in June 2017, offers the following suite of business functions and opportunities:
 
Financial Services Platform Summary
 
Ga-Du has developed multiple financial services applications.  It has created a software platform that captures individual and business entity data. Ga-Du platform is a secure portal for account access and features incorporating current banking standards for operating and securing online data.

Inventory Control and Advisory Systems Business Summary
 
Retail marijuana is arguably the fastest growing segment of the cannabis industry. National monthly sales numbers seem to demonstrate, average year-over-year increases of over 100% for some years following legalization.  However, cannabis retailers still face hurdles finding working capital due to the federal regulation of cannabis as a Schedule I drug.  This lack of capital results in a potential market disruption opportunity.  Because businesses have not had financial resources to develop their own effective business solutions of various kinds, they represent potential "soft targets" for Ga-Du software and enterprise processes for inventory control and other services.  ESSI, through its acquisition of Ga-Du Corporation, will make available its Ga-Du solutions, advisory services, and inventory control systems (from raw materials to finished product) directly to licensed retail businesses, as well as work-flow analysis and management. Ga-Du has an experienced retail management team which has put in place similar as well as other services systems and processes for inventory acquisition and control.   These systems and processes can be licensed to regulate marijuana retail businesses potentially, allowing the retail business to focus on the customer experience while letting ESSI provide the backend technology and systems. The Ga-Du Management team believes that combining the business customer network of ESSI with the technology and systems that Ga-Du has assembled, in a manner that can allow retail businesses rapid access to cutting-edge technology and retail-marijuana-specific inventory control solutions, may provide ESSI with an edge in the rapidly expanding area of cannabis advisory/business services.
 
Master marketing agreement and AFN
  
Through our executed LMMA between Ga-Du and AFN, Ga-Du has the exclusive right to undertake marketing responsibilities of AFN's eXPOTM platform to businesses globally for CBD, Hemp and Cannabis, provided that such sales do not include Cannabis sales which have not been legalized by that territory’s laws. 
  
AFN is registered with FinCEN (MSB Registration Number: 31000094744769) as a non-financial services institution, compliant with the AML/BSA guidelines of FinCEN, and is regulated by the IRS.  Operating a mobile application known as eXPO™ electronic eXchange Portal, AFN provides financial and marketing services to businesses and individuals, which are challenged in the traditional banking systems, and generally are those that require more intensive compliance then banks are willing, or able to perform.  One such industry is the cannabis industry; however the portal has application to various other industry segments.  AFN is configured to establish Membership relationships with businesses in this industry following a full compliance audit on the business, where applicable, allowing licensed cannabis businesses and other clients an automated tax payment system and Internet banking services including wire transfers, ACH, electronic checks, armored pickup of cash, and bill pay, payroll services, and inventory control "seed to "CPA".  AFN has partnered with our enterprise software suite “Herbo” to augment its services with an enterprise software bundle offering extended services such as business accounting, business insurance, director insurance, employee payroll, inventory system, and credit/debit card management. Additionally, the AFN automated tax payment system can calculate and deliver state tax payments within 48hrs after the funds are made available in a taxpayer's account. The AFN eXPO™ solution is a federally registered solution in the United States which incorporates an in-depth anti-laundering and "Know Your Customer" process, ensuring compliance with the Cole memo and all federal and state regulations. Further bundled into this software solution is the "seed to CPA" accounting system, which provides a frugal and efficient way for businesses to report and manage their finances. In terms of tax collection, account services, and business features, this software is unparalleled at providing fast, compliant, and traceable cash management solutions.
  
Under the agreements, AFN will provide all software platform(s) necessary to deliver the Financial Services, assure compliance with appropriate Federal Requirements and international money laundering restrictions, administer all compliance, enrollment, and collection of fees from the Members contracting with AFN, provide any and all necessary marketing or other materials describing AFN's services and program, will forward any required Sales Commissions to the appropriate recipients, and assure adequate customer service at all times.
 
AFN will be responsible for the functional operation of any software utilized in providing its services and for the administration and handling of monies and/or any credits relating thereto and, in the event of any claim, cause of action or lawsuit (together the "Claims") for failure to properly administer such responsibilities, AFN shall have the sole obligation to defend such Claim(s) and shall fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless Ga-Du from and against such Claims.
 
AFN will maintain accounting and data concerning the income from the Cannabis Industry and will generate a monthly income statement as to each of the following revenue streams: (i) membership fees; (ii) cash depository fees; (iii) merchant processing and credit card fees; (iv) transfer fees; and (v) advertising fees.
 
AFN and Ga-Du split compensation derived from income generated from enrollees of Ga-Du according to a fee schedule established for each level of business relationship. As noted above, while the revenue sharing agreement is currently based on territory, AFN and GA-Du are currently re-negotiating to include all service areas.
 
During fiscal 2019 we completed a beta program restricted to the State of Colorado whereby we generated revenues between May and October 2018 under this business segment and while initial revenue sharing was modest, we expect this segment to become a viable revenue stream in the Company's portfolio during fiscal 2021. Subsequently the operations were suspended through August 2019, during which time AFN solidified its’ primary banking relationship and is now able to service and scale as needed with the client’s needs. While AFN re-commenced operating the eXPOTM platform during August 2019, Ga-Du does not yet have any additional revenue allocations.

Strategy
 
In recent years the Company has changed the focus of its original strategy from App based revenue to revenue generated from several key operational areas.
 
 The Company intends to be a vertically integrated provider of consumer and enterprise technology products and services, which assist consumers, companies, brands and entrepreneurs to effectively transact business, with compliance, in the combined multi-billion-dollar cannabis and CBD hemp industries. 

 
 The Company's consumer initiatives are currently centered on education and connecting consumers with various cannabis and CBD hemp businesses.  Its enterprise initiatives are focused on developing technology and accounting solutions, coupled with data analytics to help businesses to be more effective in their abilities to connect, market, and sell to consumers.

 
 Over the past several years, ESSI has developed technology and service relationships with those in farming, extraction, manufacturing and distribution in both the cannabis and CBD hemp industries.  Along with its subsidiary Ga-Du, ESSI is now able to provide a 360-degree ecosystem for business location, localized communications between consumers and business operators, on-topic social networking, inventory management / selection, payment facilitation and cash management.

Intellectual Property
 
The Company has registered and has in process applications for certain Herbo trademarks.  There is no other intellectual property.
 
Government Regulations
 
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine, even though these persons are in compliance with state law.
 
In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. Although they have not done so, the current administration could decide to strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis. See Justice Department Memo on Marijuana Enforcement discussed below.  Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could impact our planned business operation. Because the business activities of businesses, engaged in the medicinal cannabis industry, that we may direct our customers is illegal under federal law, we may be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities through the location services that we provide to our customers, relative to the cannabis industry.  As a result, we may be subject to actions by law enforcement authorities, which would materially and adversely affect our business.  Legislation is currently pending in the U.S. Congress which would reclassify cannabis from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3. If enacted into law, such change could provide a material benefit to businesses engaged in the cultivation and sale of cannabis, including eligibility for federal tax deductions, access to the banking system and generally de-criminalizing the use or sale of cannabis where it is legal under applicable state laws.
 
The current administration has indicated that it will closely scrutinize the cannabis industry, in particular, recreational marijuana. While we do not directly engage in the sale or cultivation of cannabis, changes in laws, rules and regulations could have a material adverse or positive effect on our business and financial condition.
 
Justice Department Memo on Marijuana Enforcement
 
Because of the inconsistencies in federal and state law, on January 4, 2018, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a memo on federal marijuana enforcement policy announcing what it deemed to be a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous guidance documents which would include the so called Cole Memorandum. Since the passage of the Controlled Substances Act in 1970, Congress has generally prohibited the cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana. In the memorandum, the Attorney General directed all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities. The DOJ asserts this return to the rule of law is also a return of trust and local control to federal prosecutors who know where and how to deploy Justice Department resources most effectively to reduce violent crime, stem the tide of the drug crisis, and dismantle criminal gangs.
 
On April 13, 2018 it was announced that President Donald Trump had promised Senate Republican Cory Gardner that he will support congressional efforts to protect states that have legalized marijuana, defusing a months-long standoff between Sen. Cory Gardner and the administration over Justice Department nominees. Trump told Gardner that despite the DOJ memo of January 4, 2018, the marijuana industry in Colorado will not be targeted. A bill has not been finalized, but discussion has commenced to find legislation that would, in effect, make clear the federal government cannot interfere with states that have voted to legalize marijuana.(1)

Industrial Hemp
 
Industrial hemp is now legal in the U.S., which advocates hope could eventually loosen laws around the popular marijuana extract CBD.
 
The 2018 farm bill which legalized hemp including a variety of cannabis that does not produce the psychoactive component of marijuana, paved the way to legitimacy for an agricultural sector that has been operating on the fringe of the law. Industrial hemp has made investors and executives swoon because of the potential multibillion-dollar market for cannabidiol, or CBD, a non-psychoactive compound that has started to turn up in beverages, health products and pet snacks, among other products.
 
Currently, it appears that CBD will remain largely off-limits for ingestible products. The Food and Drug Administration issued a statement saying that despite the new status of hemp, CBD is still considered a drug ingredient and remains illegal to add to food or health products without the agency’s approval, disappointing many hemp advocates, who said they will continue to work to convince the FDA to loosen its CBD rules. The FDA said some hemp ingredients, such as hulled hemp seeds, hemp seed protein and hemp seed oil, are safe in food and won’t require additional approvals.
 
The farm bill places industrial hemp, which is defined as a cannabis plant with under 0.3% of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, under the supervision of the Agriculture Department and removes CBD from the purview of the Controlled Substances Act, which covers marijuana. The law also “explicitly” preserved the Food and Drug Administration’s authority to regulate products containing cannabis, or cannabis-derived compounds.
