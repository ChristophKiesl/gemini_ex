ITEM 1. BUSINESS
​
Our business
​
Founded in 1989, we are a global merchant acquirer and payment processor servicing more than 700,000 merchants and processing approximately 4.9 billion transactions annually. We help enable electronic commerce globally with local operations in 13 countries and the ability to serve over 50 markets around the world. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors through (1) a highly productive and scaled sales distribution network, including exclusive global financial institution and tech-enabled referral partnerships, (2) our three proprietary, in-house processing platforms that are connected by a single point of integration, and (3) a comprehensive suite of payment and commerce solutions, including integrated software, at the physical point-of-sale (“POS”), eCommerce, and business-to-business (“B2B”) solutions. We believe these points of differentiation allow us to deliver strong organic growth, increase market share, and attract additional relationships with financial institutions, technology companies, and other strategic partners.
We are focused on delivering products and services that provide the most value and convenience to our merchants and their customers. Our payment and commerce solutions consist of our core proprietary products and services, value-added solutions, as well as services that we enable through technical integrations with third-party providers. Our global footprint and ease of integration attract new partner relationships, allowing us to develop a robust integrated solutions partner network and positioning us to stay ahead of major trends in each of our markets.
We operate three proprietary, in-house processing platforms, all connected via our EVO Snap solution and each supporting a different geographic region. EVO Snap provides a technical connection to our regional processing systems and a central point of integration for all third-party product partners. Importantly, our platforms allow us to address the unique needs of specific payments markets and to control the entire customer experience. In-house processing also allows us to directly address merchant and regulatory concerns regarding the flow of cardholder data and other sensitive information. Our proprietary systems provide scale efficiencies which minimize our variable costs as merchant counts and transaction volumes increase.
Due to our broad distribution, diversified product offering, leading tech-enabled solutions, and client service, we are able to build strong relationships with our merchants and referral partners. These merchants rely on our product offerings, including our payment processing, on-boarding, underwriting, technical support, secure infrastructure, and settlement services, and our technology is often heavily embedded in our merchants’ infrastructure.
As an intermediary between merchants and card networks, we collect a series of fees primarily driven by the number, type, and value of transactions processed. These merchant service fees are then split into three components: (1) fees remitted to the financial institution that issued the card (interchange), (2) fees remitted to the card networks, and (3) fees retained by EVO. The allocation of these three components vary greatly based on a number of factors, including merchant size, merchant industry, merchant location, type of card, and type of transaction (e.g., card present and card-not-present). In addition, we generate fees for products and services provided to capture transactions, value-added services and more advanced technology solutions that we provide to our merchants.
On August 1, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Global Payments Inc. (“Global Payments”) and Falcon Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Payments (“Merger Sub”). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Global Payments has agreed to acquire EVO, Inc. in an all-cash transaction for $34.00 per share of Class A common stock. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into EVO, Inc. (the “Merger”) with EVO, Inc. surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Payments. Upon the consummation of the Merger, EVO, Inc. will cease to be a publicly traded company.
We have agreed to various customary covenants and agreements, including, among others, agreements to conduct our business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Merger. We do not believe these restrictions will prevent us from meeting our debt service obligations, ongoing

costs of operations, working capital needs, or capital expenditure requirements. The Merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.
Our segments
We classify our business into two segments: the Americas and Europe. The alignment of our segments is designed to establish lines of business that support the various geographical markets we operate in and allow us to further globalize our solutions while working seamlessly with our teams across these markets. In both of our segments, we provide our customers with merchant acquiring solutions, including integrated solutions for retail transactions at the physical and virtual POS, as well as B2B transactions. These also represent the operating segments used by our Chief Executive Officer for evaluating our performance and allocating resources. Refer to Note 20, “Segment Information,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial data pertaining to our segments. 
We believe the changing trends in payment technologies, including the increased adoption of tech-enabled payment solutions and the ongoing cash-to-card conversion, will continue to support growth across our segments. 
Americas
Our Americas segment includes our operations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Chile. In the United States and Canada, where card penetration rates are among the highest in the world, we are focused on driving growth from the changing trends in payment technologies, including the increased adoption of software at the POS for retail and B2B transactions. In Latin America, overall card penetration is significantly lower than that of the United States and Canada. When coupled with other attributes, including a bank-centric acquiring model, terminal-centric small and medium sized enterprises (“SMEs”) markets, and centralized in-country processing shared among competitors, we see highly attractive and sustainable growth opportunities.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we processed approximately 1.1 billion transactions in the Americas, and segment revenue represented 59.1% of total revenue. 
Europe
Our Europe segment includes our operations in Poland, Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain, and the Czech Republic, as well as our support of merchants in surrounding markets. The European merchant acquiring market has certain structural characteristics such as accelerating cash-to-card conversion, including regulatory support for digital payment acceptance, increased tech-enabled payments adoption, bank-centric acquiring models, significant penetration of local debit networks, and terminal-centric SME markets, which we believe provide us with future opportunities for growth. 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we processed approximately 3.8 billion transactions in Europe, and segment revenue represented 40.9% of total revenue.
Seasonality
We typically experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenue, which can vary by region. Historically, in both the Americas and Europe, our revenue has been strongest in the fourth quarter and weakest in the first quarter as many of our merchants experience a seasonal lift during the traditional vacation and holiday months. 
Our sales and distribution network
Within each segment, we have developed a diverse network of sales distribution channels to drive growth for our merchant portfolio. Leveraging our global direct sales force, we target merchants across a wide variety of countries, industries, and sizes. Strategic investments in new products and distribution channels and the seamless introduction of these capabilities to our global markets are central components of our growth strategy. These sales distribution networks consist of our Tech-enabled division, which includes our independent software vendor (“ISV”), B2B, and eCommerce businesses, as well as our Direct and Traditional divisions.

Tech-enabled
Our Tech-enabled division represents our relationships with merchants requiring a technical integration at the POS between us and a third party software solution whereby the third party passes information to our systems to enable payment processing. These merchant acquiring arrangements are supported by our direct sales force as well as partnerships with ISVs, integrated software dealers or resellers, and eCommerce gateway providers. In the United States, our Tech-enabled division also includes our B2B business, through which we provide integrated solutions to enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) software to enable companies utilizing this software to accept digital payment methods from their business customers. Our B2B relationships are supported by our proprietary solutions sold directly to merchants and via ERP software dealers or resellers. We have emerged as a preferred partner for these third-party referral partners because of the ease of integration through our proprietary solutions, high merchant satisfaction levels driven by the quality of our service, and the ease and speed of our boarding systems for new merchants.
Our network of over 1,500 integrated partnerships allows us to target a range of merchants, including SMEs and larger merchants such as corporations and multi-national customers, who desire an integrated software solution for their physical locations, an eCommerce gateway solution for their virtual storefronts, and sophisticated integrations to ERP systems to enable digital payment acceptance for B2B transactions. Our proprietary eCommerce capabilities and eCommerce referral partners, as well as our differentiated B2B product offerings including payment integrations to top-tier and industry-specific ERP systems, enable us to target larger merchants across our domestic and international markets. 
ISV. Our integrated payments solutions are embedded into business management software solutions owned or licensed by our tech-enabled partners, which span numerous industry verticals and geographic markets. We grow our ISV business by enabling digital payments acceptance through business management software solutions for new and existing merchants, leveraging our tech-enabled referral network, and our direct sales force. We have invested and continue to invest in infrastructure that allows software providers, including dealers and resellers, to offer our proprietary integrated payment solutions to merchants across all of our markets. These investments include enhancing our current infrastructure as well as strategic acquisitions of integrated technology solutions. Our EVO Snap platform’s simple yet powerful connection point provides software developers and their partners access to our three processing platforms—thereby allowing merchants to accept various payment methods across all of our geographic markets.
In July 2021, we acquired Anderson Zaks Limited, an omni-channel payment gateway provider in the United Kingdom to expand our tech-enabled capabilities and broaden our ISV network in the U.K. and across Europe for merchants in key retail verticals, including hospitality, pharmacy, venues, ticketing, and general retail, among others.
B2B. We offer B2B solutions, which combine our payment processing capabilities and business automation software through our market-leading PayFabric gateway to simplify digital payments acceptance for our merchants’ business-to-business transactions. We believe that merchants of all sizes are increasingly looking to improve their back office operations by leveraging digital automation and workflow technology. In addition to our processing capabilities, we offer various interchange management solutions, reporting solutions and other business automation tools to merchants, particularly larger companies with complex payment needs. As a result of our strategic acquisitions and internal development, we are able to offer our solutions to Microsoft, Oracle, Sage, Acumatica, and SAP merchants leveraging our certified native integrations, as well as merchants utilizing various industry-specific business management solutions through our custom integrations. Our investments in the development of our B2B PayFabric gateway have also enabled us to offer these merchants proprietary payment solutions for retail eCommerce transactions.
In May 2022, we acquired North49 Business Solutions, Inc., a certified Sage development partner based in Canada, to provide enhanced B2B integrated payment solutions for Sage customers.
eCommerce. Our eCommerce solutions enable our merchants to securely and seamlessly accept various payment methods in any of our markets. We are able to deploy our proprietary eCommerce gateway solutions to merchants of all sizes across our global footprint through our direct sales and tech-enabled referral networks. Currently, we provide proprietary, regionally designated eCommerce gateway solutions across Europe, Latin America, and the U.S. We will continue to expand our eCommerce offering, particularly in our international markets, through strategic acquisitions and continued investments in our proprietary and related solutions that align with customer preferences and local government

requirements. For example, in August 2022, we acquired certain technology assets that include shopping cart and website design software that expands our proprietary eCommerce capabilities in Mexico and Chile and decreases our reliance on third parties, and in December 2022, we acquired Electronic Data Processing Source S.A., a leading merchant service provider in Greece to enhance tech-enabled capabilities. Additionally, in June 2021, we acquired Pago Fácil, a leading eCommerce payment gateway in Chile that offers an array of digital payment solutions, including acquiring services, eCommerce software integrations, and value-added solutions that we will leverage across Chile and Mexico. 
​
Our Tech-enabled division represents approximately 43.2% of our Americas revenue and approximately 23.3% of our Europe revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
​
Direct
Our Direct division primarily represents the direct solicitation of merchants through international bank relationships and certain other referral sources in the U.S. and is supported by our worldwide direct sales force. In our international markets, we have long-term, exclusive referral relationships with leading financial institutions that actively pursue new merchant relationships on our behalf. As part of these relationships, we target large merchants through a coordinated sales approach with our financial institution partners. 
​
These financial institutions, including Deutsche Bank USA, Deutsche Bank Group, Grupo Santander, PKO Bank Polski, Bank of Ireland, Raiffeisen Bank, Moneta, Citibanamex, Sabadell, Banco de Crédito e Inversiones (“BCI”), and the National Bank of Greece S.A. (“NBG”), among others, often provide us with access to their brands, significantly enhancing our credibility and recognition in the marketplace. In several markets, we operate with more than one financial institution partner. We also have referral arrangements with a limited number of independent sales organizations (“ISO”) that refer merchants to us.
​
In December 2022, we commenced operations in Greece through our joint venture and exclusive referral relationship with the National Bank of Greece.
​
We utilize a dedicated sales team, including outbound telesales, to build and maintain relationships with our merchants, referral partners, and international bank referral network. We have a long history of operating as a direct sales organization and have succeeded by pursuing merchants through our direct sales efforts and retaining merchants by delivering high levels of customer satisfaction. We view our direct sales force as complementary to our financial institution relationships, as our direct sales force generates new merchant opportunities in addition to the referrals we receive from our various partners. As we expand, we will continue to export our direct sales expertise and capabilities into all of the markets in which we operate, using products and sales practices developed over the years in the United States.
A key component of our Direct division is our highly customized lead management, merchant boarding, and risk management software tools. These technologies allow us to quickly and efficiently accept new merchant leads from sales representatives and bank partners, digitally onboard merchants, and manage transaction risks. In both the financial institution referral model and through our direct sales team, we build and maintain a direct relationship with our merchants in order to control our sales, pricing, underwriting, boarding, and support processes.
Our Direct division is our largest division as our international markets are dominated by referrals from our financial institution partners. This division represents approximately 44.6% of our segment revenue in the Americas and 76.7% in Europe for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Traditional
Our Traditional division is our heritage United States portfolio and is comprised primarily of dormant commercial relationships with independent sales agents, ISOs, and other partners. While this division is very profitable, the independent sales groups and agents are no longer actively referring merchants to us, and as such, this business will decline over time. This division represents approximately 12.2% of our segment revenue in the Americas for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Our competitive strengths
Global footprint enables us to serve clients around the world 
We have operations in 13 countries and the ability to service merchants in more than 50 markets around the world. Our customers include large national and multi-national corporations as well as SMEs spanning across most industry verticals. Our global merchant footprint is diversified among retail, restaurants, petroleum, government, and transit industries, among others.
We have investments and partnerships in fast-growing developing and emerging markets with lower penetration rates of electronic payments, such as Mexico, Chile, and Central and Eastern Europe. In addition, we have established sales channels and relationships in large developed economies, such as the United States, Canada, and certain countries in Western Europe, where the penetration of electronic payments is relatively mature. 
We believe our global footprint is a significant competitive advantage as we compete for large, multi-national clients as well as ISVs, integrated software and ERP dealers, and other partners. Large, multi-national merchants choose us because we can act as a single acquirer and processor in the markets in which they operate. Additionally, because of our global footprint, our referral partners can reach new markets by leveraging their connection with us to access our global processing services.
Strategic distribution partnerships with financial institutions and tech-enabled referral partners
Across Europe and Latin America, our exclusive financial institution distribution relationships represent thousands of bank branches, including retail and corporate banking locations. We are highly selective in identifying optimal distribution partners, and we seek to align ourselves with financial institutions that have strong networks, a high-quality client portfolio, and a trusted brand name. After forming these relationships, we introduce our sales and technology capabilities to the local market, identify new merchant recruitment opportunities, and strengthen our relationships with existing merchant clients as our bank partners exclusively refer their existing and new customers to us for acquiring and processing services. We have experienced significant success in our financial institution alliances in attracting new customers on behalf of our bank partners. By providing high quality, focused services to merchants, we enhance the goodwill between our financial institution partners and their merchants which can, in turn, curb attrition. We have demonstrated success in integrating and cross-selling our services to this expanded merchant base as well as generating new banking customers for our partners through our direct sales strategies.
We have also established deep relationships with a large network of tech-enabled referral partners including ISVs, integrated software dealers, ERP dealers and integrators, eCommerce providers, and other membership or distribution partners that wish to offer payment processing services to their merchant customers. We believe our expertise in serving tech-enabled referral partners is differentiated and enabled by our three proprietary, in-house processing platforms and service-oriented culture. Through a single, easy integration point, partners gain access to our global processing platform and solutions. Furthermore, our commitment to customer service drives high merchant satisfaction levels and has established our strong reputation as a reliable and trusted partner around the world. In the B2B market, our integrations to ERP systems enable us to sell our B2B solutions through a network of ERP system implementers, resellers, and buying groups. We believe our expertise in serving tech-enabled distribution partners is a competitive advantage and will position us for continued growth.
Comprehensive suite of payment and commerce solutions 
We are focused on delivering the products and services that provide optimal value and convenience to our merchants. As such, we continuously survey the competitive landscape and our merchants and leverage our experience in markets throughout the world to develop products, services, pricing, promotions, and partnering strategies for each region that we believe best suits the current and future needs of each market. Our wide-ranging experience serving multi-national merchants in markets around the world, as well as our close relationships with large merchants and various card networks, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, UnionPay, JCB, and other card networks, uniquely position us to stay ahead of major trends in each of our markets.

10



We offer an extensive portfolio of products, services, and pricing solutions with functionality that appeals to a broad range of merchants and that are specifically designed for particular vertical markets. Our extensive product offerings enable us to provide tailored payment solutions to each of our merchants to fit their customized needs.
In addition, because we operate in markets around the world and have a global perspective, we are able to export our strategies and solutions from one market into another. Specifically, EVO Snap provides a technical connection to our proprietary processing systems and a single point of integration for technology partners and merchants across all our markets and geographies. We believe this capability differentiates us from our competitors.
Leading technology and security
As the rate of innovation has increased dramatically, providing payment and commerce solutions to merchants of all types has become increasingly dependent upon a strong foundation of secure and flexible technology. We have designed our technology infrastructure with a singular focus in mind — to provide the products and services our merchants want in the most secure, efficient, and effective manner possible. Underpinning this focus is a worldwide team of professionals from multiple disciplines, dedicated to continuously improving our service levels while expanding our offerings to merchants across the various regions in which we operate. 
Our strategy is to leverage EVO-owned technology in our product and service delivery to the greatest extent possible. We believe that this approach allows us to minimize variable expenses in processing transactions and maximize reliability and speed-to-market in delivering the products and services demanded by our merchant customers throughout our global footprint. In many markets, we provide innovative solutions that merchants are unable to obtain from traditional bank acquirers. We endeavor to export products, services, platforms, and applications that enjoy success in any one of our markets to all of our markets, allowing our merchants and referral partners to benefit from our global footprint and providing a consistent experience for our multinational customers. We employ local product and technical expertise in every EVO market and then tailor our products and services from other regions to capture local market opportunities.
Our product lines consist of a collection of integrated solution offerings, which allow tech-enabled partners to connect to our systems via a simple, single integration, giving them access to our platforms. These product lines include (1) an ISV platform that offers merchants a variety of direct connections to software companies through various integrated software dealers, (2) payment integrations to ERP systems to enable card acceptance from business customers as well as complementary accounts receivable-related automation and reconciliation tools, and (3) robust eCommerce gateway solutions that provide comprehensive payment solutions, including proprietary eCommerce solutions that allow online merchants to leverage our global suite of products, including paperless reporting and boarding.
Our EVO Snap platform is fully EMV (Europay, Mastercard, Visa) compliant and provides an extensive menu of advanced features to our current and prospective integrated software partners, including tokenization, point-to-point encryption, and real-time fraud scoring. We believe this platform also allows us to deliver outsized value to our merchants by providing them with access to a broad range of industry-specific third-party business management software tools at the POS (e.g., inventory management, advanced accounting functions, and real-time promotions), even if the software vendor is located in another market. 
Uninterrupted services are mission-critical to our merchants and referral partners. As such, we have invested in creating a leading technology infrastructure designed to prioritize both efficiency and security. In addition, everything we bring to market is designed and implemented with security as a primary requirement. Our technology infrastructure is supported by professionals with decades of experience in operating high-volume, real-time processing systems and has been developed around our data centers located in the U.S., Mexico, and Poland. We have also designed our environments with the ability to redirect processing to the most appropriate operating location at any given time. This flexibility enables us to continue to offer processing services during catastrophic events and disasters that would otherwise adversely affect our clients.
In addition, we have implemented a formal information security program, EVO Secure, to address threats to our infrastructure. This multi-layered program, led by a team of dedicated security professionals, ensures that we evaluate, defend, monitor, and react to potential threats in a consistent manner across our global network.

Proven management team with strong track record of value-creating acquisitions
Our senior leadership team includes highly experienced payment technology professionals based in the Americas and Europe, allowing us to operate successfully in our current markets while also evaluating new markets. Many of our executives previously worked together in the industry and have extensive experience in developing and managing a global payments company. As we have expanded our international operations, we have invested substantial resources to attract and retain experienced talent with significant in-country experience to further develop and support our current and future markets.
Our senior leadership team has also demonstrated exceptional execution capabilities around developing new markets and sales distribution channels, consolidating and insourcing operations, and leading multi-cultural dispersed teams. They have completed numerous migrations of merchants from third party providers to our proprietary platforms. The team has also successfully formed and maintained complex alliance relationships with many large financial institutions, which provide a significant number of merchant referrals to our business. 
Our growth strategies
We believe our competitive strengths will continue to generate significant growth opportunities in both existing and new markets. We plan to grow our business by executing the following strategies:
Organically growing existing markets 
We believe there is considerable opportunity for growth not only in new markets, but in our existing markets as well. Since 2012, our international operations have grown considerably, accounting for approximately 65% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Many of our international markets are less mature than the United States with respect to the growth drivers of our business. Specifically, these markets exhibit higher overall consumer expenditure growth, provide more opportunity for cash-to-card conversion, have lower penetration of integrated software and eCommerce solutions, and present growth opportunities with new financial institution partners. Furthermore, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen an acceleration in the adoption of digital payments in these markets resulting in an increase in card penetration and processing volumes.
In the United States, Canada and the U.K., which are relatively more mature than our other international markets, we believe there is significant opportunity for sustained, attractive growth in both the integrated software and the B2B channels. Merchants of all sizes are increasingly migrating from standalone terminals to integrated POS solutions, as software becomes more affordable and more customized based on the industry of the merchant. B2B merchants, who have historically low rates of card acceptance compared to business-to-consumer merchants, are now enjoying significant growth because of interchange incentives from the card schemes which lowers the cost of card acceptance based on the data transmitted with each transaction, coupled with the desire to adopt business automation tools available through ERP payment integrations. We have made and continue to make investments through in-house development and acquisitions that secure market-leading technology solutions for both retail management software and ERP solutions, as the growth rates of these channels are superior to that of traditional POS merchants. We expect these growth trends to continue for the foreseeable future.
To continue growing our merchant base we focus primarily on the following strategies:

● | Supporting our existing portfolio and adding new customers. Our existing distribution partners currently service customers that do not utilize our merchant services, which presents business opportunities to cross-sell our services to these existing relationships.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Introducing our comprehensive, global set of payment and commerce solutions to our existing markets. With industry leading products and services, such as our proprietary dynamic currency conversion (“DCC”) technology, our state-of-the-art integrated platform, our suite of ERP payments integrations, and our eCommerce gateway solution, we believe we are uniquely positioned to enable our distribution partners to offer their
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12




merchants the broadest product offering in the market.
------------------------------------------------------


● | Leveraging our global infrastructure to service multinational and enterprise merchants. As a result of having a proprietary integrated platform, we are able to act as a single acquirer and processor for merchants in multiple countries.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customizing solutions to meet in-market needs. We design our products and services to meet the needs of our local customers and partners. We also enable our systems to utilize local alternative payment methods that are present in particular markets, such as Blik in Poland, Giropay in Germany, and Codi in Mexico.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By implementing these strategies, we believe we will increase adoption of our payment and commerce solutions, continue to grow our merchant base, and offer merchants the broadest set of solutions in the market.
Expanding our global footprint 
Our partnership strategy has been a source of significant growth, and we believe it will continue to facilitate growth in the future. Since 2012, we have established bank alliances with leading financial institutions around the world, many of which are exclusive and long-term. For example, we completed our previously announced transaction with the National Bank of Greece and commenced operations in Greece in December 2022 through a joint venture and exclusive referral relationship with the bank. While we have made meaningful headway in penetrating new markets, we believe considerable opportunities remain in both establishing additional bank alliances in our current markets, as well as new markets around the world.
In determining which markets to enter, we evaluate a wide range of factors, including the reputation of our potential bank partner, the size and characteristics of the bank’s existing merchant portfolio, the size and stability of the domestic economy, the stability of the government, card usage penetration, growth prospects, profitability, commerce and technology trends, regulatory and other risks, required investments, management resources, and the likely return on investment. This strategy drives us to expand into select international markets that we believe present attractive investment opportunities for long-term, sustainable merchant growth, as supported by factors such as:

● | low penetration of cards-per capita among consumers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | high volume growth supported by cash-to-card conversion;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | regulatory initiatives implemented with an aim to accelerate card acceptance among merchants;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | less differentiated competitive landscape, given the prevalence of bank-owned acquiring businesses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increased adoption of integrated POS, eCommerce, and integrated technologies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | embedded distribution through partner retail and corporate branch footprint; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ability to launch our product suite and customer-centric services to accelerate end-market growth and acceptance penetration.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We enter new markets by creating distribution relationships with leading, in-market financial institutions that possess a high degree of market knowledge, brand recognition, large distribution networks, and, in many instances, an existing merchant portfolio. These distribution agreements enable us to access a diverse group of merchants, expand the reach of our products and services, and form the basis for future investment in sales and infrastructure. 

13



Broadening our distribution network 
We aim to grow our business and broaden our global reach by generating new distribution relationships that add merchants to our portfolio. We reach new merchants primarily through our direct sales force and referral relationships. Our focus is to build these relationships across all channels, including financial institutions, software vendors, POS dealers, gateway providers, and agents. In addition to developing these growth channels, we are able to leverage our infrastructure both in servicing our existing markets and in expanding to new markets. For example, we have implemented EVO Snap into our European operations, extending the ability for our merchants to access EVO Snap as a single, global integration platform. Through EVO Snap, we also have the ability to support integrated software dealers and distributors in multiple geographic markets. We plan to continue to broaden our distribution network by identifying and securing new distribution opportunities within both our existing and future markets.
Growing and enhancing our innovative payments and commerce solutions 
We believe our innovative payments and commerce solutions represent one of our competitive advantages. We have made significant investments internally and through strategic acquisitions in both technology and personnel to propel our product innovation forward. In order to continue to expand, we believe we must continue to offer our customers leading products and services. Through a combination of building products organically, partnering with leading technology innovators, and selectively pursuing acquisitions, we are constantly driving innovation to enhance our products and services.
Through acquisitions and internal development, we have invested heavily in supporting a diverse network of integrated POS providers, ISVs, and integrated software and ERP dealers. These investments have strengthened our ability to support the software community in the markets where we operate, including POS, mobile, and eCommerce developers, by providing these developers with the tools necessary to develop a broader suite of multi-channel, multi-service solutions for merchants. This distribution-centric strategy has created our key global technology solution, in which software developers can integrate to our proprietary processing platforms and we can sign up tech-enabled solutions providers as strategic distribution partners.
Capitalizing on our operating leverage 
Our focus on cost optimization is a key consideration of any new investment opportunity. The deep industry and operating expertise of our management team enables us to identify opportunities to improve the operating efficiencies of our technology, product, and operations infrastructure. With in-house processing solutions and proprietary internal systems in our Americas and Europe segments, we have the ability to generate significant operating leverage as we grow overall volumes and transactions. With each newly acquired business, we utilize this infrastructure to optimize costs and efficiencies. Through the support and reporting capabilities of our global systems, we eliminate redundancies and improve operating efficiencies post-acquisition.
Our products and services
We offer a comprehensive portfolio of card-present and card-not-present payment solutions for a variety of industry types and business sizes to facilitate merchants accepting credit, debit, prepaid, digital wallets, and other alternative payment methods. Our portfolio of solutions includes EMV, chip and signature enabled POS terminals, virtual POS terminals for desktops, mobile acceptance and mobile point-of-sale (“mPOS”) solutions for mobile devices and tablets, software-based POS solutions, online hosted payments, and integrated payment service provider (“PSP”) solutions for card-not-present bankcard, direct debit, and alternative payment scheme processing. We also offer value-added solutions such as gateway solutions, online hosted payments page capabilities, mobile-based short message service (“SMS”) integrated payment collection services, security tokenization and encryption solutions at the physical and virtual POS, DCC, ACH, Level 2 and Level 3 data processing, management reporting solutions, loyalty programs, and Visa Direct, among other ancillary solutions. Other industry-specific processing capabilities are also in our product suite, such as recurring billing, multi-currency authorization, and cross-border processing and settlement.

Our solutions enable merchants of all sizes to accept digital payments, including credit and debit cards, closed loop gift cards, pre-paid cards, ACH, and other alternative payment methods. This spectrum of solutions includes:

● | EMV chip, magnetic swipe readers, contactless, chip and signature, chip debit, and gift services for hardware terminals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our mPOS solutions and services including mobile SMS payments solutions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | integrations to various ERP systems to provide accounts receivable departments with B2B payments options and automated reconciliations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a variety of eCommerce solutions including gateway and PSP products, online hosted payments pages, payment links, shopping cart-plug-ins, and virtual terminals;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | comprehensive real-time digital and signatureless merchant boarding systems (from application to merchant processing);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | market-specific business models for partners, including PSP and referral programs; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | online reporting systems for partners, integrators, and merchants providing access to our platforms worldwide.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, as a merchant acquirer, we provide in-house customer service utilizing in-market call centers, as we believe customers need to be served locally in market. We also have developed a consolidated shared services operational capability for back-office services, including credit underwriting, risk, chargebacks, and terminal deployment and repair. Our capabilities also include a regionally-based merchant boarding system, risk management, and ISV technology development centers, supporting the Americas and Europe.
Our diverse offerings are supported by our two unique underlying global products, EVO Snap and our proprietary customer relationship management (“CRM”) solutions. EVO Snap is a highly customized, EMV compliant technology platform that allows merchants to easily access our key POS-related products in all of our markets with one single integration, including core processing and value-added services (e.g., ACH, Level 3 processing, DCC). Our merchants and partners benefit from a single global certification and common interface in the Americas and Europe, a key feature for retail and eCommerce merchants and referral partners with a global customer base. This common application programming interface (“API”) allows ISVs and developers to seamlessly integrate to EVO Snap and access all of its new features.
Our global, state-of-the-art CRM solutions enable all merchants, whether they are recruited through our financial institutions, direct sales, or partner channels, to be seamlessly managed throughout the merchant lifecycle. We provide all partners and agents access to these tools to ensure effective digital customer lifecycle management by streamlining the boarding and management of merchants and supporting our digital payment product and service solutions.
Our markets
Americas
Latin America. We believe that the merchant acquiring market in Mexico represents a very attractive growth opportunity, as overall card penetration is significantly lower than that of the United States. As card penetration continues to increase, we expect to enjoy outsized benefits as the only scaled independent acquirer in the market. In July 2019, we acquired the payment technology assets of SF Systems in Mexico, enhancing our ability to offer integrated payment solutions to mid-sized and large merchants within the region. Additionally, we are introducing our tech-enabled solutions, particularly integrated payments and eCommerce, in order to develop those aspects of the market. We see significant opportunity to differentiate from our competitors, principally financial institutions who view acquiring as a tertiary product necessary to attract core banking business.

The merchant acquiring market in Chile closely mirrors that of Mexico, with relatively low card penetration among both consumers and merchants and very little competition for acquiring services. For years the acquiring and processing markets have been serviced only by a bank-owned monopoly. Today, only two financial institutions have migrated from the historical structure to offer proprietary solutions, and our bank partner BCI is the only financial institution that has partnered with an independent acquirer. To augment our local product offerings, we acquired Pago Fácil, a payment gateway headquartered in Santiago, in 2021. We have further enhanced Pago Fácil to meet the needs of our Mexican merchants and will further leverage the platform in additional markets in the region as we enter them. In addition, in 2022, we acquired certain technology assets that include shopping cart and website design software that expands our proprietary eCommerce capabilities in Mexico and Chile and decreases our reliance on third parties. We are focused on supplementing our bank partner’s distribution network with EVO’s proprietary sales strategies and product offerings, including through new and existing ISV and eCommerce referral partnerships.
U.S. and Canada. Card penetration in the United States and Canada is among the highest in the world. The largest growth opportunity in these markets is arising from the adoption of business management software with embedded payment processing functionalities as merchants are making an effort to enhance the payments experience for their customers. The cost of these solutions has declined sufficiently to make them affordable for merchants of all sizes, which is causing these solutions to displace standalone terminals at the POS. Examples of this trend include integrated solutions at the physical POS, ERP integrations for B2B digital payment acceptance, and eCommerce platforms. Merchant acquirers are capitalizing on this trend by entering into referral arrangements with technology companies and integrating acquiring services into their software. We have been particularly active in this market, preferring to partner with technology and software providers rather than acquire them in order to leverage our partners' software development expertise and to avoid channel conflicts. Additionally, our EVO Snap platform allows us to provide our partners integrated solutions with a single connection point that is fully integrated with our front-end authorization systems across all transaction types, including card-present, card-not-present, and mobile. EVO Snap, along with other innovations in our integrated products, has been accretive to our growth in the Americas. Through the acquisition of Sterling in 2017, we gained a significant number of new integrated relationships, and we have continued to make acquisitions, as well as investments in our proprietary capabilities, to broaden our tech-enabled offering.
Europe
Across most of our European markets, we believe there is significant opportunity for growth as overall card penetration is relatively immature compared to countries such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Additionally, the trends in payment technologies are changing across our markets due to the evolving payment industry reforms in Europe, ongoing cash-to-card conversion, and increased adoption of tech-enabled payments solutions. We believe that these trends coupled with our positioning across Europe provide significant opportunities to launch new products and services at the early stage of merchant adoption of market innovations, such as gateway integrations and integrated solutions, enhance our market share and growth in existing markets, and capitalize on future investment opportunities in adjacent countries.
Under the European Payment Services Directive of 2015 (“PSD2”), we hold Payments Institution (“PI”) licenses, which enable non-financial institutions to participate in the payments industry subject to stringent regulatory requirements. We currently hold PI licenses in three markets: Germany, Poland and Spain, which enable us to operate as a direct member of the payment card networks. In some markets outside the European Union (the “EU”), applicable regulations and the local and international networks generally require non-financial institutions similar to us to be sponsored by a bank to become an acquirer. The ability to participate in the EU payments industry with direct licenses and without the requirement for third-party sponsorship provides us with greater flexibility and control of our Europe business at a lower cost.
Our competition
We compete with a variety of merchant acquirers that have different business models, go-to-market strategies, and technical capabilities in the markets in which we operate. Our competitors range in both size and geographic reach. In the United States and Canada, we primarily compete with independent merchant acquirers including Fiserv, Inc. (“Fiserv”), Global Payments, Inc. (“Global Payments”), and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (“FIS”), in addition to the merchant acquiring and processing divisions of certain financial institutions, including Chase Paymentech Solutions, LLC and Elavon, Inc. (“Elavon”), a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp. In certain instances we may also compete with smaller U.S.-

16



based financial technology companies, including vertically focused organizations. In Europe, we compete primarily with Barclaycard, a subsidiary of Barclays PLC, Elavon, Global Payments, FIS, Fiserv, Nexi S.p.A. (“Nexi”), Worldline SA, and Polskie ePłatności, a subsidiary of Nexi, in addition to in-market financial institutions. In Mexico, financial institutions remain the primary providers of payment processing services to merchants.
Our broad and differentiated product offerings, service proposition, pricing, and distribution strategies in our geographically diverse markets drive our ability to compete effectively through the acceptance and use of our payment and commerce solutions by merchants. We specifically focus on the primary customer needs of speed, reliability, and reconciliation, ensuring that, at a minimum, our systems, solutions, products, and service models prioritize these and other customer expectations.
Our intellectual property
Our products and services utilize a combination of proprietary software and hardware that we own and license from third parties. Our owned intellectual property is protected by federal patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law, as well as state trade secret laws, as appropriate. We generally control access to, and use of, our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with both our employees and third parties.
As of December 31, 2022, we had two pending patent applications covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology, including our EVO Snap product, and new integrated product innovations. In addition, we own a portfolio of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions around the world, including for our primary mark, EVO.
Our regulatory environment
Various aspects of our service areas are subject to U.S. federal, state and local regulation, as well as regulation outside the United States. Certain of our services also are subject to rules promulgated by various card networks and banking and other authorities as more fully described below.
Financial services regulations
As a result of the implementation of the Payment Services Directive of 2007 in the EU, a number of our subsidiaries in our Europe segment hold a PI license which allows them to operate in the EU member states in which such subsidiaries and their branches do business. As a PI, we are subject to regulation and oversight in the applicable EU member states, which includes, among other obligations, a requirement to maintain specified regulatory capital and adhere to certain rules regarding the conduct of our business. In July 2013, the European Commission proposed legislation in two parts, covering a wide range of proposed regulatory reforms affecting the payments industry across the EU. The first part was an EU-wide regulation on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions (the “Interchange Fee Regulation”). The Interchange Fee Regulation (2015/751) went into effect in June 2015. The second part, PSD2, was a recasting of the Payment Services Directive of 2007. PSD2 went into effect in January 2016 and was later transposed to national law across EU member states. PSD2 contains a number of additional regulatory provisions, including provisions relating to enhanced governance requirements (including stronger focus on risk management), new consumer-centric transparency regulations and Strong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) principles, which increased the security of electronic payments by requiring multi-factor user authentication and required industry-wide systems upgrades. The EU has also enacted regulations relating to the offering of DCC services which require additional disclosures to consumers in connection with our DCC product offerings in a number of markets. Further, several of our international subsidiaries provide services that make them subject to regulation by local banking agencies and other regulatory authorities. As a result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (“Brexit”), we successfully completed an application for a stand-alone PI license which was granted in early 2023. We are currently focused on finalizing license requirements with the relevant card schemes and transitioning EVO’s current U.K. operations, which is currently being conducted under the U.K.’s temporary permissions regime, to the newly licensed entity.

Association and network rules
We are subject to the rules of Mastercard, Visa, and other credit and debit networks. In order to provide processing services, a number of our subsidiaries are registered with Visa or Mastercard as service providers for member institutions. Various subsidiaries of ours are also processor level members of numerous debit and electronic benefits transaction networks or are otherwise subject to various network rules in connection with processing services and other services we provide. As such, we are subject to applicable network rules and to a variety of fines or penalties that may be administered by the card networks. Although these rules are not government regulations, any failure to comply with the networks’ requirements or to pay the fines they impose could cause the termination of our registration and require us to stop providing payment processing services. For example, “EMV” is a credit and debit card authentication methodology that the card networks are requiring processors, issuers, and acquirers to implement. Compliance deadlines for EMV mandates vary by country and by payment network. In addition, card networks and their member financial institutions regularly update, and generally expand, security expectations and requirements related to the security of cardholder data and environments. We are also subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Association relating to payment transactions processed by us using the ACH Network and to various state federal and foreign laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to electronic benefits transactions. 
The Dodd-Frank Act
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act resulted in significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. Among other things, Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) to regulate consumer financial products and services. The CFPB enforces prohibitions against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices under the Dodd-Frank Act and may have authority over us as a provider of services to regulated financial institutions in connection with consumer financial products. 
Separately, under the Dodd-Frank Act, debit interchange transaction fees are regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing, and settling the transaction. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions that ban debit card networks from entering into exclusivity arrangements, prohibit card issuers and card networks from imposing transaction routing requirements, and require card issuers to enable at least two unaffiliated networks on each debit card.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits merchants to set minimum dollar amounts for the acceptance of a credit card (while federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education may set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards), and to provide discounts or incentives to consumers who pay with alternative payment methods, such as cash, checks or debit cards.
Privacy and information security regulations
We provide services that may be subject to various state, federal, and foreign privacy laws and regulations, including, among others, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (the “Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act”), PSD2, the General Data Protection Directive (“GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada. These laws and their implementing regulations generally restrict certain collection, processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information. These laws also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards. Certain federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations impose similar privacy obligations and, in certain circumstances, obligations to notify affected individuals, state officers or other governmental authorities, the public, and consumer reporting agencies, as well as businesses and governmental agencies, of security breaches affecting personal information. In addition, there are state and foreign laws restricting the ability to collect and utilize certain types of information such as social security and driver’s license numbers. In July 2016, the European Parliament adopted an EU-wide directive on security of network and information systems (the “NIS Directive”). The NIS Directive provides legal measures intended to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU and required that EU member states enact related national laws to enforce certain cybersecurity obligations.

The CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020 and established strict data privacy and data protection requirements for the data of California residents. The CCPA has been amended and it is likely that further amendments will be proposed to this legislation. As such, it remains unclear how certain provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. 
As a processor of personal data of EU data subjects, we are subject to regulation and oversight in the applicable EU member states with regard to data protection legislation. GDPR contains various obligations on the processing of personal data in the EU, including restrictions on transferring personal data outside of the EU. Post-Brexit, the UK has implemented GDPR into domestic law through the Data Protection Act and the UK GDPR. 
GDPR contains additional obligations on data controllers and data processors operating in the EU. GDPR also provides significant enhancements with regard to the rights of data subjects (which include the right to be forgotten and the right of data portability), stricter regulation on obtaining consent to processing of personal data and sensitive personal data, stricter obligations with regard to the information in privacy notices, and significant enhanced requirements with regard to compliance, including a regime of “accountability” for processors and controllers and a requirement to adopt appropriate policies and practices. GDPR includes enhanced data security obligations (to run in parallel to those contained in NIS regulations), requiring data processors and controllers to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data they process and their systems. Organizations that process significant amounts of data may be required to appoint a data protection officer to oversee and manage compliance with GDPR. We have appointed data protection officers in several of our businesses. There are significant fines and other sanctions under GDPR for failing to comply with the core principles of the GDPR or failing to secure data.
Unfair trade practice regulations
We and our clients are subject to various federal, state, and international laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices, such as Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Various regulatory agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, various consumer protection agencies in Europe and other international markets, the CFPB, and state attorneys general, have authority to take action against parties that engage in unfair or deceptive trade practices or violate other laws, rules, and regulations. To the extent we are processing payments for a client that may be in violation of these regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions by those agencies and may incur losses that impact our business.
Anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, sanctions, and counter-terrorist regulations
We are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including certain sections of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and other laws, that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures and include anti-bribery provisions enforced by the Department of Justice and accounting provisions enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The FCPA has a broad reach and requires maintenance of appropriate records and adequate internal controls to prevent and detect possible FCPA violations. Many other jurisdictions where we conduct business also have similar anti-corruption laws and regulations. We have policies, procedures, systems, and controls designed to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions under such laws and regulations.
We are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from, or dealings with, specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations. We may be subject to additional local sanctions requirements in other relevant jurisdictions.
Similar anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to electronic currency transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalents to OFAC lists in certain other countries. These laws require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process and our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to such data retention obligations. For example, in the EU, our businesses are subject to requirements under the Fifth Money Laundering Directive ((EU) 2018/843) which has now been implemented in all European jurisdictions in which EVO operates.

Our employees
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 2,400 employees in 13 countries with the majority of employees in the United States, Mexico, and Poland. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
We recognize that the talents and efforts of our employees are integral to our success as a company. EVO’s GET. GROW. KEEP. (“GGK”) culture represents a cornerstone of our talent strategy, which uses people-focused programs supported by human resources technology to attract (GET), develop (GROW) and retain (KEEP) the talent necessary to drive our growth and success. For our existing employees, we utilize our global People Development Portal (“Global PDP”) to implement our talent management programs, including (i) our annual performance evaluation process and goal setting, and (ii) mandatory training and development curriculum for our employees.
Our global onboarding and recruiting technology platform allows us to attract and reach more candidates through multiple recruiting avenues and to improve our overall recruitment process. This platform engages new employees at onboarding and introduces them to our GGK culture including our five core values of integrity, service, teamwork, ownership and diversity. We believe that our culture creates a diverse, collaborative, respectful and safe workplace. To strengthen this culture, we recognize our colleagues whose behaviors and actions demonstrate the GGK culture and our values through multiple recognition programs.
Our executive management team and Human Resources department regularly review and update our talent strategy, monitoring a variety of data, including turnover, compensation and benefits benchmarking, diversity, and employee engagement, to design and implement effective reward/recognition, training, development, succession, and benefit programs to meet the needs of our businesses and our employees.
