ITEM 1.          BUSINESS
General
USA Truck is one of North America’s top 25 truckload carriers when measured by operating revenue, as determined by Transport Topics’ most recent annual ranking. In 2019, the Company generated $522.6 million in consolidated operating revenue. As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s fleet consisted of 1,990 tractors, which included 421 independent contractor tractors, and 6,212 trailers.
The Company has two reportable segments: (i) Trucking, consisting of the Company’s truckload and dedicated freight service offerings, and (ii) USAT Logistics, consisting of the Company’s freight brokerage and rail intermodal service offerings. The Company’s Trucking segment transports customer freight over irregular routes utilizing equipment owned or leased by either the Company or independent contractors as a medium-haul common carrier. Our dedicated freight services provide similar freight transport services, but do so pursuant to agreements whereby the Company makes equipment available to a specific customer for shipments over particular routes at specified times, typically over a multi-year period. USAT Logistics provides freight brokerage, logistics, and intermodal rail service to its customers by utilizing third party capacity.
As of December 31, 2019, our corporate structure included USA Truck Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries: International Freight Services, Inc. (“IFS”), a Delaware corporation; Davis Transfer Company Inc. (“DTC”), a Georgia corporation, Davis Transfer Logistics Inc. (“DTL”), a Georgia corporation, and B & G Leasing, L.L.C. (“B & G”), a Georgia limited liability company. Collectively, B & G, DTC, and DTL comprise “Davis Transfer Company”.
Operations
USA Truck is headquartered in Van Buren, Arkansas. The Company transports freight throughout the contiguous United States, into and out of portions of Canada, and into and out of Mexico by offering through-trailer service from our terminal in Laredo, Texas. During 2019 and 2018, the Company generated approximately 7% and 8%, respectively, of the Company’s operating revenues in Mexico and Canada. All Company-owned tractors are domiciled in the United States. The Company does not separately track domestic and foreign long-lived assets, as substantially all of the Company’s long-lived assets are located within the United States.
The Company’s Trucking segment operations are supported primarily by driver managers, load planners and customer service representatives. Driver managers lead teams of professional drivers and are the primary Company contact for each of our driver team members. Load planners assign loads to available tractors in a manner intended to maximize profit and minimize costs. Customer service representatives work to fulfill shippers’ needs, solicit freight, and ensure on-time delivery by monitoring load movement. These teams monitor the location of equipment and direct its movement in a safe, efficient and practicable manner. The Company strives to operate a safe and productive fleet while providing superior customer service.
The USAT Logistics segment has a network of regional sales offices located throughout the continental United States. We believe that regionalization allows greater market insight and strengthens relationships with customers and carriers alike while capitalizing on the skills and local market insight of the leaders managing these centers. The specific locations of branch offices are selected for the availability of talent in those markets. At December 31, 2019, USAT Logistics employed approximately 95 people, most of which interact directly with customers and carriers, matching customers’ freight needs with available third-party capacity in the marketplace.
The Company has a diversified freight and customer base, and focuses marketing efforts on customers who have consistent shipping needs within the eastern half of the United States, which is the predominant operating area for our Trucking operations. USAT Logistics offers services nationwide, and the cross-marketing of service offerings permits us to strategically position available equipment while providing a full array of supply chain transportation solutions to our customers. USA Truck team members have cultivated a thorough understanding of the needs of shippers in key industries, which the Company believes helps with the development of long-term, service-oriented relationships with its customers. 
While the Company prefers direct relationships with customers, some high volume shippers require their carriers to 

5
​



conduct business with designated third party logistics providers. Obtaining shipments through these providers is a significant opportunity that allows the Company to provide services for high-volume shippers to which it might not otherwise have access. During 2019, one customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated operating revenues. USAT Logistics was also dependent upon a single customer for more than 10% of its operating revenue. The Company’s largest 10 customers comprised approximately 47% of the Company’s consolidated operating revenue. Overall in 2019, the Company provided services to more than 800 customers across all USA Truck service offerings. 
Receivables collection during 2019 averaged approximately 35 days from the invoice date, compared to an average of approximately 38 days during 2018. Factors contributing to the improvement in days to collection in 2019 were the result of coordination with customers to expedite their payment processes, where applicable, and more efficient and expedient invoicing and collections efforts by our accounts receivable team.

The average age of the Company’s in-service tractor fleet was approximately 30.8 months at December 31, 2019. The Company’s equipment purchase and replacement decisions are based on a number of factors, including but not limited to, new equipment prices, the used equipment market, trade-in values, demand for freight services, prevailing interest rates, the attractiveness of lease terms, technological improvements, regulatory changes, fuel efficiency, equipment durability, equipment specifications and driver comfort. Therefore, depending on the circumstances, the Company may accelerate or delay the acquisition and disposition of its tractors or trailers from time to time, or may choose to acquire revenue equipment through operating leases or financed purchases.
To simplify driver and mechanic training, control the cost of spare parts and tire inventory, and provide for a more efficient vehicle maintenance program, the Company purchases tractors and trailers manufactured to its specifications. The Company has in place a preventive maintenance program intended to minimize equipment downtime and maintenance costs.
The Company finances the purchase of revenue equipment through its cash flows from operations, revolving credit agreement, finance and operating lease arrangements and proceeds from sales of used equipment. Substantially all of the Company’s tractors and trailers are pledged to secure its obligations under financing arrangements.

All Company and independent contractor tractors are equipped with in-cab communication technology, enabling two-way communications between the Company and its drivers, through both standardized and free-form messaging, including electronic logging. The Company also has installed electronic logging devices (“ELDs”) on 100% of its tractor fleet. This technology enables USA Truck to dispatch drivers efficiently in response to customers’ requests, to provide real-time information to customers about the status of their shipments and to provide documentation supporting accessorial charges. Accessorial charges are charges to customers for additional services such as loading, unloading and detainment or equipment delays. In addition, the Company utilizes satellite-based equipment tracking devices and cargo sensors on the majority of its trailers. These tracking devices provide the Company with visibility on the locations and load status of its trailers. The Company has also equipped the Company’s tractor fleet with forward-facing and in-ward facing event recorders.
Team Members
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately 2,050 team members across all business segments, of which approximately 69% were Company drivers. The Company believes team member relations to be good, and no team members are subject to union contracts or part of a collective bargaining unit. 
Recruitment, training, and retention of a professional driver workforce, the Company’s most valuable asset, are essential to the Company’s continued growth and fulfillment of customer needs. USA Truck hires qualified professional drivers who hold a valid commercial driver’s license, satisfy applicable federal and state safety performance and measurement requirements, and meet USA Truck’s hiring criteria. These guidelines relate primarily to safety history, road test evaluations, and various other evaluations, which include physical examinations and mandatory drug and alcohol testing. In order to attract and retain safe drivers who are committed to customer service and safety, the Company focuses its driver operations around a collaborative and supportive team environment. The Company provides comfortable, late model equipment, encourages direct communication with senior management, and pays competitive wages and benefits, and other incentives intended to encourage driver safety, retention, and long-term employment. Drivers are compensated on a per mile basis, based on the length of haul and a predetermined number of miles. Drivers are also compensated for accessorial services provided to customers. Drivers and other employees are encouraged to participate in the Company’s 401(k) program, and Company-sponsored health, life, and dental plans. The Company believes these factors aid in attracting, recruiting, and retaining professional drivers in a competitive driver market.
Independent Contractors
In addition to Company drivers, USA Truck enters into contracts with independent contractors, who provide a tractor and a driver and are responsible for all operating expenses in exchange for an agreed upon fee structure. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 421 independent contractor operated tractors, which comprised approximately 21% of the professional driving fleet during 2019, compared to approximately 24% at December 31, 2018.
Competition
The trucking industry includes both private fleets and for-hire carriers. Private fleets consist of trucks owned and operated by shippers that move their own goods. For-hire carriers include both truckload and less-than-truckload (“LTL”) operations. The for-hire segment is highly competitive and includes thousands of carriers, none of which controls a meaningful share of the market. This segment is characterized by many small carriers having revenues of less than $1 million per year and as few as one truck, and relatively few carriers with revenues exceeding $100 million per year.
USA Truck competes primarily with other truckload carriers, private fleets and, to a lesser extent, railroads and LTL carriers. The principal competitive factors in the truckload segment of the industry are service and price, with rate discounting becoming particularly important during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty. USA Truck’s focus is to differentiate itself primarily on the basis of service rather than rates. Although an increase in the size of the market would benefit all truckload carriers, management believes that successful carriers are likely to grow market share by providing multiple service offerings, combined with superior customer service, at a competitive price.

Safety and Risk Management
The Company emphasizes safe work habits as a core value throughout the entire organization, and provides proactive training and education relating to safety concepts, processes and procedures. The Company conducts pre-employment, random, reasonable suspicion and post-accident alcohol and substance abuse testing in accordance with the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) regulations and the Company’s own policies.
Safety training for new drivers begins in orientation, when newly hired team members are taught safe driving and work techniques that emphasize the Company’s commitment to safety. Upon completion of orientation, new student drivers are required to undergo on-the-road training for four to six weeks with experienced commercial motor vehicle drivers who have been selected for their professionalism and commitment to safety and who are trained to communicate safe driving techniques to new drivers. New drivers who graduate from the program must also successfully complete post-training classroom and road testing before being assigned to their own tractor. Additionally, all Company drivers participate in on-going training that focuses on collision and injury prevention, among other safety concepts.
The primary risks for which the Company is insured are cargo loss and damage, general liability, personal injury, property damage, workers’ compensation and employee medical expenses. USA Truck is self-insured for a portion of claims exposure in each of these areas. The Company’s self-insurance retention levels are $0.5 million for workers’ compensation claims per occurrence, $0.05 million for cargo loss and damage claims per occurrence and $1.0 million for bodily injury and property damage claims per occurrence. For medical benefits, the Company self-insures up to $0.25 million per plan participant per year with an aggregate claim exposure limit determined by the Company’s year-to-date claims experience and its number of covered team members. During the most recent renewal, the Company entered into multi-year structured insurance agreements in the $2 million to $10 million layer, locking in capacity and premiums for the policy term. While there is increased risk, the Company believes the structure of the agreements shares the risk between the Company and providers. The Company maintains insurance above the amounts for which it self-insures, subject to certain limits, with licensed insurance carriers. The Company has excess general, auto and employer’s liability coverage in amounts substantially exceeding minimum legal requirements. The Company is completely self-insured for physical damage to its own tractors and trailers, except that the Company carries catastrophic physical damage coverage to protect against natural disasters.
Although the Company believes the aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims, it is possible that one or more claims could exceed the Company’s aggregate coverage limits. An unexpected loss or changing conditions in the insurance market could adversely affect premium levels or result in our inability to find excess coverage in amounts we deem sufficient. As a result, the Company’s insurance and claims expense could increase, or the Company could raise its self-insured retention or decrease its aggregate coverage limits when its policies are renewed or replaced. If these costs increase, if reserves are increased, if the Company becomes unable to find excess coverage in amounts it deems sufficient, if claims in excess of coverage limits are experienced, or if a claim is experienced where coverage is not provided, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition in any one quarter or annual period could be materially and adversely affected.
Environmental Regulation
In August 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) adopted final rules that established the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, including the tractors the Company employs (the “Phase 1 Standards”). The Phase 1 Standards apply to tractor model years 2014 to 2018 and require the achievement of an approximate 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption by the 2018 model year, which equates to approximately four fewer gallons of fuel used for every 100 miles traveled. In October 2016, the EPA and NHTSA published the final rule mandating the next phase of tighter fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for medium and heavy-duty tractors and trailers (the “Phase 2 Standards”) that apply to trailers beginning with model year 2018 and will apply to tractors beginning with model year 2021. The Phase 2 Standards require nine percent and twenty-five percent reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for trailers and tractors, respectively, by 2027. The Company believes these requirements could result in increased new tractor and trailer prices and additional parts and maintenance costs required to retrofit its tractors and trailers with technology to achieve compliance with such standards, which could adversely affect its operating results and profitability, particularly if such 

8
​



costs are not offset by potential fuel savings. The Company cannot predict, however, the extent to which its operations and productivity will be impacted. In October 2017, the EPA announced a proposal to repeal the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to gliders (which mix refurbished older components, including transmissions and pre-emission-rule engines, with a new frame, cab, steer axle, wheels, and other standard equipment). Additionally, implementation of the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to trailers has been delayed due to a provisional stay granted in October 2017 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is overseeing a case against the EPA and NHTSA by the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association (“TTMA”) regarding the Phase 2 Standards. In August 2018, the TTMA filed a motion to compel the agencies to submit a detailed status report and timeline for the completion of administrative review. The EPA opposed the motion stating that it was working to develop a proposed rule while the NHTSA opposed the motion on the grounds that it is continuing to assess next steps. The federal stay has been renewed every 90 days, the EPA has failed to file any meaningful status reports, and, consequently, the TTMA, on December 3, 2019, filed a motion requesting the Court move forward with its final determination in light of the lack of progress. On December 26, 2019, the Court lifted the abeyance on TTMA’s challenge to the Phase 2 Standards, and set a schedule for final briefs to be filed by June 2, 2020. If the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 Standards are permanently removed, the Company expects that Phase 2 Standards would have a reduced impact on its operations.
The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) also adopted emission control regulations that will apply to all heavy-duty tractors that pull 53-foot or longer box-type trailers within the State of California regardless of the state of origin. The tractors and trailers subject to these CARB regulations must be either EPA SmartWay certified or equipped with low-rolling resistance tires and retrofitted with SmartWay-approved aerodynamic technologies. The Company currently purchases SmartWay certified equipment in its new tractor and trailer acquisitions. In addition, in February 2017 CARB proposed additional phase 2 standards that generally align with the federal Phase 2 standards with respect to model year 2018 to 2021 tractors, with some minor additional requirements. As proposed, the enhanced California standards would stay in place even if the federal standards are vacated or otherwise diminished due to legislative or executive action. CARB approved these standards in September 2018, and set a January 1, 2020 implementation date. However, in December 2019, due to continuing uncertainty surrounding the federal rules on which the California standards are based, including the TTMA litigation and EPA inaction, CARB suspended enforcement of these standards for at least two years. We will continue monitoring any developments with respect to CARB regulations.
Federal and state lawmakers also have proposed potential limits on carbon emissions under a variety of climate-change proposals. In December 2018, a coalition of nine Northeast and mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia announced an agreement to develop regional limits on carbon emissions from transportation sources. Compliance with such regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors, may increase the cost of any new trailers that we will operate, may require us to retrofit certain of our pre-2011 model year trailers that operate in California, and could impair equipment productivity and increase our operating expenses, including with respect to our Plus Power fleet. Even though most of these proposals are yet to become law, these adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of these vehicles, could materially increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations.
In order to reduce exhaust emissions, some states and municipalities have begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors may idle. Further, the Phase 2 Standards include requirements to reduce particulate emissions caused by idling diesel engines. These restrictions could force the Company to purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or to alter our drivers’ behavior, either of which could result in a decrease in productivity, or increase in driver turnover.
The Company’s terminals often are located in industrial areas where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred or could occur. The Company’s operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. Certain of the Company’s facilities have oil and/or fuel storage tanks and fueling islands. A small percentage of the Company’s freight consists of low-grade hazardous substances, which subjects it to a wide array of regulations. The Company has instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations; however, if (i) the Company is involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances; (ii) there are releases of hazardous substances the Company transports; (iii) soil or groundwater contamination is found at the Company’s facilities or results from its operations; or (iv) the Company is found to be in violation of, or fails to comply with, applicable environmental

​



laws or regulations, then it could be subject to clean-up costs and liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.
Other Regulation
The Company’s operations are regulated and licensed by various United States federal and state, Canadian provincial, and Mexican federal agencies. Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the DOT. Matters such as weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to United States federal and state regulation and Canadian provincial regulations. The Company operates in the United States pursuant to operating authority granted by the DOT, in various Canadian provinces pursuant to operating authority granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communications in such provinces, and within Mexico pursuant to operating authority granted by Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes. To the extent that the Company conducts operations outside the United States, it is subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits United States companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining favorable treatment.
The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), imposes safety and fitness regulations on the Company and its drivers, including rules that restrict driver hours-of-service (“HOS”). Changes to such HOS rules can negatively impact the Company’s productivity and affect its operations and profitability by reducing the number of hours per day or week its drivers may operate and/or disrupting its network. In 2018, FMCSA announced that it would revisit HOS rules and solicited public comment. In response to the comments receive, on August 22, 2019, FMCSA released proposed rulemaking. The proposed rule would revise existing HOS rules in order to alleviate unnecessary burdens placed on drivers in five key areas: (1) extending the 14-hour on-duty limitation by up to two hours during adverse driving conditions, (2) revising mandatory breaks after 8-hours of continuous driving, (3) reinstating the option for splitting up the required 10-hour off-duty rest break for drivers operating trucks that are equipped with a sleeper-berth compartment, (4) expanding short-haul exemptions from 12 hours on-duty to 14 hours on-duty and extending the distance limit within which the driver may operate from 100 air miles to 150 air miles in order to be consistent with the rules for long-haul drivers, and (5) allowing a one off-duty break of at least 30 minutes, but not more than three hours, that would pause a truck driver’s 14-hour driving window, provided the driver takes 10 consecutive hours off-duty at the end of the work shift. The proposed rule underwent a public comment period that ended in October 2019. While the proposed rulemaking may alleviate certain burdens on the Company’s productivity and operations, any future changes to HOS rules could materially and adversely affect the Company’s operations and profitability.
There are two methods of evaluating the safety and fitness of carriers. The first method is the application of a safety rating that is based on an onsite investigation. The Company currently has a satisfactory DOT safety rating under this method, which is the highest available rating under the current safety rating scale. If the Company were to receive a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could affect or restrict our operations as well as adversely affect the Company’s business, as some of its existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating. In January 2016, FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking outlining a revised safety rating measurement system, which would replace the current methodology. Under the proposed rule, the current three safety ratings of “satisfactory,” “conditional,” and “unsatisfactory” would be replaced with a single safety rating of “unfit,” and a carrier would be deemed fit when no rating was assigned. Moreover, the proposed rules would use roadside inspection data, in addition to investigations and onsite reviews, to determine a carrier’s safety fitness on a monthly basis. Under the current rules, a safety rating can only be given upon completion of a comprehensive onsite audit or review. The proposed rule underwent a public comment period that ended in June 2016 and several industry groups and lawmakers expressed their disagreement with the proposed rule, arguing that it violates the requirements of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (the “FAST Act”) and that FMCSA must first finalize its review of the Compliance Safety Accountability (“CSA”) program scoring system, described in further detail below. Based on this feedback and other concerns raised by industry stakeholders, in March 2017, FMCSA withdrew the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking related to the new safety rating system. In its notice of withdrawal, the FMCSA noted that a new rulemaking related to a similar process may be initiated in the future. Therefore, it is uncertain if, when, or under what form any such rule could be implemented.
In addition to the safety rating system, FMCSA has adopted the CSA program as an additional safety enforcement and compliance model that evaluates and ranks fleets on certain safety-related standards. The CSA program analyzes data 

10
​



from roadside inspections, moving violations, crash reports from the last two years, and investigation results. The data is organized into seven categories. Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (e.g., crashes, inspections, or violations) and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold. CSA scores are used by FMCSA to identify carriers with potential safety issues for interventions, including warning letters, inspections, and audits that can then lead to more formal agency action. Additionally, a poor score may (i) impact driver recruiting and retention by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers, (ii) cause the Company’s customers to direct their business away from the Company and to carriers with higher fleet rankings, (iii) subject the Company to an increase in compliance reviews and roadside inspections, (iv) increase insurance costs, or (v) cause the Company to incur greater than expected expenses in its attempts to improve unfavorable scores, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and profitability.
Under the CSA program, these scores were initially made available to the public in five of the seven categories. However, pursuant to the FAST Act, which was signed into law in December 2015, FMCSA was required to remove from public view the previously available CSA scores while it reviews the reliability of the scoring system. During this period of review by FMCSA, the Company will continue to have access to its scores and will still be subject to intervention by FMCSA when such scores are above the intervention thresholds. A congressionally mandated report by the National Academy of Sciences related to the CSA program was released in June 2017 which recommended: (i) reconfiguring the underlying statistical model under the CSA’s Safety Measurement System (the percentile ranking categories used to target carriers for intervention) with a so-called item response theory model to more accurately target at-risk carriers, (ii) making the scoring system more transparent and easier for carriers to replicate and understand, and (iii) departing from using relative metrics as the sole means for targeting carriers. In response to this report, FMCSA has created a small-scale IRT model but, due to data deficiencies and concerns that the complex model could not be adequately explained to both the trucking industry and the public, FMCSA has stated that it will not decide on whether to create and adopt the full-scale IRT model until September 2020. FMCSA has also updated the CSA website improving data accessibility for enforcement users and carriers subject to the program. In June 2019, a federal appropriations bill was introduced that, if passed, would force FMCSA to restore public access to the CSA. This bill has yet to advance beyond the House Appropriations Committee. Insofar as any of these changes increase the likelihood of us receiving unfavorable scores or mandate the FMCSA to restore public access to scores, our results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected. The Company will continue to monitor FMCSA’s ITM testing and subsequent proposed rules that may affect the scoring methodology in order to continue to promote improvement of scores in all seven categories with ongoing reviews of all safety-related policies, programs and procedures for their effectiveness.
We have on certain occasions exceeded the established intervention thresholds in a number of the seven CSA safety-related categories. Based on these unfavorable ratings, our driver fleet could be prioritized for intervention actions or roadside inspections, either of which could have a materially adverse effect our results of operations. In addition, customers may be less likely to assign loads to us. We have put procedures in place in an attempt to address areas where we have exceeded the thresholds. However, we cannot guarantee these measures will be effective.
In 2015, FMCSA issued final rules requiring nearly all carriers, including the Company, to install and use ELDs in their tractors by December 2019, in order to electronically monitor truck miles and enforce HOS. Carriers are subject to citations, on a state-by-state basis, for non-compliance with the rule. The Company was compliant with ELDs on 100% of all required vehicles prior to the December 2019 deadline.
In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, federal, state and municipal authorities implemented and continue to implement various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. The Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) has adopted regulations that require determination by the TSA that each driver who applies for or renews his license for carrying hazardous materials is not a security threat. These regulations were adopted as final on October 1, 2019.
In January 2016, FMCSA’s final rule related to driver coercion took effect. Under this rule, carriers, shippers, receivers, or transportation intermediaries that are found to have coerced drivers to violate certain FMCSA regulations (including HOS rules) may be fined up to $16,000 for each offense.
In December 2016, FMCSA and DOT published the Commercial Driver’s License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse 

11
​



rule as mandated by the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act. The rule establishes and mandates a query to the Clearinghouse by employers and prospective employers to determine if current or prospective drivers have had any drug/alcohol positives or refusals. The rule went into effect in January 2017 and mandates compliance by January 2020 to allow time for the design and implementation of the clearinghouse IT systems. This system has now been implemented and the Company is in compliance with all query requirements. The Company anticipates that compliance with this system may decrease driver availability for both the industry as a whole, and our Company, specifically.
Other rules have been recently proposed or made final by FMCSA, including (i) a rule imposing a lifetime ban on driving commercial trucks for those who commit certain severe human trafficking offenses, (ii) a rule requiring the use of speed limiting devices on heavy duty tractors to restrict maximum speeds, which was proposed in 2016, and (iii) a rule setting forth minimum driver training standards for new drivers applying for commercial driver’s licenses for the first time and to experienced drivers upgrading their licenses or seeking a hazardous materials endorsement, which was made final in December 2016, with a compliance date in February 2020. In July 2017, the DOT announced that it would no longer pursue a speed limiter rule, but left open the possibility that it could resume such a pursuit in the future. The effect of these rules, to the extent they become effective, could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect the Company’s business or operations.
The use of independent contractors in the trucking industry has been challenged by tax and other regulatory authorities and has been the subject of class action lawsuits brought by current and former independent contractors who work, or have worked, in the industry. In general, the regulatory efforts and litigation center around the view that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. In some cases the targeted companies have used a lease-purchase independent contractor agreement, which may make a company more susceptible to the claims. The regulatory efforts have occurred on the state and in some cases on a federal level. The factors that determine independent contractor versus employee status vary depending on the jurisdiction and the particular statute or law involved. The regulatory effort and litigation include efforts to treat the independent contractors of trucking companies, such as ours, as employees for purposes of workers’ compensation, unemployment compensation, income taxes, minimum wage and overtime claims, expense reimbursement, meal and rest periods, employee benefits (health care, retirement, and other benefits), and other employment-related claims. This issue may also arise in some tort cases. In some cases, claimants have been successful in securing large settlements or have prevailed in their claims that the independent contractors are employees.
Federal legislators continue to introduce legislation concerning the classification of independent contractors as employees, including legislation that proposes to increase the tax and labor penalties against employers who intentionally or unintentionally misclassify employees as independent contractors and are found to have violated employee overtime or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to (i) abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice, (ii) extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to independent contractors, and (iii) impose notice requirements based upon employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply.
Some states have adopted initiatives to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers’ compensation, and income taxes, and the Company believes a reclassification of independent contractor drivers as employees would help states with this initiative. For example, in September 2019, California signed a bill into law that, as of January 2020, requires us to classify many of our independently contracted drivers as employees and treat them accordingly. This state law is being challenged in the federal courts by the California Trucking Association and the industry is actively lobbying the California legislature for an exemption. However, recently issued opinions from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division and the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) are consistent with the Company’s current treatment of its workforce.
If the independent contractors the Company engages were determined to be its employees, it would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, which could potentially include prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. The Company currently observes and monitors its compliance with current related and applicable laws and regulations, but it cannot predict whether it will be the subject of regulatory efforts or litigation challenging the independent contractor status of its workforce. The Company cannot predict laws and regulations adopted in the future regarding the classification

of the independent contractor drivers it engages or the impact on the Company’s business or operations. 
The regulatory environment has changed under the administration of President Trump. In January 2017, the President signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to repeal two regulations for each new one they propose and imposing a regulatory budget, which would limit the amount of new regulatory costs federal agencies can impose on individuals and businesses each year. The Company does not believe the order has had a significant impact on its industry. However, the order, and other anti-regulatory action by the President and/or Congress, may inhibit future new regulations and/or lead to the repeal or delayed effectiveness of existing regulations. Therefore, it is uncertain how the Company may be impacted in the future by existing, proposed, or repealed regulations. 
For further discussion regarding such laws and regulations, refer to the “Risk Factors” section under Part 1, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Seasonality
In the trucking industry, revenue has historically followed a seasonal pattern for various commodities and customer businesses. While peak freight demand has historically occurred in the months of September, October and November, no assurance can be provided that our current year experience will reflect this. After the December holiday season and during the remaining winter months, freight volumes are typically lower as many customers reduce shipment levels. Operating expenses have historically been higher in the winter months due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency, increased cold weather-related maintenance costs of revenue equipment and increased insurance and claims costs attributed to adverse winter weather conditions. Revenue can also be impacted by weather, holidays and the number of business days that occur during a given period, as revenue is directly related to the available working days of shippers.
