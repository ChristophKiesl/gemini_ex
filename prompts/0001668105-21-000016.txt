Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Talend is a leader in data integration and data integrity. We operate on the principle that delivering clean, complete, uncompromised, and trusted data — in real time — empowers businesses to make critical decisions with confidence. Our mission is to make data useful for all users by delivering trusted data when and where it is needed. Our customers rely on our software to better understand their customers, offer new applications and services, and improve operations. 
Digital transformation has gone from an opportunity to a necessity. Companies are re-platforming rapidly in the cloud with a priority on becoming data driven. Data is at the core of digital transformation. It is the key to unlocking corporate agility and navigating change with confidence and certainty. Yet, today, trust and quality issues prevent companies from providing holistic data intelligence – access to the right data by the right people at the right time. International Data Corporation (IDC) reports that users spend only 12% of their time on analyzing data, with the remaining 88% of time spent on preparation, data search and governance activities. We help organizations overcome the barriers that stand in the way of harnessing data and turn their data into a strategic asset that powers their business and unlocks value. We enable them to discover data across systems, aggregate it to power analytics, clean it to correct errors, transform it efficiently and effectively, share it across internal and external stakeholders, and govern it holistically. We introduced the Talend Trust Score™, which provides an at-a-glance, quantifiable measure of the reliability of any dataset. Our unified platform, Talend Data Fabric, puts trust and usability at the center of every data transaction.
Talend Data Fabric consists of a suite of applications that enables users to collect, transform, govern, and share data. It allows organizations to use data to make better strategic decisions, enhance customer experience and drive long-term business value. We provide Talend Data Fabric as a cloud solution or a term-based deployed license. Our platform supports connecting and processing data across on-premise, hybrid and multi-cloud environments – managed from a central location.
We are a recognized leader in the markets in which we operate. In 2020, Gartner identified Talend as a Leader in its Magic Quadrant for Data Integration Tools for the fifth consecutive year and in its Magic Quadrant for Data Quality Tools for the third time in a row.
Our platform addresses the markets for Data Integration and Integrity Software, Applied Master Data Management, and Integration and Orchestration Middleware, which IDC forecasts will grow from $18.5 billion in 2020 to $28.2 billion in 2023. Specifically, IDC forecasts the data integration and integrity software market to grow from $7.7 billion in 2020 to $10.6 billion in 2023. In addition, according to IDC, the market for Cloud Data Integration and Integrity Software is forecast to reach $2.8 billion by 2023, representing a 28% compound annual growth rate from 2020. This significant growth rate represents the rapid expansion and pace of change in the markets underlying our opportunity.
This market growth is coupled with an era of unprecedented innovation and technological change. The volume of data that organizations can harness is exploding. Organizations are increasingly adopting digital transformation strategies to leverage their data and are seeking to empower a wider scope of knowledge workers to become mainstream data consumers. Simultaneously, organizations are navigating rapid changes in the applications and systems supporting digital transformations. That has all resulted in a shift from a focus by organizations on building better tools to manage, move, and store data more effectively, to a focus on optimizing the strategic role of data in such areas as powering innovation, creative problem-solving, forging stronger customer relationships, and informing business strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated these trends that were already underway.
Key trends shaping our industry include:
•The rise of the cloud data platforms is being fueled by the desire of organizations to increase agility, cut operating costs, and achieve scalability. Even traditionally on-premise workloads such as big data and data warehouses are increasingly taking advantage of cloud or hybrid IT infrastructures as cloud becomes the new center of gravity for data. In conjunction with the transition to the cloud, organizations are experiencing an explosion of digital data, which can be leveraged for valuable insights such as business and performance metrics, customer attributes and behavior, and product strengths and capabilities.
•Digital strategies are becoming central to business success as organizations seek to harness their data to make strategic business decisions, manage customer relations, automate processes, improve operational efficiency, deliver engaging and personalized customer experiences, predict customer behavior, and anticipate new market trends. We believe organizations everywhere are seeking ways to gain competitive advantages by collecting, governing, transforming, and sharing their data. 
•Modular software is on the rise, in response to demands to move at scale with best-in-class applications, perform real-time analytics, and take advantage of internet-of-things (“IoT”) sensor data and machine learning. Consequently, organizations face a constantly evolving technology stack resulting in more complex and costly manual integration efforts.
•Software-based integration solutions are replacing the time-consuming and expensive process of manual integrations, driven by a desire to reduce costs and a scarcity of personnel with the requisite technical skills.
•Data governance will be required as new data privacy laws and regulations force companies to better account for how they manage data and regulatory risk, and keep up with business needs, technological change, and consumer expectations.
•The demand for self-service technology is increasing with the proliferation of data and its growing strategic importance. This is leading to a new wave of tools that allow both IT and business users to collect, govern, transform, and share data more quickly than before to empower knowledge workers in all roles and functions in an organization to become data consumers.
The sheer volume and complexity of data resulting from these trends will require more powerful and flexible solutions to meet the needs of companies in every industry. The need for trusted data to deliver greater insight is paramount in this increasingly chaotic environment. It is critical for organizations to have a technology strategy that takes advantage of data to support their business initiatives. To do this, IT teams must be able to work with new data platforms and fluidly address high volume, IoT, self-service, and real-time scenarios.

We have an open source core app that anyone can download, improve, enrich, or extend, and we are very engaged with the open source community to get feedback to improve our applications. In addition to our own in-house developed open source projects, we employ open source committers to key shared projects from the Apache Software Foundation such as Apache Beam, ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF, Apache Karaf, and Syncope that are used in our own technology stack but also in many other enterprise software applications.
Human Capital
We are dedicated to making data useful for all organizations to change the way the world makes decisions by taking the work out of working with data. As a software company, our employees are a significant asset and are critical to achieving our mission and satisfying the needs of our customers. To compete and succeed in our highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, it is crucial that we attract, retain, and motivate skilled and experienced employees.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,397 employees. We have a globally distributed workforce. Our employees are located in over 15 countries with 39% in our North America region, 44% in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and 17% in our Asia Pacific region. We believe our globally distributed workforce and our employees’ prior experience working virtually with colleagues around the globe has been an advantage as we have adopted to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe a diverse and inclusive environment drives innovation, performance, and creativity, and is integral to our efforts to attract and retain key talent. Approximately 70% of our workforce is male and 30% is female. Our senior leadership team is 63% female and 37% male, and four of the eight members of our board of directors are female. Moreover, we are committed to achieving pay equity within our organization. In 2018 we began conducting an annual review of pay equity. Our analysis for 2020 shows that women earn 96 cents for every dollar earned by men in a comparable position, an improvement from 91 cents per dollar for 2019. We intend to continue to focus our efforts on achieving pay equity across our organization.
Compensation and Benefits
We seek to design our compensation program to attract, retain, and motivate talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, ensure the success of our customers, and create long-term value for shareholders. We use a combination of fixed and variable pay including base salary, bonuses or commissions, and stock-based compensation. We offer employee benefits that vary by country and are designed to be competitive in the marketplace. In the United States, for example, we offer a 401(k) plan with employer matching contributions; an employee stock purchase program; health benefits; life, business travel and disability insurance; paid time off and parental leave; paid counseling assistance; and mental health and wellness benefits, including the Headspace for Work app. Moreover, to address the added stress imposed on employees by the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented several initiatives to provide additional support to employees, including a global day off, and a one-time reimbursement for all employees for home office equipment.
Engagement and Retention
As part of our dedication to and investment in employees, we conduct regular employee engagement surveys. The surveys conducted in fiscal 2020 focused on a variety of different areas, including employee satisfaction, inclusion, work life balance, and collaboration. In our fourth quarter 2020 survey, our score improved year-over-year and compared favorably to the benchmark score of our software peers.
We closely monitor hiring and retention globally. During 2020, we added 178 net employees, achieving record hiring and higher retention than our historical averages.
Competition
The market for our applications is highly competitive, quickly evolving and subject to rapid changes in technology, which may expand the alternatives available to our customers for their data integration and integrity requirements. Our current primary competitors generally fall into six categories:
•Diversified technology companies that offer data integration solutions, including: IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP;
•Pure-play data integration vendors, including: Ab Initio, Informatica and Tibco;
•Cloud data warehouse providers such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Snowflake, which offer some integration tools and capabilities;
•Vendors from other related markets (for example, SnapLogic, a traditional integration platform as a service vendor, and Salesforce MuleSoft and Dell Boomi, API providers) entering into the data integration and integrity market;
•Early-stage, cloud native, niche data integration technologies, including Fivetran and Matillion; and
•Hand-coded, custom data integration solutions built internally by potential and existing customers.
We believe that we are well-positioned in the marketplace relative to our competitors. We are differentiated from traditional vendors by our advanced technology and rapid innovation, both of which are driven by our open source roots, and we believe emerging niche vendors cannot match the scale of our app breadth or go-to-market capabilities. Unlike other primary competitors, through our cloud offerings and our Stitch Data Loader solution, we believe we are uniquely positioned to serve companies of all sizes and use cases that span enterprise-wide initiatives as well as unique line-of-business needs.
We expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the data integration software market, as customers’ requirements evolve, and as new products and technologies are introduced. We believe that the principal factors that drive our competitive edge in our market include:
•Application features, architecture reliability, scalability, performance and effectiveness;
•Unified platform that caters to the needs of both business users and data specialists;
•Name and reputation of the vendor or competitive offering;
•Vision for the market and application roadmap, as well as pace of innovation;
•Serverless capabilities and interoperability with numerous cloud and big data solutions vendors;
•Breadth of connectivity with leading cloud and on-premise systems;
•Automation and continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) capabilities;
•Strategic partnerships with major enterprise software and infrastructure providers;
•Status as a neutral, independent software vendor;
•Performance in hybrid, multi-cloud environments;
•Support for all enterprise integration scenarios, including data integration, event integration, and application integration;
•Demonstrated return on investment through time-to-value and total cost of ownership; and
•Ease-of-use and efficiency during development and deployment.
Many of our existing competitors, however, have and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition and longer operating histories, larger sales and marketing budgets and resources, broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and customers, greater customer support resources, greater resources to make acquisitions, lower labor and development costs, larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios, and substantially greater financial, technical and other resources.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, patents, contractual restrictions and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We generally require our employees and consultants to execute invention assignment agreements with us that protect our intellectual property rights.
Intellectual property laws, together with our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. The laws of 
certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of France and the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology. Further, agreements with our employees and consultants may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies to redress any breach. Further, to the extent that our employees or consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
As of December 31, 2020, we had two issued patents and one pending patent application in the United States. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire in 2036 and 2037. While we have applied for patent protection for some of our intellectual property, we do not believe we are materially dependent on the issued patents or pending patent application to protect our offerings and we believe the duration of our intellectual property rights are adequate. We may pursue additional patent protection in the future to the extent it would be beneficial to us and cost-effective. We also own and use registered and unregistered trademarks on or in connection with our applications and services in numerous jurisdictions. In addition, we have also registered numerous internet domain names.
Government Regulation
We are a global company subject to numerous and complex laws and regulations in the United States, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, and other jurisdictions in which we operate and do business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data security, data protection, intellectual property, competition, taxation, export controls, employment, and anti-corruption, among other subjects. For example, we are subject to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom's Bribery Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the United States, among other regulatory regimes. Many of the laws and regulations that we are subject to are continuously and rapidly evolving and developing, and are subject to interpretation by courts, regulators, and enforcement authorities. As a result, the application to and impact on us of many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject is uncertain. For a discussion of the risks related to these various areas of government regulation, see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Regulation of our Business."

The effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.
In December 2019, COVID-19 was reported in China, in January 2020 the WHO declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and in March 2020 the WHO declared it a pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak has continued to spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. 
In light of the rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of COVID-19 and relevant government orders, we have taken measures intended to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate, which could negatively impact our business. We are generally requiring all employees around the globe to work remotely. We continue to monitor and safeguard our systems, networks and data; however, the unprecedented scale of remote work may require additional personnel and resources, which nevertheless cannot be guaranteed to fully safeguard all systems, networks, and data upon which we rely. We also have suspended all non-essential travel worldwide for our employees. While we have a distributed workforce and our employees are accustomed to working remotely or working with other remote employees, our workforce is not fully remote. Our employees travel frequently to establish and maintain relationships with one another, our customers and prospective customers, partners, and investors. In addition, we hold in-person marketing events to generate sales leads for our products, and restrictions on in-person gatherings have affected our marketing efforts by limiting them to virtual events and digital channels, which may not prove as effective at building sales leads. Further, some projects to assist our customers to implement our software also require presence at the customer’s site and, as a result, some implementation projects have been and others in the future may be delayed. In addition, current social distancing measures could: negatively affect our sales efforts and our ability to enter into customer contracts in a timely manner; slow down our recruiting efforts; challenge our ability to effectively onboard new hires; or create operational or other challenges. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and results of operations. We continue to monitor the situation and will adjust our current policies as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves and public health and other government officials issue additional guidance or orders.
In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to disrupt the operations of certain of our customers, channel partners, resellers and systems integrators for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of travel restrictions and/or business shutdowns, uncertainty in the financial markets or other harm to their business and financial results, resulting in delayed purchase decisions, extended payment terms, and postponed or canceled projects. More generally, the COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting economies globally. The impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the broader global economy have been swift, dramatic and unpredictable. The latency and duration of these impacts are diverse across geographies and jurisdictions in which we market and sell our solutions. We have had some planned purchases of our solutions delayed or canceled because of current economic conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic conditions could reduce demand for our solutions in the future. We or our customers may also experience increased costs associated with security of our infrastructure and data, as the increase in remote work has also increased the surface area potentially vulnerable to cyberattack. As a result of the foregoing factors, the current COVID-19 pandemic and economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our solutions and may harm our business and results of operations.
It is not currently possible to estimate with any reasonable certainty the precise impact that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, such as the duration and spread of the pandemic, the extent and effectiveness of containment and vaccination efforts, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners, and vendors.
Prolonged economic uncertainties or downturns, including from the COVID-19 pandemic could harm our business.
Current or future economic downturns, fear or anticipation of such conditions, or uncertainty as to how the U.S. or foreign governments will act with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, tariffs, and international trade agreements and policies, could harm our business and results of operations, cause a decrease in corporate spending on enterprise software in general and slow down the rate of growth of our business. In addition, financial and credit market fluctuations, the impact and uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, changes in interest rates and inflation, changes in international trade relationships and trade disputes between the U.S. and other countries, instability in the geopolitical environment as a result of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom “Brexit” from the European Union, economic challenges in China, and terrorist attacks in the United States, Europe or elsewhere, individually or collectively, could negatively affect the U.S. and global macroeconomic environment. A prolonged period of economic uncertainty or a downturn may also significantly affect financing markets including the availability of capital and the terms, cost and conditions of financing arrangements, including the overall cost of financing. Circumstances may arise in which we need, or desire, to raise additional capital, and such capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
Currently, the U.S. and global macroeconomic environment is being negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current worldwide economic conditions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic have made it challenging for our customers and us to forecast and plan future business activities accurately and has caused and could continue to cause customers to reevaluate their decision to purchase our products, which could delay and lengthen our sales cycles or result in cancellations of planned purchases. In fact, some prospective customers have delayed or canceled planned purchases of our products and some existing customers have reduced or have not renewed contracts in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and current economic conditions. We believe that the current global macroeconomic conditions have resulted in slower revenue growth across our business as a result of fewer purchases by new customers, and decisions by customers not to increase, to decrease, or even end of their contracts with us when their contracts are up for renewal. Furthermore, during these challenging economic times our customers may face issues in managing working capital or gaining access to sufficient credit, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, we may be required to, among other things, increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, grant payment concessions or modify payment terms, which would harm our results of operations. For example, in March 2020 we saw an increase in the days outstanding of our accounts receivables related to requests from certain customers for extended payment terms and flexibility, though these trends have since stabilized and improved. We have a significant number of customers in industries highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the travel and hospitality, retail, and energy industries. Current macroeconomic conditions have caused and may cause firms in certain of these and any other impacted industries to react by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their spending on information technology. Customers in industries affected by current macroeconomic conditions may delay or cancel information technology projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts. To the extent purchases of our offerings are perceived by customers and potential customers to be discretionary, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general information technology spending. Also, subscription customers may choose to develop or utilize in-house support capabilities as an alternative to purchasing our subscription offerings. Moreover, competitors have responded and may continue to respond to market conditions by lowering prices of subscription offerings. In addition, the increased pace of consolidation in certain industries may result in reduced overall spending on our subscription offerings.
We cannot predict the timing, depth or duration of the current economic slowdown, generally or within any particular geographic region or industry. If the economic conditions of the general economy or industries in which we operate remain subdued or worsen from present levels, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
We have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve profitability or positive cash flows on a consistent basis. If we cannot achieve profitability or positive cash flows, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
We have incurred losses in all years since our inception. We incurred a net loss of $79.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, $61.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and $39.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. As a result, we had accumulated losses of $358.1 million as of December 31, 2020. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop our technology, enhance our product and service offerings, broaden our installed customer base, expand our sales channels and our operations, and hire additional employees. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently, or at all, to offset these higher expenses. Revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons, including slowing demand for our products or services, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, failure to 
acquire or renew subscriptions with customers, particularly large enterprise customers, a failure to capitalize on growth opportunities or the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic conditions on IT spending. In fact, our revenue growth rate has slowed over the past several years due to demand headwinds for term-based deployed licenses and our professional services offerings, as well as macroeconomic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Any failure to sufficiently increase our revenue could prevent us from achieving profitability or improving cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to meet these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
If we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected.
While we have historically experienced significant revenue growth, we may not achieve similar revenue growth in future periods or at all. Our employee headcount and number of customers have increased significantly and over time we expect to continue to grow our headcount. The evolution of our business and product offerings places a continuous significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. As we have grown, we have managed more complex deployments of our subscriptions with large enterprise customers, and part of our growth strategy is to increase sales to these customers. We must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, and our ability to manage headcount, capital and processes in an efficient manner to manage our growth to date and any future growth effectively. 
We may not be able to successfully scale improvements to our product offering or implement systems, processes and controls in an efficient or timely manner or in a manner that does not negatively affect our results of operations. In addition, our existing systems, processes and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions or fraud. We may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes and controls or in connection with third-party software, which could disrupt existing customer relationships, cause us to lose customers, limit us to smaller deployments of our products, or increase our technical support costs. Our failure to improve our systems, processes and controls, or their failure to operate in the intended manner, may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to forecast our revenue, forecast our expenses and earnings accurately, or to prevent certain losses. For example, we are implementing certain new enterprise software systems and enhancing existing software systems. Any failure to implement these systems may disrupt our operations and our operating expenses could increase. Additionally, our productivity and the quality of our products and services may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. Any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization. If we do not successfully manage the coordination of our internal teams, including our sales and marketing functions, we may experience reduced productivity of our employees and may be constrained in our ability to further grow and scale our business. Failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, negatively affect our customers’ satisfaction with our products and services and harm our results of operations.
Recent changes to our sales and marketing organizations and strategies may result in employee turnover, disruption to our sales activities and may adversely affect our operating results.
As part of our efforts to manage future growth and achieve greater efficiency we have made changes to our sales and marketing organizations and strategies. In particular, as of the beginning of 2021, we reorganized the structure and operations of our sales organization to center the organization around four distinct market segments: small business, mid-sized business, enterprise and strategic enterprise accounts. We also established dedicated teams to specifically drive new logo acquisition and client expansion. Although we believe the reorganization will improve our efficiency and performance, the reorganization may not have the intended effect and we may experience employee turnover, disruption to our sales activities, and the reorganization may adversely affect our operating results.
If we are unable to increase sales of our solution to new customers and sell additional products to our existing customers, our future revenue and results of operations will be harmed.
Our future success depends on our ability to sell our subscriptions to new customers and to expand the deployment of our platform with existing customers by selling additional subscriptions. As a result, we may be required to use increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts to differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors, which may not result in additional sales. In addition, the rate at which our customers purchase additional subscriptions depends on a number of factors, including the perceived need for additional data integration and integrity products, evolving sales strategies as well as general 
economic conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it more challenging to sell our subscriptions to new customers because curtailed travel and lack of in-person meetings make it more difficult to establish trusted business partner relationships, especially in certain cultures. Moreover, some industries particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel and hospitality, retail, and energy, have significantly cut or eliminated capital expenditures at this time. If we are unable to build new relationships with those verticals during the pandemic, that could harm our customer base later. Even if we are able to demonstrate the value of our solution to a potential customer, they may choose to adopt our competitors’ offerings instead for a variety of reasons, including familiarity, legacy implementation, and uncertainty surrounding change. If our efforts to sell additional subscriptions to our customers are not successful, our business may suffer.
The market for our cloud offerings is relatively new, unproven and evolving, and our future success depends on the growth and expansion of such market and our ability to adapt and respond effectively to an evolving market.
The market for cloud offerings is relatively new, rapidly evolving and unproven. Our future success will depend in large part on our cloud offerings' ability to penetrate the existing market for data integration and integrity platforms, as well as the continued growth and expansion of the market for data integration and integrity platforms. It is difficult to predict customer adoption and renewals, customers’ demand for our offerings, the size, growth rate and expansion of these markets, the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products. If we do not correctly anticipate changes in these markets or are unable to respond quickly and effectively to changes in these markets, our business may be harmed. Our ability to penetrate the existing market and any expansion of the market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with our offerings, as well as subscription customers’ willingness to adopt an alternative approach to data integration and integrity platforms. Additionally, demand for our cloud offerings will depend in large part on the adoption of cloud data warehouses. Furthermore, many potential subscription customers have made significant investments in hand coding or legacy ETL software and may be unwilling to invest in a new solution. If the market for cloud offerings fails to grow or decreases in size, or if we fail to adapt to any changes in the industry, our business would be harmed.
If we fail to successfully manage our business model transition to cloud offerings and a cloud-oriented sales model, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.
For a number of years there has been an industry transition to cloud technologies and a decrease in on-premise big data application adoption. In response to these trends we accelerated the development of our cloud offerings and shifted to a cloud-oriented sales model. During our business model transition, revenue, orders, gross margin, net income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, deferred revenue, and cash flow from operations will be impacted as revenue is recognized ratably rather than a portion up front. Further, our cloud customers typically demand fewer professional services from us compared to term-based deployed license customers, which has had, and we anticipate will continue to have, a negative impact on our professional services revenue.
Our transition may give rise to a number of risks and uncertainties, and if we do not successfully navigate and execute this transition, our business and future operating results could be adversely affected. Continued development of existing cloud offerings as well as new cloud offerings requires a considerable investment of technical, financial, legal, and sales resources, and a scalable organization. Market acceptance of such offerings is affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to: security, reliability, performance, current license terms, customer preference, the timing of customers' digital transformation, social/community engagement, customer concerns with entrusting a third-party to store and manage their data, public concerns regarding privacy, data security, and data protection and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations. Whether our business model transition will prove successful and will accomplish our business and financial objectives is subject to numerous uncertainties, including but not limited to: customer demand, attach and renewal rates, channel acceptance, our ability to further develop and scale infrastructure, our ability to include functionality and usability in such offerings that address customer requirements, competitive offerings, particularly from low-end cloud competition, tax and accounting implications, pricing, and our costs. Even if we successfully implement this transition, new customers and existing customers may not purchase subscriptions for our new or redeveloped cloud offerings.
Moreover, if our sales model is not successful, or if new sales models we adopt are not successful, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected. In addition, any failure of our management and sales personnel to develop and implement sales strategies for our new product offerings could harm our ability to successfully introduce new products.
If we are not successful in increasing sales of our solutions to new and existing large enterprise customers, our operating results may suffer.
Our growth strategy is multifaceted and includes increasing sales of our solution to new and existing large enterprise customers. Sales to these large enterprise customers involve risks that may not be present (or that are present to a lesser extent) with sales to smaller customers. These risks include:
•Competition from companies that traditionally target larger enterprises and that may have pre-existing relationships or purchase commitments from such customers;
•Increased purchasing power and leverage held by large enterprise customers in negotiating contractual arrangements with us;
•More stringent requirements in our support services, including demand for quicker support response times and penalties for any failure to meet support requirements; and
•Longer sales cycles and the associated risk that substantial time and resources may be spent on a potential customer that elects not to purchase our solutions.
Large organizations often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle. Although we rely on our channel partners for a portion of our sales, our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with our prospective customers as well as our distributors and resellers. We typically provide evaluation products to these customers and may spend substantial time, effort and money in our sales efforts to these prospective customers. In addition, product purchases by large organizations are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other delays. Finally, large organizations typically have longer implementation cycles, require greater product functionality and scalability, require a broader range of services, demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks, require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect greater payment flexibility. All of these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers.
Our business historically has been substantially dependent on sales leads from in-person marketing events and digital marketing efforts, and if we are unable to successfully shift to digital demand generation activities that generate significant volumes of such leads, our results of operations and operating cash flow may be adversely affected.
We have traditionally utilized in-person marketing events to educate potential customers about our solutions and generate sales leads. In light of social distancing measures implemented to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been unable to hold in-person marketing events and attend trade shows and instead have had to rely on virtual-only events. We have adapted and redesigned traditional demand generation activities to meet the new restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we did not have a history of utilizing virtual-only events to such a large extent and are still learning the most effective practices and adjusting accordingly. As a result, our virtual-only events have not been and may continue not to be as successful in creating an interest in our solutions or generating sales leads as our in-person events and our marketing team will need to continue to make adjustments as it adapts. If our virtual-only marketing efforts are not as successful as our in-person marketing events, then our results of operations and operating cash flow could be adversely affected.
We also utilize digital marketing channels, such as paid and free online search, display advertising, email and social media, in order to direct potential customers interested in our solution to our websites and generate sales leads. Many of these potential customers find our websites by searching for data integration solutions through Internet search engines, particularly Google. A critical factor in attracting potential customers to our websites is how prominently our websites are displayed in response to search inquiries. If we are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search result listings for any reason, visits to our websites by customers and potential customers could decline significantly and we may not be able to replace this traffic. Furthermore, if the costs associated with our digital marketing channels increase, we may be required to increase our sales and marketing expenses, which may not be offset by additional revenue, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Recent significant changes to our leadership team and the resulting management transitions and organizational changes might harm our future operating results.
We have recently experienced significant changes to our leadership team. In January 2020, Christal Bemont was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer. At the same time, we announced the hiring of Ann-Christel Graham as our Chief Revenue Officer, or CRO, and we also announced the creation of a new Chief Customer Officer position, or CCO, which was filled by Jamie Kiser. In October 2020, Ms. Kiser was named our Chief Operating Officer, in addition to her position as CCO, and Krishna Tammana joined as our Chief Technology Officer, or CTO. Although we believe these leadership changes are in the best interest of our stakeholders, these changes have resulted in significant organizational changes, including to our sales and marketing organizations. The leadership transition and organizational changes have resulted and may in the future result in loss of personnel with deep institutional or technical knowledge and have the potential to disrupt our operations and relationships with employees and customers due to added costs, operational inefficiencies, decreased employee morale and productivity, and increased turnover. Moreover, to the extent we experience management turnover, competition for top management is high and it may take months to find a candidate that meets our requirements. If we are unable to mitigate these or other similar risks, our business, results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected.
We depend on a highly skilled workforce, our executive officers and members of our leadership team. An inability to retain and attract highly skilled employees or the loss of one or more of our executive officers or members of our leadership team could harm our business.
Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. The inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales, may seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In fact, we are substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing engineering personnel because of the complexity of our platform. Further, any failure to hire, train, retain and adequately incentivize our sales personnel could negatively affect our growth and the inability of our recently hired sales personnel to effectively ramp up to target productivity levels could negatively affect our operating margins.
Our employees do not have employment arrangements that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period. They can terminate their employment with us at any time. Additionally, the industry in which we operate generally experiences high employee attrition. We believe several factors may negatively impact our attrition rate in 2021, including the implementation of certain internal strategic changes, and an increase in employees' willingness to change jobs if the COVID-19 pandemic is controlled or eradicated through ongoing vaccination efforts. We are also subject to restrictions under French law with respect to the number of restricted share units we may have outstanding relative to our share capital, as well as minimum vesting and holding period requirements for our restricted share units. These limitations have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to offer competitive equity compensation to both current and prospective employees.
Our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our executives and members of our leadership team to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. Although we have entered into employment offer letters with our executive officers and the members of our leadership team, these agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or members of our leadership team could seriously harm our business and results of operations, reduce employee retention, disrupt our relationships with our employees, customers and vendors, and impair our ability to compete.
Competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, the United Kingdom and France, where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel. To the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited, that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product. In addition, we have experienced difficulty, and in the future may not be successful, in attracting or integrating qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. We intend to be disciplined with headcount growth in 2021 to seek to improve operating efficiency. If we incorrectly assess the capabilities of our current workforce, this approach to new headcount could put a strain on our existing workforce and result in increased attrition, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy. Moreover, if we fail to fill positions essential to executing and achieving our strategic plans and objectives, whether because of our restrained hiring plans or an inability to recruit and attract talent, we may fail to execute and achieve them, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. Temporary office closures and travel restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could make it more difficult to onboard new employees, provide trainings and integrate them into our workforce, which could adversely affect the productivity of our employees and our business.
Interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure, such as security incidents, and our reliance on technologies from third parties, may adversely affect our business operations and financial results.
Our website and internal technology infrastructure may experience performance issues due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website or third-party hosting disruptions or capacity constraints due to a number of potential causes, including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security incidents, such as ransomware attacks. Our use and distribution of open source software and remote work arrangements may increase this risk. If our website is unavailable, our users are unable to use our products or download our tools, we fail to satisfy contractual obligations guaranteeing minimum availability rates, or users or prospective users are unable to order subscription offerings or professional services within a reasonable amount of time or at all, our business could be harmed. 
Further, we expect to continue to make significant investments to enable rapid releases of new features and applications for Talend Data Fabric and maintain our cloud infrastructure. To the extent that we do not effectively upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and results of operations may be harmed.
In addition, we rely on cloud technologies from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including financial management services, relationship management services and lead generation management services. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or prices, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage our finances could be interrupted, our processes for managing sales of our subscription offerings and professional services and supporting our customers could be impaired, and our ability to generate and manage sales leads could be weakened until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained and implemented, all of which could harm our business and results of operations.
Our sales cycle can be long and variable, particularly with respect to sales through our channel partners or sales to large enterprise customers, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense.
Our results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the resource-intensive nature of our sales efforts, the length and variability of the sales cycle of our subscription offerings and the difficulty in making short-term adjustments to our operating expenses. The length of our sales cycle, from initial contact with our sales team to contractually committing to our subscription offerings, can vary substantially from customer to customer based on deal complexity as well as whether a sale is made directly by us or through a channel partner. Particularly for larger enterprise customers, the sales cycle can be longer and require additional resources as these customers may undertake an evaluation process and we may spend substantial time, effort and money in these sales efforts. Additionally, product purchases by larger organizations are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other delays. Larger enterprise customers may also have longer implementation cycles and require greater product functionality or support. It is difficult to predict exactly when, or even if, we will make a sale to a potential customer or if we can increase sales to our existing customers. As a result, large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. In fact, as a result of current economic conditions, some expected sales have delayed or canceled as potential customers reevaluate their IT spending budgets or implement additional approval processes. In the future, we may experience delays and cancellations as a result of any current or future recession. The loss or delay of one or more large transactions in a quarter could affect our cash flows and results of operations for that quarter and our revenue for any future quarters. Because a substantial proportion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, our results of operations will suffer if we are unable to convert large enterprise customers and our revenue falls below our expectations in a particular quarter, which could cause the price of our ADSs and ordinary shares to decline.
We rely significantly on revenue from subscriptions, which may decline over time. Because we recognize a significant portion of revenue from subscriptions over the term of the relevant subscription period, downturns or upturns in sales trends are not reflected in full in our current results of operations.
Subscription revenue accounts for a significant portion of our revenue, comprising 90% of total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020, 88% in the year ended December 31, 2019 and 86% in the year ended December 31, 2018. We have experienced fluctuations in our renewal rates, particularly with respect to our cloud offerings. Sales of new or renewal subscription contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers’ level of satisfaction with our products, the prices of our products, the prices of products affected by our competitors and reductions in our customers’ 
spending levels, including as a result of COVID-19 pandemic induced economic weakness. If our sales of new or renewal subscription contracts decline, our total revenue and revenue growth rate may decline and our business will suffer. 
Under ASC 606, the revenue recognition standard adopted by us on January 1, 2018, the support and maintenance element of term-based deployed license arrangements represents a series of performance obligations that are delivered over time and are recognized ratably over time. Our term-based deployed licenses are also comprised of a separate performance obligation related to the software license element of the subscription, which is a much smaller portion of the subscription arrangement. We allocate a portion of the transaction price of a term-based deployed license to the software license performance obligation and the remainder of the transaction price to the support and maintenance performance obligation (See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies -- Revenue recognition, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 in this Annual Report). Subscriptions for our cloud offerings represent the right of access to our software as a service for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Subscription agreements typically have a contractual term of one to three years and are generally billed annually in advance and non-cancelable.
As a result, a significant portion of the subscription revenue we report each quarter continues to be recognition of deferred revenue from subscription contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscription contracts in any one fiscal quarter will not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue in that fiscal quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our subscriptions is not reflected in full in our results of operations until future periods. Also, it is difficult for us to increase our subscription revenue rapidly through additional sales in any period, as the vast majority of revenue from new and renewal subscription contracts must be recognized ratably over the applicable period.
If our existing customers terminate, do not renew their subscriptions, or reduce their spending with us, it could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
We expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewals of existing subscription agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the majority of our subscription revenues were derived from the renewals of existing subscription agreements. As a result, achieving a high renewal rate of our subscription agreements is critical to our business. Our existing customers that purchase our subscription services have no contractual obligation to renew their contracts after the completion of their initial subscription term, which is typically one year, and some customers may have a right to terminate during the subscription term. As a result, we may not accurately predict future revenue from existing customers. Our customers’ renewal rates have in the past, and may in the future, decline or fluctuate, and termination rates may increase or fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, including their satisfaction with our platform and our customer support, our products’ ability to integrate with new and changing technologies, the frequency and severity of subscription outages, the capabilities of competing products, the introduction of competing technologies, our product uptime or latency, the pricing of our or competing products, and changes in IT budgets and macroeconomic conditions, including the current economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, if we experience difficulties assisting customers with the successful implementation of new projects, including as a result of COVID-19 social distancing measures, our renewal rates may be adversely affected. In addition, any prolonged shutdown of a significant portion of global economic activity or a downturn in the global economy, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, would adversely affect the industries in which our customers operate, which could adversely affect our customers’ willingness or ability to renew their subscription agreements. Even if our customers renew their subscriptions, they may renew for lower subscription amounts or for shorter subscription terms or on other terms that are less economically beneficial to us. If our customers terminate or do not renew their subscriptions, or renew on less favorable terms, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our dollar-based net expansion rate, a key metric we use to track the growth of our business, may grow more slowly than expected or decline.
Our future success depends in large part on the growth of the market for cloud data management and an increase in the desire to ingest, store and process data in the cloud, and the market for cloud data warehouses and applications may not grow as expected and, even if such growth occurs, our business may not grow at similar rates, or at all.
Our ability to increase the adoption of our cloud integration solutions, sales of related support subscriptions, and professional services depends on the increased adoption of big data services and applications by enterprises. While we believe that cloud data management, including data warehouses and integration solutions, can offer a compelling value proposition to many enterprises, its broad adoption presents challenges to enterprises, including developing the internal expertise and infrastructure to manage these solutions effectively, coordinating multiple data sources, and implementing the necessary security and controls to become comfortable with storing and accessing critical data in the cloud. Accordingly, our expectations regarding the potential for 
future growth in the market for big data applications and services, and the third-party growth estimates for this market are subject to significant uncertainty. If the overall market for cloud data management does not grow as expected, our business prospects may be adversely affected. Even if the market for cloud data management and services increases, our business may not grow at a similar rate, or at all.
We derived a substantial portion of our subscription revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020 from our term-based deployed Talend Big Data Integration offering and our cloud offerings and failure of these offerings to satisfy customer demands or to achieve increased market acceptance would harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.
We derived a substantial portion of our subscription revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020 and expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our subscription revenue from our term-based deployed Talend Big Data Integration offering and our cloud offerings. Demand for these offerings is affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including market acceptance of our solutions by referenceable accounts for existing and new use cases, the timing of development and release of new products by our competitors and additional capabilities and functionality by us, and technological change and growth or contraction in the market in which we compete, including the adoption of big data technologies. We expect the proliferation of data to lead to an increase in the IT integration needs of our customers, and our term-based deployed Talend Big Data Integration offering and our cloud offerings may not be able to perform to meet those demands. If we are unable to continue to meet our subscription customer requirements, achieve more widespread market acceptance of such offerings, or increase demand for these offerings, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects will be harmed.
Incorrect implementation or use of our software could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our business, operations, financial results and growth prospects.
Our platform is designed to be operated in a self-service manner by our customers who subscribe to our cloud solution and our platform may also be deployed on-premise in large scale, complex IT environments of our customers. Our customers and channel partners require training and experience in the proper use of and the variety of benefits that can be derived from our platform to maximize its benefit for their business. If our platform is not implemented or used correctly or as intended, inadequate performance or security vulnerabilities may result. The incorrect implementation or use of our software or our failure to train customers on how to use our software productively may result in customer dissatisfaction, negative publicity and may adversely affect our reputation and brand. Failure by us to provide these training and implementation services to our customers would result in lost opportunities for follow-on sales to these customers and adoption of our platform by new customers and adversely affect our business and growth prospects. Further, we have in the past, and may in the future, experience reduced demand for our professional services. If we are not able to sell professional services to our customers, their ability to successfully implement our software may be harmed, which could result in customer dissatisfaction with our products, negatively impact renewal or expansion rates, harm our brand, and adversely affect our results of operations.
In cases where our platform has been deployed on-premise within a customer’s IT environment, if we or our customers are unable to configure or implement our software properly, or are unable to do so in a timely manner, customer perceptions of our platform may be impaired, our reputation and brand may suffer, and customers may choose not to increase their use of our platform or to discontinue its use. In addition, our term-based deployed license solution imposes server load and data storage requirements for implementation. If our customers do not have the server load capacity or the storage capacity required, they may not be able to implement and use our platform effectively and, therefore, may choose to discontinue their use of our platform or not increase their use.
Our ability to increase sales of our solution is highly dependent on the quality of our customer support, and our failure to offer high-quality support would have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. 
After our products are deployed within our customers’ IT environments, our customers depend on our technical support services, as well as the support of our channel partners, including value added resellers, to resolve issues relating to our products. Our channel partners often provide similar technical support for third parties’ products and may therefore have fewer resources to dedicate to the support of our products. If we or our channel partners do not succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues or provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional subscriptions to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. The COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on travel and work-from-home orders could hinder our ability and the ability of our channel partners and systems integrators to provide adequate and timely support to our customers, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers 
and adversely affect our renewal rates. Many larger enterprise and government entity customers have more complex IT environments and require higher levels of support than smaller customers. If we or our channel partners fail to meet the requirements of these enterprise customers, it may be more difficult to grow sales with enterprise customers. 
Additionally, if our channel partners do not effectively provide support to the satisfaction of our customers, we may be required to provide direct support to such customers, which would require us to hire additional personnel and to invest in additional resources. It can take several months to recruit, hire and train qualified technical support employees. We may not be able to hire such resources fast enough to keep up with unexpected demand, particularly if the sales of our products exceed our internal forecasts. To the extent that we or our channel partners are unsuccessful in hiring, training and retaining adequate support resources, our and our channel partners’ ability to provide adequate and timely support to our customers, and our customers’ satisfaction with our products and services, will be adversely affected. Additionally, to the extent that we may need to rely on our sales engineers to provide post-sales support while we are ramping our support resources, our sales productivity will be negatively affected, which would harm our revenue. Our or our channel partners’ failure to provide and maintain high-quality support services would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we do not effectively expand and train our sales force, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers and our business will be adversely affected.
We continue to be substantially dependent on our sales force to obtain new customers and to drive additional usage and sales among our existing customers. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel, including enterprise sales representatives and sales engineers, with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. In particular, there is significant demand for sales engineers with data integration and cloud software expertise. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth. For example, attrition and changing sales team leadership have resulted and may continue to result in slower than expected growth in affected geographies. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity before we can continue to scale our sales efforts. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. In addition, as we continue to grow rapidly, a large percentage of our sales force will have relatively little experience working with us, our subscription offerings and our business model. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, or our sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business will be harmed.
We face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.
The market for our products is highly competitive, quickly evolving and subject to rapid changes in technology, which may expand the alternatives to our customers for their data integration and integrity requirements. Our current primary competitors generally fall into six categories:
•Diversified technology companies that offer data integration solutions, including: IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP;
•Pure-play data integration vendors, including: Ab Initio, Informatica and Tibco;
•Cloud data warehouse providers such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Snowflake, which offer some integration tools and services;
•Vendors from other related markets (for example, SnapLogic, a traditional integration platform as a service vendor, and Salesforce MuleSoft and Dell Boomi, API providers) entering into the data integration and integrity market;
•Early-stage, cloud native, niche data integration technologies, including Fivetran and Matillion; and
•Hand-coded, custom data integration solutions built internally by organizations that we target as potential customers.
Many of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as:
•Greater name recognition and longer operating histories;
•Larger sales and marketing budgets and resources;
•Broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and customers;
•Greater customer support resources;
•Greater resources to make acquisitions;
•Lower labor and development costs;
•Larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and
•Substantially greater financial, technical and other resources.
Certain of our current strategic partners, such as Cloudera, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Snowflake have developed or may develop and offer their own data integration solutions. Such competitors may be more likely to promote and sell their own solutions over our products and they may ultimately be able to transition customers onto their competing solutions, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and growth. Further, such competitors may cease their relationships with us. For example, we use the cloud hosting services provided by AWS and Microsoft Azure for our cloud offerings. While our customer contracts do not obligate us to use a particular cloud hosting service platform, if either AWS or Microsoft denied us access to their cloud hosting services, we could lose customers who are sensitive to the cloud hosting service platform we utilize for their account.
In addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products, including through selling at zero or negative margins, product bundling, or closed technology platforms. Potential customers may also prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier regardless of product performance or features. These larger competitors often have broader market focus and may therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. To maintain or increase market share, competitors, especially larger competitors, that have greater financial resources than us have offered and may in the future offer their solutions at lower prices. Many of our smaller competitors that specialize in niche data integration technologies may introduce new products which are disruptive to our solution. Conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnering by our competitors, or continuing market consolidation. New start-up companies that innovate and large competitors that are making significant investments in research and development may invent similar or superior products and technologies that compete with our products and technology. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources. While we endeavor to engage customers on our standard form agreements, in order to successfully engage larger customers in a highly competitive environment we may be required to negotiate our standard terms or transact on our customers’ forms, which may result in accepting more onerous terms and obligations, and greater liability exposure, than we do in our standard forms.
Some of our competitors have made or could make acquisitions of businesses that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive solutions than they had previously offered. As a result of such acquisitions, our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs, devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities more readily, or develop and expand their product offerings more quickly than we do. Due to various reasons, organizations may be more willing to add solutions incrementally to their existing data management infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solution. These competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share. Any failure to meet and address these factors could seriously harm our business and results of operations.
If we do not accurately predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to the rapidly evolving technological and market developments and changing customer needs in our market, our competitive position and prospects will be harmed.
The market for our products is characterized by continuing rapid technological development, the emergence of new technologies, evolving industry standards, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. The introduction of products by our direct competitors or others incorporating new technologies, the emergence of new industry standards, or changes in customer requirements could render our existing products obsolete, unmarketable, or less competitive. In addition, industry-wide adoption or increased use of hand-coding, open source standards or other uniform open standards across heterogeneous applications could minimize the importance of the integration functionality of our products and materially adversely affect the competitiveness and market acceptance of our products. Furthermore, the standards on which we choose to develop new products or enhancements may not allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities.
Our success depends upon our ability to enhance existing products, respond to changing customer requirements and develop and introduce, in a timely manner, new products that keep pace with technological and competitive developments and emerging industry standards. For example, many of our customers have transitioned to cloud computing environments, which has accelerated the development of our cloud offerings. We have in the past experienced delays in releasing new products and product 
enhancements and may experience similar delays in the future. We may also pursue marketing strategies that focus on certain products or features over other offerings, and decisions to deploy our limited resources towards particular goals that do not meet a positive market response will harm our operating results. As a result, in the past, some of our customers deferred purchasing our products until the next upgrade was released. Additionally, the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with new product releases, our ability to successfully plan and execute on a sales strategy for our new products, the availability of software components for new products, the effective management of development and other spending in connection with anticipated demand for new products, the availability of newly developed products and the risk that new products may have bugs, errors or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Future delays or problems in the installation or implementation of our new releases may cause customers to forgo purchases of our products and purchase those of our competitors instead. Additionally, even if we are able to develop new products and product enhancements, we they may not achieve market acceptance.
Because of the characteristics of open source software, there are few technological barriers to entry into the open source market by new competitors and it may be relatively easy for competitors, some of whom may have greater resources than we have, to enter our markets and compete with us.
One of the characteristics of open source software is that anyone may obtain access to the source code for our open source products and then modify and redistribute the existing open source software and use it to compete in the marketplace. Such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies. It is possible for competitors to develop their own software, including software based on Talend Open Studio, potentially reducing the demand for our solution and putting price pressure on our subscription offerings. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and competitive pressure or the availability of new open source software may result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We may be unable to predict the future course of open source technology development, which could reduce the market appeal of our offerings, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We do not exercise control over many aspects of the development of open source technology. Different groups of open source software programmers compete with one another to develop new technology. Typically, the technology developed by one group will become more widely used than that developed by others. If we acquire or adopt new technology and incorporate it into our offerings but competing technology becomes more widely used or accepted, the market appeal of our offerings may be reduced, which could harm our reputation, diminish our brands and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
A significant defect, security vulnerability, error or performance failure in our software could cause us to lose revenue and expose us to liability.
The software and professional services we offer are inherently complex and, despite extensive testing and quality control, have in the past and may in the future contain defects or errors or not perform as contemplated, especially when first introduced. These defects, security vulnerabilities, errors or performance failures could cause damage to our reputation, loss of customers or revenue, product returns, order cancellations, service terminations, or lack of market acceptance of our software, all of which could negatively impact our business and operating results and materially damage our reputation and brand. As the use of our solution, including products that were recently acquired or developed, expands to more sensitive, secure, or mission critical uses by our customers, we may be subject to increased scrutiny, potential reputational risk, or potential liability should our software fail to perform as advertised or contemplated in such deployments. We have in the past and may in the future need to issue corrective releases of our software to fix these defects, errors or performance failures, which could require us to allocate significant research and development and customer support resources and capital to address these problems.
Our standard form agreements with our customers typically contain provisions intended to limit both the types of claims for which we would be liable and the maximum amount of our liability. However, some of our customers require us to accept contract terms that do not include the same limitations. Additionally, any limitation of liability provisions that may be contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future national, federal, state, or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions. Any liability claims with respect to defects, security vulnerabilities, errors, or performance 
failures of our products could be substantial in light of the use of our products in enterprise-wide environments. In addition, our insurance against this liability, subject to applicable deductibles, may not be adequate to cover a potential claim, and if we experienced a significant incident that impacted many customers, we could be subject to indemnity claims or other damages that exceed our insurance coverage. If such a breach or incident occurred, our insurance coverage might not be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, such insurance may not continue to be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all, and insurers may deny us coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.
A breach of our security measures or unauthorized access to private or proprietary data, or a perception that any security breach or other incident has occurred, may result in our software being perceived as not secure, lower customer use or stoppage of use of our products, and significant liabilities.
Our products involve the processing of large amounts of our customers’ sensitive and proprietary information, as well as personal data and personal information. Additionally, we collect and store certain sensitive and proprietary information, and personal data and personal information, in the operation of our business, including trade secrets, intellectual property, employee data, and other confidential data. While we have taken measures to protect our own proprietary and confidential information, as well as the personal information, personal data, and confidential information that we otherwise obtain, including confidential information we may obtain through customer usage of our cloud offerings, we have experienced and may in the future experience, security breaches, including breaches resulting from a cybersecurity attack, phishing attack, or other means, including unauthorized access, unauthorized usage, viruses or similar breaches or disruptions. These attacks may come from individual hackers, criminal groups, and state-sponsored organizations. These sources can also implement social engineering techniques to induce our employees, contractors, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our customers’ data. Further, security breaches and other security incidents may result from employee or contractor error or negligence or those of vendors, service providers, and strategic partners on which we rely. We may be more susceptible to security breaches and other security incidents while social distancing measures restricting the ability of our employees to work at our offices are in place to combat the COVID-19 pandemic because we have less capability to implement, monitor and enforce our information security and data protection policies.
Any compromise of our security or any unauthorized access to or breaches of the security of our or our service providers’ systems or data processing tools or processes, or of our product offerings, as a result of third-party action, employee error, defects or bugs, malfeasance, or otherwise, which results in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our proprietary or confidential information, personal information or other private or proprietary data, or any such information or data of our customers, could result in the loss or corruption of any such information or data, or unauthorized access to or acquisition of, such information or data. We have experienced unauthorized access to information from certain of our application code repositories, hosted by a third-party provider, and from a separate cloud services platform. Past and future security breaches could result in reputational damage, litigation, regulatory investigations and orders, loss of business, loss of intellectual property, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws, regulations, or contractual obligations, and significant costs, fees and other monetary payments for remediation, including in connection with costly and burdensome breach notification requirements.
Further, any belief by customers or others that a security breach or other incident has affected us or any of our vendors or service providers, even if a security breach or other incident has not affected us or any of our vendors or service provides or has not actually occurred, could have any or all of the foregoing impacts on us, including damage to our reputation. Even the perception of inadequate security may damage our reputation and negatively impact our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers.
We incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents, and we expect our costs will increase as we make improvements to our systems and processes to prevent future breaches and incidents. In the event of a future breach or incident, we could be required to expend additional significant capital and other resources in an effort to prevent further breaches or incidents. Moreover, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address the incident and any future data security incident or breach.
We engage third-party vendors and service providers to store and otherwise process some of our and our customers’ data, including sensitive and personal information. Our vendors and service providers have been and in the future may be the targets of cyberattacks, malicious software, phishing schemes, fraud, and other risks to the confidentiality, security, and integrity of their 
systems and the data they process for us. Our ability to monitor our vendors and service providers’ data security is limited, and, in any event, third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures, resulting in the unauthorized access to, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of our and our customers’ data, including sensitive and personal information. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our third-party providers’ systems and networks have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our services.
Techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems or networks are constantly evolving and, in some instances, are not identified until launched against a target. We and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques, react, remediate or otherwise address any security breach or other security incident in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventative measures. In December 2020, one of our vendors, SolarWinds, disclosed that it was the subject of a cyberattack that inserted a vulnerability within its Orion monitoring products which, if present and activated, could potentially allow an attacker to compromise the server on which the Orion products run. We do not believe we were impacted by the vulnerability, but continue to monitor the situation. In addition, laws, regulations, government guidance, and industry standards and practices in the United States and elsewhere are rapidly evolving to combat these threats. We may face increased compliance burdens regarding such requirements with regulators and customers regarding our products and services and also incur additional costs for oversight and monitoring of our own supply chain.
Any limitations of liability provisions in our customer and user agreements, contracts with third-party vendors and service providers or other contracts may not be enforceable or adequate or otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other security-related matter. While our insurance policies include liability coverage for certain of these matters, subject to applicable deductibles, if we experienced a widespread security breach or other incident that impacted a significant number of our customers, we could be subject to indemnity claims or other damages that exceed our insurance coverage. If such a breach or incident occurred, our insurance coverage might not be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, such insurance may not continue to be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all, and insurers may deny us coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.
Our rebranding efforts to maintain and enhance our brands may not be successful.
We believe that the brand identities that we have developed have contributed significantly to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is important to expanding our customer base and attracting talented employees. In order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make further investments that may not be successful. During 2020 we introduced new branding, including a new logo, new trade dress, and new messaging, which if not successful could adversely affect our brand image and identity and our marketing efforts. Maintaining our brands will depend in part on our ability to remain a leader in data integration and integrity technology and our ability to continue to provide high-quality offerings. If we fail to promote and maintain our brands, or if we incur excessive costs in doing so, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be harmed.
Any failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.
In September 2019, we received net proceeds of $149.1 million (after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount) from the issuance of 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due September 1, 2024, or the 2024 Notes. To that end, we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. We anticipate negative cash flows during fiscal 2021 as we intend to make investments in our business in order to support our growth. We have a history of negative cash flow from operating activities and as a result may need to raise additional funds in the future or we may elect to raise additional capital to fund investments in our business or strategic investments. If we seek to raise capital for any reason, we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, we expect that our status as a French entity and our ADS structure may negatively impact the trading volume of our ADSs, which may harm our ability to access capital from the public markets. If we raise additional capital by issuing equity or securities convertible into equity, our shareholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our ordinary shares and ADSs could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in debt financing, the holders of debt would have priority over the holders of ADSs and ordinary shares, and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. We may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders and force us to maintain 
specified liquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we need or seek additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:
•Develop or enhance our products and professional services;
•Continue to expand our sales and marketing and research and development organizations;
•Acquire complementary technologies, products or businesses;
•Expand operations in the United States or internationally;
•Hire, train and retain employees; or
•Respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.
Our failure to have sufficient capital to do any of these things could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our relatively limited operating history, particularly as a cloud company, makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects and may increase the risks associated with your investment.
We were founded in 2005, launched our first product in 2006 and began offering our platform on a subscription basis in 2007. Our relatively limited operating history, particularly as a cloud company, makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries, including changing customer preferences, competing offerings and pricing, evolving sales strategies and other risks described in this Annual Report. If we do not address these risks successfully, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected, and the market price of our ADSs and ordinary shares could decline. Further, we have limited historical financial data and we operate in a rapidly evolving market. As such, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market.
Delivering certain of our products via the cloud increases our expenses and may pose other challenges to our business.
We offer and sell our products via both the cloud and on premise using the customer’s own infrastructure. Historically, our products were developed in the context of the deployed offering, and we have less operating experience offering and selling our products via our cloud offering. Although a majority of our revenue has historically been generated from customers using our term-based deployed licenses, a majority of our new subscription business comes from the cloud and we believe that over time more customers will continue to move to the cloud offering. As more of our customers transition to the cloud, we may be subject to additional contractual obligations with respect to privacy, data security and data protection, as well as competitive pressures and higher operating costs, any of which may harm our business. If our cloud offering does not develop as quickly as we expect, or if we are unable to continue to scale our systems to meet the requirements of a large cloud offering, our business may be harmed. We are directing a significant portion of our financial and operating resources to implement a robust cloud offering for our products and to support our existing customers' transition to our cloud offerings, but even if we continue to make these investments, we may be unsuccessful in growing or implementing our cloud offering competitively, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.
The sales prices of our products may decrease, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our financial results.
The sales prices for our subscription offerings and professional services may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, a change in our mix of subscription offerings and professional services and their respective margins, introduction of new pricing models such as on-demand pricing or new sales models, anticipation of the introduction of new subscription offerings or professional services, or promotional programs. Competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate, and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Additionally, currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may negatively impact actual prices that channel partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions. We may not be successful in developing and introducing new subscription offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis. Any such new subscription offerings, if introduced, may not enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to achieve and maintain profitability. 
The competitive position of our product offerings depends in part on their ability to operate with third-party products and services and our customers’ existing infrastructure.
The competitive position of our product offerings depends in part on their ability to operate with products and services of third parties, including companies that offer big data solutions, cloud solutions, software services and infrastructure, and our products must be continuously modified and enhanced to adapt to changes in hardware, software, networking, browser and database technologies. In the future, one or more technology companies, whether our partners or otherwise, may choose not to support the operation of their software, software services and infrastructure with our product offerings. In addition, to the extent that a third-party were to develop software or services that compete with ours, that provider may choose not to support our product offering. We intend to facilitate the compatibility of our solution with various third-party software, big data solutions, cloud solutions, software services and infrastructure offerings by maintaining and expanding our business and technical relationships. If we are not successful in achieving this goal, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
Additionally, our products must interoperate with our customers’ existing infrastructure, which often have different specifications, deploy products from multiple vendors, and contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time. As a result, when problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems. If we find errors in the existing software that create integration errors or problems in our customers’ IT environments, as we have in the past, we may have to issue software updates as part of our normal maintenance process. Any delays in identifying the sources of problems or in providing necessary modifications to our software could have a negative impact on our reputation and our customers’ satisfaction with our products and services, and our ability to sell products and services could be adversely affected. In addition, governments and other customers may require our products to comply with certain security or other certifications and standards.
We rely on channel partners to execute a portion of our sales. If our channel partners fail to perform, our ability to sell our solution will be limited, and, if we fail to optimize our channel partner model going forward, our results of operations will be harmed.
A portion of our revenue is generated by sales through our channel partners, especially in international markets. As we grow our business into new and existing international markets, we expect that our reliance on channel partners to generate sales will also grow. We provide our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our products, but these steps may not be effective. In addition, our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing, selling and supporting our products. The COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation measures may adversely affect the ability of our channel partners to sell our products, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, if we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive programs for our channel partners, we may not be able to incentivize these partners to sell our products to customers and, in particular, to large enterprises. These partners may also market, sell, and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing, sales and support of such competitive products. These partners may have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our products altogether. Our agreements with our channel partners may generally be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice prior to each annual renewal date. We may not retain these channel partners and may not be able to secure additional or replacement channel partners. The loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or a decline in the number or size of orders from any of them could harm our results of operations. In addition, any new channel partner requires extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity. Our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability and reputational harm if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresents the functionality of our products or services to customers or violates laws or our corporate policies. If we fail to effectively manage our existing sales channels, if our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our products, or if we are unable to enter into arrangements with, and retain a sufficient number of, high-quality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and services and keep them motivated to sell our products, our ability to sell our products and results of operations will be harmed.
If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our strategic partners, our business operations, financial results and growth prospects could be adversely affected.
In addition to our direct sales force and channel partners, we maintain strategic relationships with a variety of strategic partners, including systems integrators, consulting firms, and big data, cloud application and analytical software vendors, to jointly market and sell our subscription offerings. We expect that sales through our strategic partners will continue to grow as a proportion of our revenue for the foreseeable future.
Our agreements with our strategic partners are generally non-exclusive, meaning our strategic partners may offer customers the products and services of several different companies, including products and services that compete with ours, or may themselves be or become competitors. If our strategic partners do not effectively market and sell our subscription offerings, choose to use greater efforts to market and sell their own products and services or those of our competitors, or fail to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to grow our business and sell our subscription offerings may be harmed. Our strategic partners may be adversely affected by temporary office closures and travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and be unable to or less effective at selling our subscription offerings. Further, our strategic partners may cease marketing our subscription offerings with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. The loss of a substantial number of our strategic partners, our possible inability to replace them, or the failure to recruit additional strategic partners could harm our results of operations.
Our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our strategic partners, and in helping our partners enhance their ability to market and sell our subscription offerings. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these strategic partners, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be harmed.
Reliance on sales at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels.
As a result of customer buying patterns, we have historically received a substantial portion of subscriptions during the last month of each fiscal quarter. If expected sales at the end of any fiscal quarter are delayed for any reason, including the failure of anticipated purchases to materialize, particularly larger deals that may be dictated by a customer’s internal evaluation process outside of our control, our inability to release new products on schedule, any failure of our systems related to order review and processing, or any delays in order fulfillment based on trade compliance requirements, our cash flows and results of operations for that quarter, and our revenue for subsequent periods could fall below our expectations and the estimates of analysts, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations and cause a decline in the market price of our ADSs or ordinary shares.
The seasonality of our business can create variance in our quarterly purchases, subscription revenue and cash flows from operations.
We operate on a December 31 fiscal year end and believe that there are seasonal factors which may cause us to experience lower levels of sales in our first fiscal quarter ending March 31 as compared with other quarters. We believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors, including:
•Companies using their IT budget at the end of the calendar year resulting in higher sales activity in the quarter ending December 31;
•Sales personnel being compensated on annual plans and finalizing sales transactions in the quarter ending December 31, thereby exhausting most of their sales pipeline for the quarter ending December 31; and
•Recruiting sales personnel primarily in the first and second quarters, which leads to greater sales productivity in the second half of the fiscal year.
Additionally, to the extent we experience lower new customer purchases in earlier quarters, the resulting reduced subscription revenue may not be reflected in our operating results until subsequent quarters. We believe that these seasonal trends have been masked in recent periods due to our growth, but we anticipate that they may be more pronounced in future periods.
Our future quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could adversely affect the trading price of our ADSs.
Our results of operations, including the levels of our revenue, cost of revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and deferred revenue, have fluctuated from quarter-to-quarter in the past and may continue to vary in the future so that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, our financial results in any one quarter should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, may be difficult to predict, and may or may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. If our revenue does not meet our expectations, we are unlikely to be able to adjust our spending to levels commensurate with our revenue. As a result, the effect of revenue shortfalls on our results of operations may be more accentuated, and these and other fluctuations in quarterly results may negatively affect the market price of our ADSs and ordinary shares.
Our current research and development efforts may not produce successful products or features that result in significant revenue, cost savings or other benefits in the near future, if at all.
Developing our products and related enhancements is expensive. Our investments in research and development may not result in significant design improvements, marketable products or features, or may result in products that are more expensive than anticipated. Additionally, we may not achieve the cost savings or the anticipated performance improvements we expect, and we may take longer to generate revenue, or generate less revenue, than we anticipate. Our future plans include significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position, including through the use of external consultant resources. However, we may not receive significant revenue from these investments in the near future, if at all, or these investments may not yield the expected benefits, either of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
A portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.
Sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. Government certification requirements for products like ours may change, thereby restricting our ability to sell into the U.S. federal government, U.S. state government, or foreign government sectors until we have attained the revised certification. Government demand and payment for our subscription offerings and professional services may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our subscription offerings and professional services. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused governments to run significant budget deficits, which may result in cuts to government budgets and adversely affect demand from government entities for our solutions.
Governmental entities often require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements, including terms that can lead to those customers obtaining broader rights in our products than would be standard. Government entities may have statutory, contractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely affect our future results of operations. Governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our subscription offerings, a reduction of revenue, or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, which could adversely affect our results of operations in a material way.
We have a limited track record in acquiring and integrating other businesses and we may acquire other businesses, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and adversely affect our results of operations.
As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies. For example, in November 2018 we acquired Stitch Inc. Our ability as an organization to acquire and integrate other companies, products, or technologies in a successful manner is relatively unproven given our limited track record. Our ability to successfully acquire companies, products and technologies depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may be unable to take advantage of opportunities to make beneficial acquisitions or investments. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates is difficult, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete future acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and business strategy, we may be subject to claims or liabilities assumed from an acquired company, product, or technology, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers, investors and securities analysts. In addition, if we are unsuccessful at integrating any future acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, which may disrupt our ongoing business and divert management’s attention, and we may not be able to manage the integration process successfully. Our integration of future acquisitions would be particularly challenging for us during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to temporary office closures, restrictions on travel, and remote working, and may not be successful.
We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, realize anticipated synergies from the acquisition, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction and integration of such acquisition, including accounting charges. We may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity to pay for any future acquisitions, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our ADSs and ordinary shares. The issuance of equity to finance 
any future acquisitions could result in dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Catastrophic events or man-made incidents may disrupt our business and we may be more vulnerable to such events due to the location of our operations.
A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, or significant power outage could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our primary U.S. office is located in Redwood City, California in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity and wildfires. In addition, the San Francisco Bay Area has been subject to power blackouts to mitigate the risk of wildfires and our Redwood City office could be subject to such blackouts, potentially for an extended period of time. In the event our or our channel partners’ abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, sales could be delayed, resulting in missed financial targets, such as revenue or cash flow, for a particular quarter. In addition, acts of terrorism, epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, geopolitical unrest, or other man-made problems could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our channel partners, customers or the economy as a whole. Any disruption in the business of our channel partners or customers that affects sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our future quarterly results. Further, if a natural disaster or man-made problem were to affect Internet service providers, this could adversely affect the ability of our customers to use our products. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. To the extent that any of the above should result in our inability to continue our operations, system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our development activities, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, delays or cancellations of customer orders, or the delay in the deployment of our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
Risks Related to Intellectual Property
Failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and results of operations.
Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology, methodologies, know-how and our brand. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, contractual restrictions, patents and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property, including any intellectual property, including trading secrets, obtained through a breach of our information technology systems. In fact, in the past we have experienced breaches into our information technology systems that could have resulted in unauthorized access to our intellectual property. As a result of past breaches or a failure in the future to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights that we have or may obtain may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. As of December 31, 2020, we had two issued patents and one pending patent application in the United States. We intend to seek further patent protection in the future; however, we may be unable to obtain any patent protection for our technology. In addition, our issued patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products are available. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. As we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information will likely increase. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.
We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with other parties. These agreements, however, may not be effective in controlling access to and 
distribution of our proprietary information. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products.
In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Further, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our products, impair the functionality of our products, delay introductions of new products, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our products, or injure our reputation.
We could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement or other violations by us of another party’s intellectual property rights.
In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights in the software industry. Companies providing software are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging violations of proprietary rights, particularly patent infringement, misappropriation or other violations, and to the extent we gain greater market visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other claims. As of December 31, 2020, we had two issued patents and one pending patent application in the United States. As a result, we currently have a limited patent portfolio, which could prevent us from deterring patent infringement claims through our own patent portfolio, and our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have. The risk of patent litigation has been amplified by the increase in the number of a type of patent holder, which we refer to as a non-practicing entity, whose sole business is to assert such claims and against whom our own intellectual property portfolio may provide little deterrent value. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending any intellectual property litigation. If we sue to enforce our rights or are sued by a third-party that claims that we or our solution violates its intellectual property rights, the litigation could be expensive and could divert our management resources. Any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or more of the following:
•Cease selling or using products that incorporate the intellectual property that we allegedly infringe;
•Make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;
•Obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to sell or use the relevant technology; or
•Redesign the allegedly infringing products to avoid infringement, which could be costly, time-consuming or impossible.
If we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement or other claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers for such claims, such payments or actions could harm our business.
Our use of open source software could negatively affect our ability to sell our solution and subject us to possible litigation.
A portion of our technologies incorporate open source software, and we expect to continue to incorporate open source software in our solution in the future. Few of the licenses applicable to open source software have been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. Moreover, if we incorporate or have incorporated open source software in our software in a manner that is inconsistent with the terms of the applicable license or our current policies and procedures, then we may be subject to certain requirements, including requirements that we offer our solutions that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of applicable open source licenses. If an author or other third-party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our solutions that contained the open source software and required to comply with onerous conditions or restrictions on these solutions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of these solutions. In addition, there have been claims challenging the ownership rights in of open source software 
against companies that incorporate open source software into their products, and the licensors of such open source software provide no warranties or indemnities with respect to such claims. In any of these events, we and our customers could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, and to re-engineer our products or discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis. We and our customers may also be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement due to the reliance by our solutions on certain open source software, and such litigation could be costly for us to defend or subject us to an injunction. Any of the foregoing could require us to devote additional research and development resources to re-engineer our solutions, could result in customer dissatisfaction, and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Risks Related to Litigation and the Regulation of our Business
We may be the subject of litigation which, if adversely determined, could harm our business and operating results.
Our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, laws relating to data privacy, data security and data protection, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages and civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. We have been, currently are, and may in the future be, subject to legal claims arising in the normal course of business. Such legal claims have included intellectual property-related, commercial, and employment claims, and may in the future include those categories of claims, as well as, product liability, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims. An unfavorable outcome on any litigation matter could require that we pay substantial damages. In addition, we may decide to settle any litigation, which could cause us to incur significant costs.
The outcome of litigation and other claims or lawsuits is intrinsically uncertain. Management’s view of the litigation might also change in the future. Actual outcomes of litigation and other claims or lawsuits could differ from the assessments made by management in prior periods, which are the basis for our accounting for these litigations and claims under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. A settlement or an unfavorable outcome on any litigation matter could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, reputation, financial position or cash flows. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
In connection with the operation of our business, we collect, store, transfer and otherwise process certain personal data and personally identifiable information. As a result, our business is subject to a variety of federal, state, foreign government and industry regulations, as well as self-regulation, related to privacy, data security and data protection. Our actual or perceived failure to protect personal data and other information could have an adverse effect on our business.
Privacy, data security, and data protection have become significant issues in the United States, Europe and in other jurisdictions where we offer our products. The regulatory frameworks for privacy, data security, and data protection issues worldwide are rapidly evolving, being tested in courts, likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny, as well as escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. Federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, new laws and regulations or may make amendments to existing laws and regulations affecting privacy, data security and data protection, including the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data and other information. Industry organizations also regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in these areas.
Moreover, evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information, within the European Union, the United States and elsewhere, especially relating to classification of IP addresses, machine identification, location data and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data. Any perception of privacy, security, or data protection concerns or an inability to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, even if unfounded, may result in additional cost and liability to us, harm our reputation and inhibit adoption of our products by current and future customers, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In the United States, we may be subject to investigation and/or enforcement actions brought by federal agencies and state attorneys general and consumer protection agencies. We publicly post notices and other documentation regarding our practices 
concerning the processing, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information and other data. Although we endeavor to comply with our published notices and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The publication of our privacy notices and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about privacy, data security, and data protection can subject us to potential state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices.
At the federal level, we have reviewed our privacy, data security, and data protection policies and procedures in regard to our role as a business associate for customers that are covered entities and as a sub-business associate for customers that are business associates under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which we refer to as HIPAA.
As a business associate we are subject to the privacy, security, data breach notification, and enforcement rules, or the HIPAA Rules, promulgated pursuant to HIPAA by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, as well as similar state medical information privacy laws. In addition to contractual obligations with our customers that are covered entities or business associates, should we be deemed in violation of the HIPAA Rules as a result of an audit from HHS, we may be exposed to civil and criminal liabilities. State Attorneys General also have the authority to bring civil actions on behalf of state residents for violations of the HIPAA Rules and equivalent state law, obtain damages on behalf of state residents, or to enjoin further violations of the HIPAA Rules and state law.
At the state level, on June 28, 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and other information. The enforcement of the CCPA by the California Attorney General commenced on July 1, 2020. We cannot fully predict the impact of the CCPA on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, recently was approved by California voters in November 2020. We are currently assessing the impact of CPRA's significant modifications to the CCPA on our data processing practices and policies. Our ongoing assessment and any necessary changes to our data processing practices and policies may potentially require us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of our users' data or additional requirements for express or implied consent of users for the use, disclosure or other processing of such information could increase our operating expenses, require us to modify our solutions, possibly in a material manner, or stop offering certain solutions, and could limit our ability to develop and implement new features.
Internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own privacy, data security and data protection legal frameworks with which we or our customers must comply. In the European Union, or EU, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, replaced prior EU data protection law as of May 25, 2018. The GDPR imposes additional obligations and risk upon our business and increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. Administrative fines under the GDPR can be as great as 20 million euros or four percent of annual global turnover, whichever is greater. We have incurred substantial expense in complying with the obligations imposed by the GDPR and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations in connection with compliance with the GDPR, all of which may adversely affect our revenue and our business overall. Additionally, because the GDPR contains a number of obligations that differ from previously-effective data protection legislation in the EU, and because the GDPR’s enforcement history is limited, we are unable to predict how certain obligations under the GDPR may be applied to us. Despite our efforts to attempt to comply with the GDPR, a regulator may determine that we have not done so and subject us to fines and public censure, which could harm our company.
Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data outside of the European Economic Area, or EEA, to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States. We have undertaken certain efforts to conform transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States, or U.S., and other jurisdictions based on our understanding of current regulatory obligations and the guidance of data protection authorities, including the use of standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, or SCCs, and our certifications under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks. With regard to transfers to the U.S. of personal data from our employees and European customers and users, we rely upon the SCCs. The “Schrems II” decision issued by the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, on July 16, 2020, invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a mechanism to transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States. In the same decision, the CJEU confirmed the validity of the SCCs, but advised that the SCCs must be considered on a case-by-case basis, in conjunction with an assessment as to whether national security laws conflict with the guarantees provided by the data importer under the SCCs. Although we believe we continue to satisfy regulatory 
requirements through our use of SCCs, these latest developments represent a milestone in the regulation of cross-border data transfers, and require major changes to our data transfer policy, including the need to conduct legal, technical, and security assessments for each data transfer from the EEA to a country outside of the EEA. This means that we may be unsuccessful in maintaining legitimate means for our transfer and receipt of personal data from the EEA. We may, in addition to other impacts, experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens, and we and our customers face the potential for regulators in the EEA to apply different standards to the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S., and to block, or require ad hoc verification of measures taken with respect to, certain data flows from the EEA to the U.S. We also may be required to engage in new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing data on our behalf. We may experience reluctance or refusal by current or prospective European customers to use our products, and we may find it necessary or desirable to make further changes to our handling of personal data of EEA residents.
The regulatory environment applicable to the handling of EEA residents' personal data, and our actions taken in response, may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs and could result in our business, operating results and financial condition being harmed. We and our customers may face a risk of enforcement actions by data protection authorities in the EEA relating to personal data transfers to us and by us from the EEA. Any such enforcement actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, distract management and technical personnel and negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
The GDPR also gave more weight to other existing EU data protection rules, and in particular the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002/58/EC (or ePrivacy Directive), which regulates electronic marketing activities in the EEA. The ePrivacy Directive has strict rules restricting communication with individuals for marketing purposes, and these rules have been implemented heterogeneously by European Union member states. To comply with local legal requirements, we have incurred significant costs to attempt to ensure that our electronic marketing activities are (1) adapted to the legal framework of the relevant EU member state in which we are sending electronic marketing communication, and (2) updated regularly to address changes in local case law and, as appropriate, privacy recommendations from local authorities. Failure to comply with the ePrivacy Directive and its implementing rules exposes us to additional reputational and financial risk under the GDPR.
Further, on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom left the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Brexit may lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. The United Kingdom has implemented legislation that substantially implements the GDPR, with penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of £17.5 million or four percent of worldwide revenues. Aspects of data protection regulation remain unclear in the medium- to long-term, however, including with regard to regulation of data transfers to and from the United Kingdom. For example, pursuant to a post-Brexit agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU, the European Commission will continue to treat the United Kingdom as if it remained a member state of the EU in relation to transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United Kingdom, meaning such transfers may be made without a need for additional safeguards, for four months from January 1, 2021, with a potential additional two-month extension. This “transition” period, however, will end if and when the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of the United Kingdom or the United Kingdom amends certain United Kingdom data protection laws, or relevant aspects thereof, in certain manners without the EU’s consent. If the European Commission does not adopt an adequacy decision with regard to personal data transfers to the United Kingdom before the expiration of the transition period, the United Kingdom will be considered a “third country” under the GDPR and such transfers will need to be made subject to GDPR-compliant safeguards (for example, the SCCs). With substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of how the United Kingdom will approach and address the GDPR following the transition period, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so.
Owing to the regulatory environment and sentiment regarding international data transfers, we may experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multinational customers to continue to use our platform. We may find it necessary or appropriate to establish systems to maintain personal data originating from certain countries or regions within those countries or regions. This may involve substantial expense and may cause us to need to divert resources from other aspects of our business, all of which may adversely affect our business.
In addition, some countries are considering or have enacted legislation, such as the Japan Act on Protection of Personal Information, which we are subject to, requiring local storage and processing of data that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. 
In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that may legally or contractually apply to us. One example of such a self-regulatory standard is the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, which relates to the processing of payment card information. In the event we fail to 
comply with the PCI DSS, fines and other penalties could result, and we may suffer reputational harm and damage to our business. We may also be bound by and agree to contractual obligations to comply with other obligations relating to privacy, data security, or data protection, such as particular standards for information security measures. Further, we expect that there will continue to be changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or new proposed laws and regulations concerning privacy, data security, and data protection. We cannot yet determine the impact these laws and regulations or changed interpretations may have on our business, but we anticipate that they could impair our or our customers’ ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to consumers, which could decrease demand for our platform, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue.
Moreover, because the interpretation and application of many laws and regulations relating to privacy, security, and data protection, along with mandatory industry standards, are uncertain, it is possible that these laws, regulations and standards, or contractual obligations to which we are or may become subject, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing or future data management practices or features of our products. Any actual or perceived loss, improper retention or misuse of personal data, personal information, or other information or any actual or alleged violations of laws and regulations relating to privacy, security, or data protection could result in us facing regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, fines, lawsuits and other claims (including from customers and individuals), penalties, consent decrees or other orders that may hamper our ability to conduct business or adapt our business, and liability, including potential criminal liability of company executives, and we could find it necessary or appropriate to fundamentally change our products, or our practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any actual or perceived inability to adequately address privacy, data security, and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable privacy, data security, and data protection laws, regulations, policies or other obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation and market position (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), cause us to lose goodwill, inhibit sales and adversely affect our operations, financial performance and business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our products. Privacy, security, and data protection concerns, whether valid or not, may inhibit market adoption of our products, particularly in certain industries and foreign countries. If we are not able to adjust to changing laws, regulations and standards in these areas, our business may be harmed.
We are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls.
Our business activities are subject to U.S. export controls, specifically the Export Administration Regulations, and economic sanctions enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Because our products use encryption, certain of our products are subject to U.S. export controls and may be exported from the United States only with the required export license or through an export license exception. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. The inclusion of one of our foreign customers on any U.S. Government sanctioned persons list, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s List of Denied Persons and the U.S. Department of Treasury’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, may also be material to our business. Any failure to comply with the U.S. export requirements, U.S. customs regulations, U.S. economic sanctions, or other laws could result in the imposition of penalties against the Company or individuals responsible for any such violations. The penalties may include substantial civil and criminal fines, incarceration for responsible employees and managers, the possible loss of export or import privileges and reputational harm. 
In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent or delay the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export to or sell our products in international markets would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Employment laws in some of the countries in which we operate are stringent, which could restrict our ability to react to market changes and cause us to incur higher expenses.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,397 full-time employees, of whom approximately 37% were located in the United States, 28% were located in France, 7% were located in Germany, 7% were located in China and 7% were located in the United Kingdom. In some of the countries in which we operate, employment laws may grant significant job protection to certain employees, including rights on termination of employment and setting maximum number of hours and days per week a particular employee is permitted to work. In addition, in certain countries in which we operate, we are often required to consult and seek the advice of employee representatives and unions. These laws, coupled with the requirement to consult with any relevant employee representatives and unions, could affect our ability to react to market changes and the needs of our business and cause us to incur higher expenses.
Failure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the United States could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.
We are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, the French anti-corruption law known as “Sapin II” and possibly other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. We face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws that prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties or candidates, employees of public international organizations and private-sector recipients for a corrupt purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person, or securing any advantage. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we use various third-party intermediaries to sell our solutions and conduct our business abroad. We, our channel partners, and our other third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. Although we continue to implement our FCPA/anti-corruption compliance program, some of our employees and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may nevertheless take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.
Any violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action may result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.
Risks Related to Our International Operations
Our international operations and expansion expose us to several risks.
During each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, a majority of our total revenue was generated outside of the United States. Our primary research and development operations are located in France, China, Germany, and the United States. In addition, we currently have international offices outside of those countries, which focus primarily on selling and implementing our solution in those regions. In the future, we may expand to other international locations. Our current international operations and future initiatives will involve a variety of risks, including:
•Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions;
•Government trade restrictions, including those which may impose restrictions, including prohibitions, on the exportation, re-exportation, sale, shipment or other transfer of programming, technology, components and/or services to foreign persons;
•Changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes and other trade barriers;
•Tariffs imposed by the U.S. government on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs implemented and additional tariffs that have been proposed by the U.S. government on various imports from China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union and by the governments of these jurisdictions on certain U.S. goods, and any other possible tariffs that may be imposed on services such as ours, the scope and duration of which, if implemented, remains uncertain;
•Different labor regulations, especially in the European Union, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;
•Exposure to many onerous and potentially inconsistent privacy, data security, and data protection laws and regulations, particularly in the European Union and California;
•Changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions;
•The impact of pandemics and epidemics, like COVID-19, on global and regional economic conditions, international and domestic travel, and IT spending budgets;
•Deterioration of political relations between the United States and France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations in these countries;
•Challenges inherent to efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;
•Risks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates and the implementation of exchange controls, including restrictions promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and other similar trade protection regulations and measures in the United States or in other jurisdictions;
•Reduced ability to timely collect amounts owed to us by our clients in countries where our recourse may be more limited;
•Limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations derived from one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;
•Limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;
•Exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the FCPA, and similar applicable laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; and
•Restrictions on repatriation of earnings.
Furthermore, weak domestic or global economic conditions, fear or anticipation of such conditions, or uncertainty how the U.S. or foreign governments will act with respect to tariffs, international trade agreements and policies, and the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects in a number of ways, including lower prices for our products, reduced sales and lower or no growth. For example, the global macroeconomic environment could be negatively affected by, among other things, instability in global economic markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, increased U.S. trade tariffs and trade disputes between the U.S. and other countries, instability in the global credit markets, the impact and uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, changes in interest rates and increased inflation, the instability in the geopolitical environment as a result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, and ongoing U.S. and foreign governmental debt concerns. Such challenges have caused, and are likely to continue to cause, uncertainty and instability in local economies and in global financial markets, particularly if any future sovereign debt defaults or significant bank failures or defaults occur. Any market uncertainty and instability in Europe, Asia or the United States could intensify or spread further, particularly if stabilization efforts implemented by central banks or policymakers prove insufficient. Moreover, continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may also affect the overall demand for our products. In fact, we anticipate that current political and economic conditions in Europe may negatively impact revenue growth in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. A prolonged period of economic uncertainty or a downturn may also significantly affect financing markets, the availability of capital and the terms and conditions of financing arrangements, including the overall cost of financing. Circumstances may arise in which we need, or desire, to raise additional capital, and such capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
We have dedicated the majority of our resources in marketing, selling and supporting our solutions to France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations to new markets and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and results of operations will suffer. Additionally, operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. The investment and additional resources required in establishing operations in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.
If we are not successful in sustaining and expanding our international business, we may incur additional losses and our revenue growth could be harmed.
Our future results depend, in part, on our ability to sustain and expand our penetration of the international markets in which we currently operate and to expand into additional international markets. We depend on direct sales and our channel partner relationships to sell our subscription offerings and professional services in international markets. Our ability to expand internationally will depend upon our ability to deliver functionality and foreign language translations that reflect the needs of the international clients that we target. Our ability to expand internationally involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in such expansion, and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved in the near future or at all in these less familiar competitive environments. We may also choose to conduct our international business through strategic alliances. If we are unable to identify strategic alliance partners or negotiate favorable alliance terms, our international growth may be harmed. In addition, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses in advance of generating material revenue as we attempt to establish our presence in particular international markets.
Sustaining and expanding our international business will also require significant attention from our management and will require us to add additional management and other resources in these new markets. Our ability to expand our business, attract talented employees, maintain consistent sales and marketing practices and standards across regions, and enter into channel partnerships in an increasing number of international markets requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems, commercial infrastructures and technology infrastructure. If we are unable to grow our international operations in a timely and effective manner, we may incur additional losses and our revenue growth could be harmed.
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
A portion of our subscription agreements and operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro. Due to disparate government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign currency exchange rates have been and could continue to be subject to increased volatility. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar increases the real cost of our products to some of our customers outside of the United States where we price in U.S. dollar instead of local currency, leading to delays in the purchase of our products and the lengthening of our sales cycle. If the U.S. dollar strengthens, this could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased international sales in the future, including through our channel partners and other partnerships, may result in greater foreign currency denominated sales, increasing our foreign currency risk. Moreover, operating expenses incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies are increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are not able to successfully manage the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, these transactions may be ineffective at hedging our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Exposure to United Kingdom political developments, including the impact of “Brexit”, could have a material adverse effect on us.
On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom left the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU creates an uncertain political and economic environment in the United Kingdom and potentially across other EU member states, for the foreseeable future, including while the United Kingdom reviews and reforms regulations derived from its prior membership in the EU. The political and economic instability created by the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and the value of the Pound Sterling currency or other currencies, including the euro. We are exposed to the economic, market and fiscal conditions in the United Kingdom and the EU and to changes in any of these conditions. We anticipate that current political and economic conditions in Europe may negatively impact revenue growth in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Consequently, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU could adversely impact our operating results, financial condition and prospects.
Because we conduct operations in China, risks associated with economic, political and social events in China could negatively affect our business and results of operations.
We operate a research and development center in Beijing, China and may continue to increase our presence in China. Our operations in China are subject to a number of risks relating to China’s economic and political systems, including:
•A government-controlled foreign exchange rate and limitations on the convertibility of the Chinese Renminbi;
•Uncertainty regarding the validity, enforceability and scope of protection for intellectual property rights and the practical difficulties of enforcing such rights;
•Ability to secure our business proprietary information located in China from unauthorized acquisition;
•Extensive government regulation;
•Changing governmental policies relating to tax benefits available to foreign-owned businesses;
•A relatively uncertain legal system; and
•Instability related to continued economic, political and social reform.
Any actions and policies adopted by the government of the People’s Republic of China, particularly with regard to intellectual property rights, any prolonged slowdown in China’s economy, or increased restrictions related to the transfer of data pursuant to the Chinese Cyber Security Law could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Further, at various times during recent years, the United States and China have had disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the future between these two countries. Any political or trade controversy between the United States and China could adversely affect the U.S. and European economies and materially and adversely affect the market price of our ADSs, our business, financial position and financial performance.
Risks Related to Taxes
Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates, adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns, and other aspects of our international operations and structure could expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
We are subject to income taxes in France, the United States and other jurisdictions, and our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop, value and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in federal, state, or international tax laws and accounting principles. The tax laws applicable to our business are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions may aggressively interpret their laws in an effort to raise additional tax revenue. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm’s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, the valuation of intellectual property, or the tax treatment of subscription software companies, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. It is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken or may determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve our intended tax consequences and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. Further, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our condensed consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added, digital services, or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our financial results.
The various jurisdictions in which we have sales and operations have different rules and regulations governing sales and use, value added, digital services, and similar taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that change over time. Certain jurisdictions in which we did not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties, and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. For example, 
certain jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom and France, have introduced a digital services tax, which is generally a tax on gross revenue generated from users or customers located in those jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting similar laws. Any tax assessments, penalties and interest, or future requirements may adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on us going forward will effectively increase the cost of our products to our customers and might adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new customers in the areas in which such taxes are imposed.
Our ability to use our accumulated gross tax losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.
As of December 31, 2020, we had accumulated gross tax losses in various jurisdictions of $403.0 million, which may be utilized against future income taxes. Limitations imposed by the applicable jurisdictions on our ability to utilize accumulated gross tax losses could cause income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such accumulated gross tax losses to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such accumulated gross tax losses. Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our accumulated gross tax losses before they expire. If any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our accumulated gross tax losses.
Our failure to maintain certain tax benefits applicable to French technology companies may adversely affect our results of operations.
As a French technology company, we have benefited from certain tax advantages, including, for example, the French research tax credit (crédit d’impôt recherche), or CIR. The CIR is a French tax credit aimed at stimulating research and development. The CIR can be offset against French corporate income tax due and the portion in excess (if any) may be refunded at the end of a three fiscal-year period, subject to certain conditions. The CIR is reflected as an offset to our research and development expense. It is calculated based on our claimed amount of eligible research and development expenditures in France and represented $0.5 million for 2020, $0.5 million for 2019, $0.5 million for 2018. The French tax authority with the assistance of the Research and Technology Ministry may audit each research and development program in respect of which a CIR benefit has been claimed and assess whether such program qualifies in their view for the CIR benefit, in accordance with the French tax code (Code général des impôts) and the relevant official guidelines. If the French tax authority determines that our research and development programs do not meet the requirements for the CIR benefit, or that certain CIR rules were inconsistently applied, we could be liable for additional corporate tax, and penalties and interest related thereto, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations and future cash flows. Furthermore, if the French Parliament decides to eliminate, or reduce the scope or the rate of, the CIR benefit, either of which it could decide to do at any time, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
Risks Related to Accounting Practices, Policies, and Standards
If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of the ADSs or ordinary shares.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our ADSs or ordinary shares. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition (including allocation of the transaction price to separate performance obligations), the amortization period for deferred commissions, fair value of acquired intangible assets, goodwill impairment test and measurement of share-based compensation.
If we fail to establish or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of the ADSs and ordinary shares may, therefore, be adversely affected.
As a public company in the United States, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. In addition, we are required to provide a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This process is time-consuming, costly and complicated. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. As described in more detail in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 17, 2020, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. Management determined such material weakness was remediated as of December 31, 2020. If the additional controls and processes we have implemented to remediate the material weakness prove to be insufficient or if we identify other control deficiencies that individually or in the aggregate constitute a material weaknesses, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. We could also be subject to litigation and investigations. In addition, the timing of our financial reporting could be adversely affected and we may be unable to timely file periodic reports in accordance with the requirements of federal securities laws and NASDAQ listing requirements. If we fail to report our results in a timely manner, we could be required to pay additional interest under our convertible notes. Any of the foregoing could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our ADSs and ordinary shares and possibly impact our ability to obtain future financing on acceptable terms.
An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and shareholders’ equity.
As of December 31, 2020, we had goodwill of $50.3 million and net intangible assets of $9.2 million, which in the aggregate represent 14% of our total consolidated assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but we evaluate for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Intangible assets are amortized, and we review the net carrying value for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable. Factors that could indicate that our goodwill or net intangible assets are impaired include, but are not limited to, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization; lower than projected sales growth rates, operating results and cash flows; slower growth rate in our industry; and a change in weighted average cost of capital or economic or market conditions. Some of these factors are outside of our control. In the future we may be required to record significant charges in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which we determine that our goodwill or net intangible assets are impaired. Any impairment charge may have an adverse effect on our results of operation and shareholders’ equity.
Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP. GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, the adoption of ASC 842 in 2019 has had and continues to have a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheet and the adoption of ASC 606 previously required us to change how we recognize revenue from term-based deployed subscription licenses. Further, the interpretation of these new standards may continue to evolve as other public companies adopt the new guidance and the standard setters issue new interpretative guidance related to these rules. New accounting pronouncements, changes in accounting principles, and changes in the interpretation of these rules have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future, which could adversely affect our financial results. Any difficulties in implementing these pronouncements could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors’ confidence in us.
Risks Related to Our Convertible Senior Notes
We have incurred substantial indebtedness that may decrease our business flexibility, access to capital, and/or increase our borrowing costs, and we may still incur substantially more debt, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results.
In September 2019, we issued €139.8 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes. Further, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the 2024 Notes, which we refer to as the indenture, from incurring additional indebtedness, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions to increase our debt levels. Our indebtedness may:
•limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;
•limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;
•require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments, including the 2024 Notes;
•limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;
•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and
•increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions
Servicing our debt, including the 2024 Notes, will require a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2024 Notes in cash or to repurchase the 2024 Notes upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the amounts payable under the 2024 Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our indebtedness, including the 2024 Notes, and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any of our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.
Further, holders of the 2024 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes upon the occurrence of a “fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture for the 2024 Notes) before the maturity date at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely ADSs to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2024 Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of 2024 Notes surrendered therefor upon a fundamental change or pay cash with respect to 2024 Notes being converted in lieu of delivering ADSs upon conversion.
In addition, our ability to repurchase the 2024 Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2024 Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase 2024 Notes when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2024 Notes as required by the indenture could constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the payment of such related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase 2024 Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2024 Notes.
While our 2024 Notes are denominated in euros, we may hold a significant portion of the proceeds in U.S. dollars and our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, which subjects us to both foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Our 2024 Notes are denominated in euros and the majority of the proceeds are held in euros as of December 31, 2020. As a result, our cash and short-term investments held in euros are potentially exposed to negative interest rates in Europe, which may negatively impact our net income. In addition, we may choose to hold a significant amount of the proceeds from our 2024 Notes in U.S. dollars in the future. A weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro could therefore adversely affect our ability to service our debt obligations and repay the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes if we are obligated to repurchase the 2024 Notes in the event of a fundamental change or deliver cash at maturity or upon conversion of the 2024 Notes to the extent that the 2024 Notes are not converted solely into our ADSs. In addition, because our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro would increase the amount of debt under our 2024 Notes that would be reportable on our balance sheet, which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.
In the future, we may enter into contractual arrangements designed to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with any non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt. If these hedging arrangements are unsuccessful, we may experience an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
The conditional conversion feature of the 2024 Notes, when triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
In the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2024 Notes is triggered, holders of the 2024 Notes will be entitled to convert their 2024 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2024 Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely ADSs (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity.
In addition, even if holders of 2024 Notes do not elect to convert their 2024 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2024 Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.
The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 2024 Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.
Under Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, or ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the 2024 Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the 2024 Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders’ equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2024 Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the 2024 Notes to their face amount over the term of the 2024 Notes. We report larger net losses (or lower net income) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instrument’s non-convertible coupon interest rate, which lowers our reported financial results, and could adversely affect the trading price of our ADSs and the trading price of the 2024 Notes. As of January 1, 2022, we will be adopting FASB ASU 2020-06. Under this new standard, the equity component of our convertible debt will be reclassified to a liability and we will no longer amortize the discounted carrying value of the 2024 Notes.
In addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the 2024 Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash may be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of such 2024 Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of such 2024 Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. If we are unable or otherwise elect not to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, then our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.
Conversion of the 2024 Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders or may otherwise depress the price of our ADSs and ordinary shares.
The conversion of some or all of the 2024 Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders to the extent we deliver ADSs upon conversion of any of the 2024 Notes. The 2024 Notes may from time to time in the future be convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances specified in the indenture for the 2024 Notes. Moreover, because our ADSs trade in U.S. dollars but the conversion rate and conversion price set forth in the indenture for the 2024 Notes are set forth in euros, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar-euro exchange rate could cause the 2024 Notes to be convertible and result in dilution to our shareholders even if our ADSs do not significantly appreciate in value or appreciate in value at all. For example, one situation in which the 2024 Notes are convertible is when, during any calendar quarter ending after December 31, 2019, the last reported sale price of our ADS (converted into euros in the manner set forth in the indenture for the 2024 Notes) for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than 130% of the conversion price of the 2024 Notes on each applicable trading day. As a result, if the U.S. dollar strengthened sufficiently against the euro, that conversion condition could be satisfied even if our ADSs do not appreciate in value.
Any sales in the public market of the ADSs (or ordinary shares represented by such ADS) issuable upon any conversion of the 2024 Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our ADSs and ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the 2024 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2024 Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the 2024 Notes into ADSs could depress the price of our ADSs and ordinary shares.
Provisions in the indenture for our 2024 Notes could discourage or make more difficult certain corporate actions.
Provisions in the indenture for our 2024 Notes could discourage or make more difficult certain corporate actions. For example, if a “fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture for the 2024 Notes) occurs prior to the maturity date of the 2024 Notes, holders of the 2024 Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes. If a “make-whole fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture for the 2024 Notes) occurs prior the maturity date, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate of the 2024 Notes for a holder that elects to convert its 2024 Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Furthermore, the indenture for the 2024 Notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions or sales of assets unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the 2024 Notes.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Ordinary Shares and ADSs
The market price for our ADSs has been and may be volatile or may decline.
The stock markets, and securities of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. We believe that our stock is particularly susceptible to high volatility due to liquidity constraints and our average daily trading volume as a result of our ADS program. In the past, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the market price of our ADSs has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control.
Substantial future sales or perceived potential sales of our ADSs, ordinary shares, or other securities in the public market could cause the price of our ADSs to decline significantly.
The price of our ADSs and ordinary shares could decline significantly if there are substantial sales of our ADSs, ordinary shares, or other equity securities in the public market (or the perception that these sales could occur), particularly by our directors, executive officers, and significant shareholders. We believe this risk is greater due to liquidity constraints and our average daily trading volume as a result of our ADS program. The shares held by these persons may be sold in the public market in the United States, subject to prior registration in the United States, if required, or reliance upon an exemption from United States registration, including, in the case of shares held by affiliates or control persons, compliance with the volume restrictions of Rule 144. In 
addition, certain of our executive officers have entered into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans under which they have contracted with a broker to sell shares of our ADSs on a periodic basis.
Furthermore, we have reserved a significant number of ADSs (and ordinary shares underlying the ADSs) for issuance in connection with awards issued under our equity incentive plans, employee stock purchase program and upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, the issuance of which will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders. Any sales in the public market of the ADSs issuable upon such issuance or conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our ADSs.
We may also issue ordinary shares or securities convertible into our ordinary shares from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing holders and could cause the market price of our ADSs to decline significantly.
The requirements of being a public company in the United States, particularly while being domiciled in France, may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.
Although we are domiciled in France, we are considered a U.S. domestic issuer under U.S. federal securities laws and regulations and are required to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy materials and registration statements on U.S. domestic issuer forms with the SEC.
We are required under current SEC rules to prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP and our executive officers and directors are also subject to the reporting and “short-swing” profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and related rules with respect to their purchases and sales of our securities. As a French domiciled company, we are also required to prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and standalone financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in France, each of which are subject to shareholder approval at our annual general meeting of shareholders. We expect that our status as a publicly traded company subject to U.S. domestic issuer requirements, together with our status as a French domiciled company, will require significant attention from management and may further strain our resources and cause us to incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses.
Additionally, as a public company in the United States, we have incurred and will continue to incur legal, accounting and other expenses. We are subject to the Exchange Act, including certain of the reporting requirements thereunder, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ, enhanced legal and regulatory regimes and heightened standards relating to corporate governance and disclosure for public companies, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increases demand on our systems and resources. Being both a public company in the United States and a French domiciled company also has an impact on disclosure of information and requires compliance with two sets of applicable rules. This could result in uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by legal analysis of dual legal regimes.
Share ownership is concentrated in the hands of certain large shareholders and management, who are able to exercise a direct or indirect controlling influence on us.
Our executive officers, directors, current five percent or greater shareholders and affiliated entities together beneficially own a significant percentage of our ordinary shares and ADSs outstanding as of December 31, 2020. As a result, these shareholders, acting together or in parallel, could have a significant influence over all matters that require approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate action might be taken even if other shareholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other shareholders may view as beneficial.
Holders of our ADSs do not directly hold our ordinary shares.
As an ADS holder, you are not treated as one of our shareholders and you do not have ordinary shareholder rights. French law governs shareholder rights. The depositary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is the holder of the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs. As a holder of ADSs, you have ADS holder rights. The deposit agreement among us, the depositary and you, as an ADS 
holder, and all other persons directly and indirectly holding ADSs, sets out ADS holder rights, as well as the rights and obligations of the depositary.
You may not be able to exercise your right to vote the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs.
Holders of ADSs may exercise voting rights with respect to the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs only in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement and not as a direct shareholder. The deposit agreement provides that, upon receipt of notice of any meeting of holders of our ordinary shares, the depositary will fix a record date for the determination of ADS holders who shall be entitled to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights. Upon timely receipt of notice from us, if we so request, the depositary shall distribute to the holders as of the record date (1) the notice of the meeting or solicitation of consent or proxy sent by us and (2) a statement as to the manner in which instructions may be given by the holders.
You may instruct the depositary to vote the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs. Otherwise, you will not be able to exercise your right to vote, unless you withdraw the ordinary shares underlying the ADSs you hold. However, you may not know about the meeting far enough in advance to withdraw those ordinary shares. If we ask for your instructions, the depositary, upon timely notice from us, will notify you of the upcoming vote and arrange to deliver our voting materials to you. We cannot guarantee you that you will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary to vote your ordinary shares or to withdraw your ordinary shares so that you can vote them yourself. If the depositary does not receive timely voting instructions from you, it may give a proxy to a person designated by us to vote the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs in accordance with the recommendation of our board of directors. In addition, the depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions. This means that you may not be able to exercise your right to vote through the depositary, and there may be nothing you can do if the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs are not voted as you requested.
You may be subject to limitations on the transfer of your ADSs and the withdrawal of the underlying ordinary shares.
Your ADSs, which may be evidenced by American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs, are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. The depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of your ADSs generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary think it is advisable to do so because of any requirement of law, government or governmental body, or under any provision of the deposit agreement, or for any other reason subject to your right to cancel your ADSs and withdraw the underlying ordinary shares. Temporary delays in the cancellation of your ADSs and withdrawal of the underlying ordinary shares may arise because the depositary has closed its transfer books or we have closed our transfer books, the transfer of ordinary shares is blocked to permit voting at a shareholders’ meeting or we are paying a dividend on our ordinary shares. In addition, you may not be able to cancel your ADSs and withdraw the underlying ordinary shares when you owe money for fees, taxes and similar charges and when it is necessary to prohibit withdrawals in order to comply with any laws or governmental regulations that apply to ADSs or to the withdrawal of ordinary shares or other deposited securities. For example, if changes are made to tax laws, our securities may then be subject to French or other applicable taxes.
Risks Related to Investing in a French Company
Provisions in our By-laws and French corporate law may delay or discourage a takeover attempt.
Provisions contained in our By-laws, and the corporate laws of France, the country in which we are incorporated, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders. In addition, provisions of French law and our By-laws impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions. These provisions include the following:
•Provisions of French law allowing the owner of 90% of the share capital or voting rights of a public company to force out the minority shareholders following a tender offer made to all shareholders are only applicable to companies listed on a regulated market in a Member State of the European Union or in another state party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, including the main French stock exchange and will therefore not be applicable to us, unless we dual-list on such regulated market;
•A merger (i.e., in a French law context, a stock-for-stock exchange after which our company would be dissolved without being liquidated into the acquiring entity and our shareholders would become shareholders of the acquiring 
entity) of our company into a company incorporated in the European Union would require the approval of our board of directors as well as a two-thirds majority of the votes held by the shareholders present, represented by proxy or voting by mail at the relevant meeting;
•A merger of our company into a company incorporated outside of the European Union would require the unanimous approval of our shareholders;
•Under French law, a cash merger is treated as a share purchase and would require the consent of each participating shareholder;
•Our shareholders have granted and may grant in the future our board of directors’ broad authorizations to increase our share capital or to issue additional ordinary shares or other securities (for example, warrants) to our shareholders, the public or qualified investors;
•Our shareholders have preferential subscription rights proportional to their shareholding in our company on the issuance by us of any additional shares or securities giving the right, immediately or in the future, to new shares for cash or a set-off of cash debts, which rights may only be waived by the extraordinary general meeting (by a two-thirds majority vote) of our shareholders or on an individual basis by each shareholder;
•Our board of directors has the right to appoint directors to fill a vacancy created by the resignation or death of a director, subject to the approval by the shareholders of such appointment at the next ordinary shareholders’ meeting, which prevents shareholders from having the sole right to fill vacancies on our board of directors;
•Our board of directors can only be convened by its chairman or, when no board meeting has been held for more than two consecutive months, by directors representing at least one-third of the total number of directors;
•Our board of directors’ meetings can only be regularly held if at least half of the directors attend either physically or by way of videoconference or teleconference enabling the directors’ identification and ensuring their effective participation in the board of directors’ decisions;
•Under French law, any non-French citizen, any French citizen not residing in France, as well as any non-French entity or French entity controlled by one of the aforementioned persons or entities may have to file a declaration for statistical purposes with the Bank of France (Banque de France) within 20 working days following the date of certain direct foreign investments in us, including any purchase of our ADSs. In particular, such filings are required in connection with investments exceeding €15,000,000 that lead to the acquisition of at least 10% of our share capital or voting rights or cross such 10% threshold;
•Under French law, certain investments in a French company relating to certain strategic industries and activities (such as data processing, transmission or storage activities) by individuals or entities not French, not resident in France or controlled by entities not French or not residing in France are subject to prior authorization of the Ministry of Economy;
•Approval of at least a majority of the votes held by shareholders present, represented by a proxy, or voting by mail at the relevant ordinary shareholders’ general meeting is required to remove directors with or without cause;
•Advance notice is required for nominations to the board of directors or for proposing matters to be acted upon at a shareholders’ meeting, except that a vote to remove and replace a director can be proposed at any shareholders’ meeting without notice;
•Pursuant to French law, our By-laws, including the sections relating to the number of directors and election and removal of a director from office, may only be modified by a resolution adopted by a two-thirds majority vote of our shareholders present, represented by a proxy or voting by mail at the meeting; and
•Our shares take the form of bearer securities or registered securities, if applicable legislation so permits, according to the shareholder’s choice. Issued shares are represented by book entries in individual accounts opened with us or an authorized intermediary on our behalf or any authorized intermediary (depending on the form of such shares), in the name of each shareholder or registered intermediary and kept according to the terms and conditions laid down by the legal and regulatory provisions and, in the case of an authorized or registered intermediary, contractual provisions.
Your right as a holder of ADSs to participate in any future preferential subscription rights or to elect to receive dividends in shares may be limited, which may cause dilution to your holdings.
According to French law, if we issue additional shares or securities for cash giving right, immediately or in the future, to new shares, current shareholders will have preferential subscription rights for these securities proportionally to their shareholding in our company unless they waive those rights at an extraordinary meeting of our shareholders (by a two-thirds majority vote) or individually by each shareholder. However, our ADS holders in the United States will not be entitled to exercise or sell such rights unless we register the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements is available. In addition, the deposit agreement provides that the depositary will not make rights available to you unless the distribution to ADS holders of both the rights and any related securities are either registered under the 
Securities Act or exempted from registration under the Securities Act. Further, if we offer holders of our ordinary shares the option to receive dividends in either cash or shares, under the deposit agreement the depositary may require satisfactory assurances from us that extending the offer to holders of ADSs does not require registration of any securities under the Securities Act before making the option available to holders of ADSs. We are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective. Moreover, we may not be able to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, ADS holders may be unable to participate in our rights offerings or to elect to receive dividends in shares and may experience dilution in their holdings. In addition, if the depositary is unable to sell rights that are not exercised or not distributed or if the sale is not lawful or reasonably practicable, it will allow the rights to lapse, in which case you will receive no value for these rights.
U.S. investors may have difficulty enforcing civil liabilities against our company and directors and the experts named in our annual report.
Certain members of our board of directors and certain of our subsidiaries and certain experts named in this Annual Report are non-residents of the United States, and all of or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible to serve process on such persons or us in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.
Additionally, it may be difficult to assert U.S. securities law claims in actions originally instituted outside of the United States. Foreign courts may refuse to hear a U.S. securities law claim because foreign courts may not be the most appropriate forums in which to bring such a claim. Even if a foreign court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that the law of the jurisdiction in which the foreign court resides, and not U.S. law, is applicable to the claim. Further, if U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process, and certain matters of procedure would still be governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the foreign court resides. In particular, there is some doubt as to whether French courts would recognize and enforce certain civil liabilities under U.S. securities laws in original actions or judgments of U.S. courts based upon these civil liability provisions. In addition, awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may be unenforceable in France. An award for monetary damages under the U.S. securities laws would be considered punitive if it does not seek to compensate the claimant for loss or damage suffered but is intended to punish the defendant. French law provides that a shareholder, or a group of shareholders, may initiate a legal action to seek indemnification from the directors of a corporation in the corporation’s interest if it fails to bring such legal action itself. If so, any damages awarded by the court are paid to the corporation and any legal fees relating to such action are borne by the relevant shareholder or the group of shareholders.
The enforceability of any judgment in France will depend on the particular facts of the case as well as the laws and treaties in effect at the time. The United States and France do not currently have a treaty providing for recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, the recognition and enforcement of any such judgment would be subject to French procedural law and a French court may not recognize or enforce any such judgment.
We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our securities, and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment depends on appreciation in the price of the ADSs and ordinary shares. In addition, French law may limit the amount of dividends we are able to distribute.
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. In addition, any future indebtedness may restrict our ability to pay dividends. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your ADSs or ordinary shares for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in our ADSs and ordinary shares will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. Consequently, investors in our ADSs and ordinary shares may need to rely on sales of all or part of their holdings of ADSs and ordinary shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. There is no guarantee that the ADSs or ordinary shares will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our shareholders have purchased the ADSs or ordinary shares. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase the ADSs or ordinary shares.
Further, under French law, the determination of whether we have been sufficiently profitable to pay dividends is made on the basis of our statutory financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with French generally accepted accounting 
principles. In addition, payment of dividends may subject us to additional taxes under French law. Therefore, we may be more restricted in our ability to declare dividends than companies not based in France.
In addition, exchange rate fluctuations may affect the amount of euros that we are able to distribute, and the amount in U.S. dollars that our shareholders receive upon the payment of cash dividends or other distributions we declare and pay in euros, if any. These factors could harm the value of the ADSs and ordinary shares, and, in turn, the U.S. dollar proceeds that holders receive from the sale of the ADSs and ordinary shares.
United States persons who hold our ADSs may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company.
A non-U.S. corporation will be considered a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, for any taxable year if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income or (2) at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets during such year) is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. Based on the historical and present value and composition of our assets we do not believe we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2020, and we do not expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year or in the foreseeable future. Because a separate factual determination as to whether we are or have become a PFIC must be made each year (after the close of such year), we could be or become a PFIC in the current year or any future taxable year. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a United States person holds ADSs or ordinary shares, the United States person may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including (1) the treatment of all or a portion of any gain on disposition as ordinary income, (2) the application of an interest charge with respect to such gain and certain dividends and (3) compliance with certain reporting requirements. Each United States person who holds our ADSs is strongly urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the application of these rules and the availability of any potential elections.
If a United States person is treated as owning at least 10% of our ADSs, such person may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.
If a United States person is treated as owning (directly, indirectly, or constructively) at least 10% of the value or voting power of our ADSs, such person may be treated as a “United States shareholder” with respect to each “controlled foreign corporation” in our group (if any). Because our group includes one or more U.S. subsidiaries, certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries could be treated as controlled foreign corporations (regardless of whether or not we are treated as a controlled foreign corporation). A United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may be required to report annually and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of “Subpart F income,” “global intangible low-taxed income,” and investments in U.S. property by controlled foreign corporations, regardless of whether we make any distributions. Failure to comply with such reporting requirements could result in adverse tax effects for United States shareholders and potentially significant monetary penalties. An individual that is a United States shareholder with respect to a controlled foreign corporation generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a United States shareholder that is a U.S. corporation. We cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors in determining whether any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is treated as a controlled foreign corporation or furnish to any United States shareholders information that may be necessary to comply with the aforementioned obligations. A United States investor should consult its advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to an investment in our ADSs and ordinary shares.
The rights of shareholders in companies subject to French corporate law differ in material respects from the rights of shareholders of corporations incorporated in the United States.
We are a French company with limited liability. Our corporate affairs are governed by our By-laws and by the laws governing companies incorporated in France. The rights of shareholders and the responsibilities of members of our board of directors are in many ways different from the rights and obligations of shareholders in companies governed by the laws of U.S. jurisdictions. For example, in the performance of its duties, our board is required by French law to consider the interests of our company, its shareholders, its employees and other stakeholders, rather than solely our shareholders and/or creditors. It is possible that some of these parties will have interests that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder.
