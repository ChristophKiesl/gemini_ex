ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 We are a pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs that treat severe metabolic, oncologic and psychiatric disorders by modulating the effects of cortisol. Elevated levels and abnormal release patterns of cortisol are implicated in a broad range of human disorders. Since our inception in 1998, we have been developing mifepristone, a compound that modulates the effects of cortisol by acting as a competitive antagonist at the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We have also discovered three structurally distinct series of proprietary, selective cortisol modulators, all of which share mifepristone’s affinity for GR but, unlike mifepristone, do not bind to the progesterone receptor and so do not cause effects associated with progesterone receptor affinity. Development of the lead compounds from these series is in progress.

In 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Korlym® (mifepristone) 300 mg Tablets as a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery.
 We are conducting two clinical trials of our proprietary selective cortisol modulator, CORT125134. One trial is investigating CORT125134 as a potential treatment for patients with Cushing syndrome. The second trial is investigating the combination of CORT125134 and nab-paclitaxel (Celgene Corporation’s Abraxane®) to treat patients with solid-tumor cancers.  These trials are enrolling patients.
 We plan to begin clinical trials of two other selective cortisol modulators in 2017.
 The Role of Cortisol in Disease
 Cortisol is a steroid hormone that plays a significant role in the way the body reacts to stressful conditions. It influences metabolism and the immune system and contributes to emotional stability. It is essential for survival. Insufficient cortisol activity may lead to dehydration, hypotension, shock, fatigue, low resistance to infection, trauma, stress and hypoglycemia. Excessive cortisol activity may lead to a suppressed immune response, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, obesity, fatty liver disease, depressed mood, psychosis, wasting of the arms and legs, edema, fatigue, hypertension and other problems. Pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that cortisol may reduce a patient’s immune response to oncogenesis and shield certain cancer cells from the apoptotic effects of chemotherapy. 
 The challenge in regulating excessive levels of cortisol is that destroying the ability of the body to make cortisol can cause serious harm. An effective medication must modulate cortisol’s effects without suppressing them below normal levels or disrupting the body’s normal cortisol rhythm, in which cortisol levels rise at awakening and decrease during the day. The action of cortisol can effectively be modulated by the use of compounds that compete with cortisol as it attempts to bind to GR. Mifepristone, the active ingredient in Korlym, is a competitive GR antagonist, as are Corcept’s proprietary compounds.
 Because mifepristone works by reducing the binding of excess cortisol to GR, it can modulate the effects of abnormal levels and release patterns of cortisol without compromising cortisol’s necessary, normal functions and rhythms. However, mifepristone also binds to the progesterone receptor and thereby terminates pregnancy and sometimes causes other side effects, including irregular vaginal bleeding. Our selective cortisol modulators block GR as potently as mifepristone does, but have no affinity for the progesterone receptor and so do not cause progesterone receptor-related side effects.
 Cushing Syndrome
 Background. Cushing syndrome is caused by prolonged exposure of the body’s tissues to high levels of cortisol. It is relatively uncommon and most often affects adults aged 20 to 50. An estimated 10 to 15 of every one million people are newly diagnosed with this syndrome each year, resulting in approximately 3,000 new patients and an estimated total of 20,000 patients with Cushing syndrome in the United States.
 Symptoms vary, but most people with Cushing syndrome have one or more of the following manifestations: high blood sugar, diabetes, high blood pressure, upper body obesity, rounded face, increased fat around the neck, thinning arms and legs, severe fatigue and weak muscles. Irritability, anxiety, cognitive disturbances and depression are also common. Cushing syndrome can affect every organ system in the body and can be lethal if not treated. The preferred treatment for Cushing syndrome patients is surgery, which, if successful, can cure the disease. Depending on the type of tumor, surgery can result in a range of complications and has varying rates of success. In approximately half of the patients, surgery is not successful because the tumor cannot be located or removed completely. 
 Korlym to Treat Patients with Cushing Syndrome. We have received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for Korlym in the treatment of patients with endogenous Cushing syndrome. Drugs that receive Orphan Drug 
 2

designation receive seven years of marketing exclusivity for the approved indication, as well as tax credits for clinical trial costs, marketing application filing fee waivers and assistance from the FDA in the drug development process.
 We first made Korlym available to patients on a commercial basis in April 2012. We sell Korlym using experienced sales representatives, who target U.S. endocrinologists who care for a large portion of the patients with Cushing syndrome. In addition, we have a field-based force of medical science liaisons. We also reach patients directly through web-based initiatives and interactions with patient groups. Because a large percentage of the people who suffer from Cushing syndrome remain undiagnosed or are inadequately treated, we have developed and continue to refine and expand programs to educate the medical community and patients about diagnosis of this syndrome and to increase awareness regarding the role of cortisol modulators to treat the disease. 
 We use a specialty pharmacy and a specialty distributor to distribute Korlym and provide logistical support. We have retained a vendor to help patients with the reimbursement process and to administer our financial assistance programs for uninsured or under-insured patients. We also donate money to independent charitable foundations. These organizations, along with our own programs, help us ensure that no Cushing syndrome patient is denied access to Korlym for financial reasons.
 CORT125134 to Treat Patients with Cushing Syndrome. We are enrolling patients in a Phase 2 trial of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulator, CORT125134, to treat patients with Cushing syndrome. CORT125134 shares Korlym’s affinity for GR. Data from the compound’s Phase 1 trial showed that it potently modulates the effects of the steroid prednisone, a commonly-used GR agonist. Modulating the effect of prednisone is important because it is a strong surrogate for Korlym’s modulation of cortisol – the essential quality of an effective treatment for patients with Cushing syndrome. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that CORT125134 is suitable for once-daily oral dosing. We expect to have data from this trial by the end of 2017.
 FKBP5 Gene Expression.  We are developing a CLIA-validated assay to measure expression of the gene FKBP5, which is stimulated by cortisol activity at GR. Our hypothesis is that FKBP5 expression increases in patients with Cushing syndrome and falls as their disease is treated. If our hypothesis is correct, our assay would allow physicians to measure the degree to which their patients suffer from excess cortisol activity – the cause of Cushing syndrome – which would help them more easily identify patients with the disease and better treat those already in their care. 
 Oncology
 There is substantial in vitro, in vivo and clinical evidence that cortisol’s activity allows certain solid-tumor cancers to resist treatment. In some cancers, cortisol activity promotes tumor growth. Cortisol also stimulates genes that retard cellular apoptosis. 
 Our oncology development program also seeks to exploit a second mechanism. Cortisol suppresses the body's immune response. Suppression of the immune response is often beneficial, as it lessens the frequency of autoimmune diseases. However, activating, not suppressing, the body's immune system is beneficial in fighting certain cancers. Our hypothesis is that adding a cortisol modulator to a treatment regimen will help the patient’s immune system combat the disease.
 A range of tumor-types express GR and are potential targets for cortisol modulation therapy, among them triple-negative breast, ovarian, castration-resistant prostate, cervical and pancreatic cancer, as well as sarcoma and melanoma.
 Korlym to Treat Patients with Solid-Tumor Cancers. In December 2016, we announced the results of our Phase 1/2 trial of Korlym in combination with eribulin (Eisai’s Inc.’s drug, Halaven®) to treat patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.  The trial studied 21 patients with GR positive tumors, one with GR negative tumors and one with tumors whose GR status was not known. As determined using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), efficacy results were as follows: four patients exhibited a partial response, defined as a 30 percent or greater reduction in tumor size; eight had stable disease; and 11 had progressive 
 3

disease. Six patients achieved progression-free survival (PFS) longer than the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for PFS (15 weeks) in patients receiving Halaven® monotherapy in a comparable population (Aogi et al., Annals of Oncology 23: 1441-1448, 2012). Median PFS in the trial was 11.1 weeks – compared to 7.2 weeks in the Halaven monotherapy study reported by Aogi. We believe that the addition of Korlym to chemotherapy warrants further study, such as the double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, University of Chicago-led trial described above that Celgene is funding.
 Korlym to Treat Patients with Triple-Negative Breast Cancer and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.  Investigators at the University of Chicago have initiated a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 2 study of Korlym in combination with Celgene’s drug Abraxane to treat 64 patients with advanced, GR-positive triple-negative breast cancer. Celgene is funding the trial. We are providing Korlym. University of Chicago investigators are also leading a controlled, multicenter Phase 2 study of Korlym combined with the androgen deprivation agent enzalutamide (Astellas Pharma Inc.’s drug, Xtandi®) versus Xtandi monotherapy to treat 84 patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.  The investigators’ hypothesis is that adding cortisol modulation to androgen deprivation therapy will better suppress tumor growth. The Department of Defense and the Prostate Cancer Foundation are funding the trial. Astellas is providing Xtandi. We are providing Korlym.
 We have exclusively licensed patents from the University of Chicago covering the use of cortisol modulators in combination with anti-cancer agents to treat triple-negative breast cancer and with androgen deprivation agents to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer.
 CORT125134 to Treat Patients with Solid-Tumor Cancers. We are conducting a Phase 1/2 trial of Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) in combination with CORT125134 to treat any solid-tumor cancer suitable for treatment with Abraxane. Once we identify a recommended dose of this combination, we will open 20-patient cohorts to test the combination’s efficacy in one or more solid-tumor cancers. Our likely initial targets will be triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer.  Other possible indications include pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer and sarcoma. We may choose to open additional dose-finding cohorts to study CORT125134 in combination with different companion therapeutic agents, including immunotherapy, to treat other solid-tumor cancers.
 Development of Our Other Selective Cortisol Modulators
 CORT125134 is the lead compound in our portfolio of proprietary selective cortisol modulators, which consists of three structurally distinct series. All of these compounds, like Korlym, potently block GR but do not block the progesterone, estrogen or androgen receptors. In addition to our findings with CORT125134, several of our new compounds have demonstrated positive results in animal or in vitro models that test cortisol modulation. We are advancing the most promising of these compounds towards the clinic and expect to begin clinical trials of CORT118335 and CORT125281 in 2017. CORT118335 is a potential medication for fatty-liver disease, anti-psychotic-induced weight gain and other metabolic disorders. CORT125281 is a candidate for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (in combination with an androgen-deprivation agent such as Xtandi) and other indications.  
 The United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO) have issued to us composition of matter patents related to our selective cortisol modulators.  In addition, we own or have exclusively licensed patents for the use of all cortisol modulators (including Korlym) in a broad range of disorders.  See “Business – Intellectual Property.”
 We intend to continue our discovery research program with the goal of identifying new selective cortisol modulators, to manufacture and conduct pre-clinical development of one or more of these compounds and to study the most promising of them in humans.
Studies by Independent Investigators
 We have, for many years, sought to advance our understanding of cortisol modulation’s therapeutic potential by supporting the work of independent academic investigators. These researchers have studied the utility of our proprietary selective cortisol modulators in pre-clinical studies in a wide range of disorders, including post-traumatic 
 4

stress disorder, alcoholism, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, muscular dystrophy, Cushing syndrome, metabolic syndrome, fatty liver disease, ovarian cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer and triple-negative breast cancer.
 Clinical Trial Agreements 
 Some of our clinical trials are conducted through the use of clinical research organizations (CROs). Our Phase 2 trial of CORT125134 for the treatment of patients with Cushing syndrome is being conducted under an agreement with Chiltern International Limited (Chiltern). This agreement may be terminated by us upon 60-days written notice to Chiltern or sooner if the parties mutually agree. 
Research and Development Spending
 We incurred $23.8 million, $15.4 million and $18.4 million of research and development expenses in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, which accounted for 33%, 29% and 34%, respectively of our total operating expenses in those years. 
Manufacturing Korlym
 We do not have manufacturing capabilities and intend to continue to rely on experienced contract manufacturers to produce Korlym and our product candidates. We have a long-term agreement with one contract manufacturer, Produits Chimiques Auxiliaires et de Synthese SA (PCAS), to produce mifepristone, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for Korlym, pursuant to which we agree to purchase a minimum percentage of our mifepristone requirements.   The initial term of the agreement is five years, with an automatic extension of one year, unless either party gives 12-months prior written termination notice. We have the right to terminate the agreement if PCAS is unable to manufacture mifepristone for nine consecutive months. 
 We have one tablet manufacturer for Korlym – Alcami Corporation (formerly known as AAI Pharma Services Corp., or AAI). In April 2014, we entered into an agreement with Alcami for the manufacture and packaging of Korlym tablets. The initial term of this agreement is three years, with consecutive automatic extensions of two years, unless either party gives written termination notice (in the case of Alcami, 18 months prior to the end of the applicable term; in our case, 12 months prior to the end of the applicable term). We have the right to terminate the agreement if (i) Alcami is unable to manufacture our product for four consecutive months or (ii) our product is withdrawn from the market. We have no minimum purchase obligations under this agreement.
 Competition for Korlym
 Korlym competes with established treatments, including surgery, radiation and other medications, including “off-label” uses of drugs such as ketoconazole, an anti-fungal medication. Korlym also competes with Novartis’ drug, Signifor® (pasireotide) Injection, which the FDA approved in December 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing disease who are not candidates for pituitary surgery or for whom surgery did not work. (Cushing disease is a subset of Cushing syndrome that afflicts approximately 70 percent of patients with Cushing syndrome.)
 Korlym may also experience competition from compounds under development for Cushing syndrome. For example, Strongbridge Biopharma plc has received Orphan Drug designation in the United States and the EU for the use of levoketoconazole, a chiral form of ketoconazole, to treat Cushing syndrome and has begun a Phase 3 clinical trial in Europe and the United States for this indication.
 Intellectual Property
 Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. It is our policy to seek patent protection for our inventions and to rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.

Mifepristone. The composition of matter patent covering mifepristone has expired. The only other FDA-approved use of mifepristone is to terminate pregnancy. The FDA has imposed significant restrictions on the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy. To protect our market for Korlym we plan to rely on (1) the exclusive marketing rights conferred as a benefit of Orphan Drug designation in the United States, (2) the restrictions imposed by the FDA on the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy, (3) the different patient populations, administering physicians and treatment settings between the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy and to treat Cushing syndrome and (4) our method of use patents described below.
 Oncology. We have an exclusive license agreement with the University of Chicago to patents covering the use of all cortisol modulators, including mifepristone, in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (in combination with anti-cancer agents) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (in combination with androgen deprivation agents). See “Business – License Agreements.”
 Other Method of Use Patents. We own issued U.S. patents for the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment, the prevention and treatment of stress disorders, improving the therapeutic response to electroconvulsive therapy, the treatment of delirium, the treatment of catatonia, the treatment of psychosis with Interferon-Alpha therapy, inhibiting cognitive deterioration in adults with Down’s Syndrome, the treatment of weight gain following treatment with antipsychotic medication, the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, the treatment of migraine headaches, the treatment of neurological damage in premature infants, and the treatment of diseases using combination steroid and GR antagonist therapy. We also own a method of use patent for optimizing mifepristone levels in plasma serum in patients suffering from mental disorders, including the mental disorders seen in Cushing syndrome. The expiration dates of these patents and their foreign counterparts range from 2020 to 2034.
 In addition, we have six U.S. method-of-use applications covering certain cortisol modulators, including the treatment of patients suffering from mental disorders by optimizing mifepristone absorption, and the treatment of patients suffering from muscular dystrophy and from ALS.
 We estimate that the expiration dates of the patents that could issue from these applications and their foreign counterparts range from 2029 to 2036.
 Composition of Matter Patents Covering Our Proprietary, Selective Cortisol Modulators. We have eight U.S. composition of matter patents containing claims relating to three structurally distinct series of next-generation cortisol modulators. Four of these patents have issued in Europe, with an additional U.S. application pending. The expiration dates of these patents and their foreign counterparts range from 2026 to 2033.
 We have also filed, where we deemed appropriate, foreign patent applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that any issued patent will include claims of the breadth sought in these applications, or that competitors or other third-parties will not successfully challenge or circumvent our patents if they are issued.
 We believe that our patents are valid and that we do not currently infringe any third-party’s patents or other proprietary rights, and we are not obligated to pay royalties relating to the use of intellectual property to any third-party other than Stanford University and the University of Chicago.
 License Agreements
 We have exclusively licensed three issued U.S. patents from Stanford University for the use of cortisol modulators, including mifepristone, in the treatment of psychotic depression, cocaine-induced psychosis and early dementia, including early Alzheimer’s disease. We are required to make milestone payments and pay royalties to Stanford University on sales of products commercialized under these patents. Milestone payments are creditable against future royalties. Our license will end upon expiration of the related patents in 2018 and 2019 or upon notification by us to Stanford. 
 We have also exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago two issued U.S. patents for the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer, and a second patent family consisting of an 
 6

issued U.S. patent and applications in Europe having claims directed to the use of cortisol modulators to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer. We are required to pay the University of Chicago customary milestone fees and royalties on revenue from products commercialized under the issued patents or patents that may issue pursuant to the pending applications. Our license will end upon expiration of the related patents in 2031 and 2033 or upon notification by us to the University of Chicago. 
 Government Regulation
 Prescription pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and post-approval regulation, including regulations that govern the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, and promotion of the products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. All of our product candidates require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing; submission of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug’s intended use; and approval by the FDA. The process of complying with these and other federal and state statutes and regulations involves significant time and expense.
 Preclinical studies are generally conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and the efficacy of a product. Drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies to the FDA as a part of an IND, which must be approved before beginning clinical trials in humans. If it is anticipated that the clinical trial will be conducted in Europe, a Clinical Trial Authorization (CTA) must be submitted and approved by the appropriate European regulatory agency prior to the commencement of the study. Typically, human clinical trials are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
  
• | Phase 1. Clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile and pharmacokinetics of the product candidate in human volunteers, and to provide early information about drug effectiveness and/or activity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with the targeted disease to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Large-scale, multi-center, trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the drug and to demonstrate with substantial evidence the efficacy and safety of the product.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA and the institutional review boards associated with clinical trial sites closely monitor the progress of clinical trials conducted in the United States and may reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to unacceptable risks. The FDA may also require that additional studies be conducted.
 After Phase 3 trials are completed, drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies, clinical trials, formulation studies and data supporting manufacturing to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Applications (“NDA”) for approval to begin commercial sales. The FDA reviews an NDA upon submission, and may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. If the FDA accepts an NDA for filing, it may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not meet the criteria for approval. Once an NDA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA has 180 days to examine the application and respond to the applicant. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to NDAs within ten months of the filing date for standard review, and six months for priority review if a sponsor shows that its drug candidate provides a significant benefit compared to marketed drugs. FDA approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
 If the FDA approves an NDA, the subject drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe in the United States. The FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained. The drug developer must submit periodic reports to the FDA. Adverse patient experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or removal 
 7

of the product from the market. Product approvals may be withdrawn if problems with safety or efficacy occur. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies, referred to as Phase 4 studies, to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-approval studies.
 Facilities involved in the manufacture of drugs are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other authorities where applicable, and must comply with FDA-mandated current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (cGMP). Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, or the seizure or recall of a product.
 The FDA imposes complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals.  These include standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, and industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. The FDA has broad enforcement authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Failure to abide by its regulations can result in penalties including the issuance of a warning letter directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and state and federal civil and criminal penalties.
 In addition to studies requested by the FDA after approval, a drug developer may conduct other preclinical and clinical trials investigating use of the approved compound to treat additional indications. Data supporting the use of a drug for new indications must be approved by the FDA before the drug can be marketed for these indications.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 We have received Orphan Drug designation for Korlym for the treatment of endogenous Cushing syndrome in the United States. Orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of the product for the tax credit and marketing incentives of the Orphan Drug Act, including seven years of exclusive marketing rights for the specific drug for the orphan indication, if it receives the first regulatory approval for that indication, with limited exceptions. A marketing application for a prescription drug product that has been designated as a drug for a rare disease or condition is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. Orphan Drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for an indication. It also does not convey an advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the review and approval process for a drug.
Marketing Approvals Outside the United States
 We are not seeking regulatory approval to market Korlym outside the United States. If we do so, we (or our potential future partners) will have to complete an approval process similar to the U.S. approval process in foreign target markets before we can distribute our product candidates in those countries. The approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and can involve additional preclinical and clinical trials. Foreign approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. Regulatory approval of pricing is required in most countries other than the United States. The prices approved may be too low to generate an acceptable return.
Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which they will be covered by government health care programs and commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Although this trend has not had a material impact on the amount or timing of our revenues, these third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce physician utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.

Other Healthcare Laws 
 We are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physicians’ sunshine laws and regulations.  
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the criminal statute governing healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. We expect that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 In addition, there has been increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The PPACA, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers must report such payments to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
