ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
FARO was founded in 1982 and re-incorporated in Florida in 1992. Our worldwide headquarters are located at 250 Technology Park, Lake Mary, Florida 32746 and our telephone number is (407) 333-9911. 
We are a global technology company that designs, develops, manufactures, markets and supports software driven, three-dimensional (“3D”) measurement, imaging, and realization solutions for the 3D metrology, architecture, engineering and construction (“AEC”) and public safety analytics markets. We enable our customers to capture, measure, manipulate, interact with and share data from the physical world in a virtual environment and then translate this information back into the physical domain. Our technology enables highly accurate 3D measurement, imaging, comparison and projection of parts and complex structures within production, assembly and quality assurance processes. Our FARO suite of 3D products and software solutions are used for inspection of components and assemblies, rapid prototyping, reverse engineering, documenting large volume or structures in 3D, surveying and construction, assembly layout, machine guidance as well as in investigation and reconstructions of crash and crime scenes. We sell the majority of our solutions through a direct sales force across a range of industries including automotive, aerospace, metal and machine fabrication, surveying, architecture, engineering and construction, public safety forensics and other industries.
COVID-19
Our business is significantly vulnerable to the economic effects of pandemics and other public health crises, including the ongoing novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic that has surfaced in virtually every country of our global operating footprint. During 2020, we experienced a significant decline in the demand for our products and services across all of our served markets as a result of the impact of the spread of COVID-19. While COVID-19 has negatively impacted demand for our products and services overall, it has provided us with the opportunity to adapt to operating in a virtual environment. We significantly increased the utilization of our existing virtual sales demonstration infrastructure which has enabled ongoing customer product education. We launched an updated web-based learning system with Faro Academy that has resulted in an increase in the attendance of our virtual training and product information seminars as our customers take advantage of the opportunity to remotely participate and to better understand the capabilities of our products and software offerings.
We continue to assess the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business results and remain committed to taking actions to address the health and safety of our employees and customers, as well as the negative effects from demand disruption and production impacts, including, but not limited to, the following:
•Operating our business with a focus on our employee health and safety, which includes minimizing travel, implementing remote work policies, maintaining employee distancing and enhancing the sanitation of all of our facilities;
•Monitoring of our liquidity, reduction of supply flows into our manufacturing facilities, disciplined inventory management, and limiting capital expenditures; and
•Continuously reviewing our financial strategy to enhance financial flexibility in these volatile financial markets.
We continue to maintain a strong capital structure with a cash balance of $185.6 million and no debt as of December 31, 2020. We believe that our liquidity position is adequate to meet our projected needs in the reasonably foreseeable future.
Strategy
Historically, we operated in five verticals—3D Manufacturing, Construction Building Information Modeling (“Construction BIM”), Public Safety Forensics, 3D Design and Photonics—and had three reporting segments—3D Manufacturing, Construction BIM and Emerging Verticals. During the second half of 2019, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and FARO's management team formulated and began to implement a new comprehensive strategic plan for our business. Our strategic planning process included extensive conversations with employees, customers, investors and suppliers to identify both where the Company can provide sustained and differentiated customer value and where opportunities existed to improve operating efficiencies. We identified areas of our business that needed enhanced focus or change in order to improve our efficiency and cost structure. As part of our strategic plan, we reassessed and redefined our go-to-market strategy, refocused our marketing engagement with our customers, re-evaluated our hardware and software product portfolio and examined how key decisions are made throughout our global organization. Additionally, we focused on other organizational optimization efforts, including the simplification of our overly complex management structure. 
As part of our new strategic plan, and based on the recommendation of our CEO, who is also our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), in the fourth quarter of 2019, we eliminated our vertical structure in favor of a functional structure. Our new executive leadership team is comprised of functional leaders in areas such as sales, marketing, operations, research and development and general and administrative, and resources are allocated to each function at a consolidated unit level. We no longer have separate business units, segment managers or vertical leaders who report to the CODM with respect to operations, operating results or planning for levels or components below the total Company level. Instead, our CODM now allocates resources and evaluates performance on a Company-wide basis. Based on these changes, commencing with the fourth quarter of 2019, we report as one reporting segment that develops, manufactures, markets, supports and sells a suite of 3D imaging and software solutions. 
In addition to the reorganization of the Company’s structure, we evaluated our hardware and software product portfolio and the operations of certain of our recent acquisitions. As a result of this evaluation, we simplified our hardware and software product portfolio and divested our Photonics business and 3D Design related assets obtained from our acquisition of Opto-Tech SRL and its subsidiary Open Technologies SRL (collectively, “Open Technologies”) in the second quarter of 2020.
On February 14, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a global restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”), which supports our strategic plan in an effort to improve operating performance and ensure that we are appropriately structured and resourced to deliver sustainable value to our shareholders and customers. Key activities under the Restructuring Plan, which targeted $40 million in annualized savings to be realized by the fourth quarter of 2020, include decreasing total headcount by approximately 500 employees upon the completion of the Restructuring Plan. The elimination of our vertical structure allowed us to successfully complete our redefined go-to-market strategy which placed increased focus on our customers and enabled our sales employees, supported by our talented pool of field application engineers, to sell all product lines globally. 
Our new marketing leadership team has focused its efforts on gaining an increased understanding of customer applications and workflows which enables value-based product positioning while optimizing our customer's total cost of ownership. By strengthening our understanding of customer applications and workflows, we will continue to develop high-value solutions across our product and software platforms. Also, our marketing leadership team has transformed our lead generation process and implemented technology to provide our sales organization with higher quality leads which optimizes the time and effort spent by our newly organized sales team. 
We continue to focus on organizational optimization and improved decision making throughout the Company. Prior to the execution of the Restructuring Plan, the Company had strong geographic organizations with decentralized decision making. Additionally, the previous vertical structure layered on top of the geographic organization led to an overly complex and costly management structure. The newly formed global functional organization has enabled centralized management and clear process ownership, eliminating redundant resources and increasing the Company's agility and ability to execute the new strategic plan during the COVID-19 global pandemic. 
We made significant progress executing the Restructuring Plan during 2020. We recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $15.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisting of severance and related benefits, professional fees and other related charges and costs including a non-cash expense of $0.4 million related to the disposal of our Photonics business and 3D Design related assets. The reduction of our global workforce and new cost structure allowed the Company to maintain a strong capital structure despite depressed sales levels primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
At this time, we are continuing to evaluate the future key activities by which these additional charges will originate. We estimate additional pre-tax charges of $5 million to $15 million for fiscal year 2021. These activities are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2021. 
Acquisition
On August 21, 2020, FARO Technologies, Inc. issued a press release announcing that it has acquired Advanced Technical Solutions in Scandinavia AB (“Open Technologies”), a Swedish company focused on 3D digital twin solution technology. ATS software and proprietary traceable 3D system enables highly accurate and repeatable 3D scans. High accuracy 3D digital twin simulations allow capital intensive industries such as automotive and aerospace to reduce their time to market and cost.
Industry Background
We have a wide variety of customers that support a large number of industries, including automotive, aerospace, metal and machine fabrication, surveying, architecture, engineering and construction, as well as, public safety forensics. The pressures in improving overall manufacturing costs, improving profitability in AEC and the need for more complete information in public safety all are driving the need for more accurate 3D data faster, more automated and available remotely, world-wide. In each of the industries we serve, there is a growing need for accurate 3D information for high accuracy inspection, machine alignment and calibration, as-built modeling and design, quality control, digital twin and crash and crime scene investigations as well as pre-incident planning. Each of these industries are undergoing some form of a digital transformation that drives the need for our solutions to help improve our customers’ yields, reduce costs and drive additional profitability.
In the manufacturing industry, the continued focus on higher yields, cost reductions and decreased time to market drive the need for more accurate information to support overall manufacturing processes including part quality, machine down time and overall manufacturing yield. The dimensional metrology market will be challenged to continue to provide higher accuracy results to meet the continuing demand of ever tightening tolerances in both the automotive and aerospace industries. The higher accuracy requirements will also result in trends away from hand measurement tools towards more automated and integrated equipment. With increasing pressure on costs, the need for tighter quality control and increased automation will drive the adoption of applications and processes with the need for real-time 3D information to make quick, accurate decisions to optimize the manufacturing process. Industry 4.0 will also continue to drive the need to have 3D information available on-demand across the entire manufacturing ecosystem. 
The emergence of building information modeling (“BIM”) in the AEC market has required improvements in 3D documentation, coordination and simulation across the entire building lifecycle. BIM, in part, is the compilation of a 3D model representation of a project that can be updated real time and compare actual to design. BIM is believed to become more prevalent as it aides in reducing cost associated with scrap and overruns. The ability to obtain accurate, real-time 3D measurements and information will help to replace existing methodologies such as tape measures and chalk lines. In addition, an increase in modular and pre-fab construction is being driven by growing urbanization, government initiatives and a need for affordable housing. Modular and pre-fab construction allow for building all, or large portions, of a building and then assembling these on-site. The processes of creating such structures resembles more traditional manufacturing flows where real-time 3D measurements and information can vastly improve the costs associated with re-work of materials and poor quality. 
The increased focus in public safety around cost, technology adoption and public scrutiny will increase the acceptance of 3D solutions to accurately capture and analyze crime and crash scenes. Body cams, drones, and advanced analytical software are all examples of increased technology adoption in the public safety sector. Laser scanning technology is used today to capture crime scenes quickly and accurately before leaving the scene. The 3D point cloud that is generated from this data allows for further detailed analysis around bullet trajectory, blood spatter and cast off with full confidence and without the need to revisit the crime scene. This information can be easily shared between police investigators, district attorneys and defense attorneys across multiple jurisdictions. In addition, crash scenes can also be reconstructed by using the 3D information collected while on-site. This information can also be easily shared among different departments, insurance companies and investigators. 3D data capture and analysis allows pre-incident planning activities to prepare in the event of an emergency such as fires or for tactical planning of safety-relevant events like political summits or schools. The time savings and confidence in data collection and analysis will continue to result in 3D technology becoming an integral set of tools in public safety analytics.

We employ a variety of marketing techniques to promote brand awareness and customer identification. As of December 31, 2020, we employed 511 sales and marketing specialists globally. 
Research and Development
We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain what we believe to be our technological leadership, which will require ongoing enhancements of both our hardware and software products and the development of new applications and products that provide 3D measurement and imaging solutions. The field of 3D measurement and imaging continues to expand, and new technologies and applications will be essential to competing in this market. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in the development of new technologies, the commercialization of new products that build on our existing technological base, and the enhancement and development of additional applications for our products.
Our research and development efforts are directed primarily at enhancing the functional adaptability of our current products and developing new and innovative products that respond to specific requirements of the emerging market for 3D measurement and imaging solutions. Research and development activities, especially with respect to new products and technologies, are subject to significant risks, and there can be no assurance that any of our research and development activities will be completed successfully or on schedule, or, if completed, will be commercially accepted.
At December 31, 2020, we employed 258 scientists and technicians in our research and development efforts. Research and development expenses were approximately $42.9 million in 2020, compared to $44.2 million in 2019 and $46.1 million in 2018.
Intellectual Property
We own approximately 702 patents and pending patent applications worldwide, which generally expire on a rolling basis between 2021 and 2045. We also own approximately 90 trademark registrations worldwide, with 46 pending trademark applications.
Our success and ability to maintain a competitive position depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of contractual provisions and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary information. However, there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information will be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or preclude third-party development of similar intellectual property.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We intend to vigorously defend our proprietary rights against infringement by third parties. However, policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, particularly in foreign countries, and we may be unable to determine the extent, if any, to which unauthorized uses of our products exist. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
We do not believe that any of our products infringe on the valid, proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products. Such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
Manufacturing and Assembly
Manufacturing consists primarily of assembling and integrating components and subassemblies purchased from suppliers into finished products. The primary components, which include machined parts and electronic circuit boards, are produced by subcontractors according to our specifications. Products are assembled, calibrated and tested for accuracy and functionality before shipment. We perform limited in-house circuit board assembly and component part machining. Typically, we enter into purchase commitments for manufacturing components to cover production requirements for 60 to 120 days. We have entered, and may continue to enter, into longer agreements to purchase sufficient inventory to satisfy warranty commitments or to ensure adequate component availability. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules.
Our manufacturing, engineering, and design headquarters have been registered to the ISO 9001 standard since July 1998. Semi-annual surveillance audits have documented continuous improvement to this multinational standard. Currently, our manufacturing sites in Lake Mary, Florida; Exton, Pennsylvania; Stuttgart, Germany; Schaffhausen, Switzerland; and Singapore are jointly registered to ISO 9001. Our FARO Laser Tracker, FaroArm®, and FAROBluTM and PrizmTM laser line probe products are all registered to ISO 17025:2005. We continue to examine our scope of registration as our business evolves, and we have chosen English as the standard business language for our operations.
Our efforts to register our manufacturing, engineering and design headquarters to the ISO 9001 standard in concert with the ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System Certification verifies our commitment to quality through an internationally recognized standard. Additionally, we take a global approach to ISO 17025:2005 regarding the recognition of the Competence of Calibration and Testing Laboratories, seeking to have all locations registered with similar scopes of accreditation and capabilities for the products generated and serviced.
We manufacture our FARO Quantum Arm products in our manufacturing facility located in Switzerland for customer orders from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), in our manufacturing facility located in Singapore for customer orders from the Asia-Pacific region, and in our manufacturing facility located in Florida for customer orders from the Americas. We manufacture our FARO Focus laser scanner in our manufacturing facilities located in Germany and Switzerland for customer orders from EMEA and the Asia-Pacific region, and in our manufacturing facility located in Pennsylvania for customer orders from the Americas. We manufacture our FARO Laser Tracker and our FARO Laser Projector products in our facility located in Pennsylvania. We expect all of our existing manufacturing facilities to have the production capacity necessary to support our volume requirements during 2021.
Competition
Our measurement systems compete in the broad and highly competitive market for measurement devices for manufacturing and industrial applications, which, in addition to portable articulated arms, laser trackers, 3D imaging and laser scanner products, consist of fixed-base CMMs, templates and go/no-go gages, check fixtures, handheld measurement tools, and various categories of surveying equipment. In the FaroArm® portfolio, FARO Laser Tracker, and FARO Focus solution lines, we compete primarily with Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence, a division of Hexagon AB; Automated Precision, Inc.; Artec Europe, S.a.r.l.; Leica Geosystems AG, a division of Hexagon AB; and Trimble Inc. In the FARO Laser Projector product line, we compete primarily with Virtek Vision International, a division of Gerber Technology LLC. We also compete in these product lines with a number of other smaller companies. We compete on the basis of technical innovation, product performance, quality and value with respect to all of our products. 
We will be required to make continued investments in technology and product development to maintain and extend the technological advantage that we believe we currently have over our competition. However, we cannot be certain that our technology or our product development efforts will allow us to successfully compete as the industry evolves. As the market for our measurement systems expands, additional competition may emerge, and our existing and future competitors may commit more resources to the markets in which we participate.
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations, including those governing antitrust and competition, the environment, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of covered electronic products and components, import and export of products, currency conversions and repatriation, taxation of foreign earnings, and the use of local employees and suppliers. Our foreign operations are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar foreign anti-corruption laws, which makes illegal any payments to government officials or government employees that are intended to induce their influence to assist us or to gain any improper advantage for us. We operate in certain regions in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia-Pacific that are more prone to risk under these anti-corruption laws.
Manufacturers of electrical goods are subject to the European Union’s RoHS2 and WEEE directives, which took effect during 2006. RoHS2 prohibits the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products, and WEEE makes producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of covered electronic products and components. We currently hold RoHS2 and WEEE registration, and we believe we are in compliance with such directives of the European Union. 
In addition, a number of data protection laws impact, or may impact, the manner in which we collect, process and transfer personal data. Most notably, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which went into effect in May 2018, expands data protection compliance obligations and authorizes significantly increased fines for noncompliance, requiring additional compliance resources and efforts on our part. Further, a number of other regions where we do business, including the United States, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America, have enacted or are considering new data protection regulations that may impact our business activities that involve the processing of personal data. In addition, U.S. and international laws that have been applied to protect user privacy (including laws regarding unfair and deceptive practices in the U.S. and GDPR in the EU) may be subject to evolving interpretations or applications in light of privacy developments. For example, evolution of laws governing the cross-border transfer of data, such as the invalidation of the EU–U.S. Privacy Shield, creates additional uncertainty around the legality and logistics of such transfers. Compliance with enhanced data protection laws requires additional resources and efforts, and noncompliance with personal data protection regulations could result in increased regulatory enforcement and significant monetary fines and costs.
We currently sell our products and related services to the U.S. Government (the “Government”) under two General Services Administration (“GSA”) Federal Supply Schedule contracts (the “GSA Contracts”). The Government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts with us either at their discretion or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract, which could expose us to liability and impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders. Our sales to the Government under the GSA Contracts represented approximately 2.8% of our total sales for 2020.
Backlog and Seasonality
At December 31, 2020, we had orders representing approximately $19.7 million in sales outstanding, of which $7.9 million related to services that we expect to deliver within one year. The product-related outstanding orders as of December 31, 2020 were $11.8 million, of which $4.2 million were shipped by February 15, 2021. As of February 15, 2021, we had orders representing approximately $16.4 million in sales outstanding, inclusive of 2020 open and undelivered orders, of which $8.1 million related to service orders and $8.3 million were product-related orders. We believe that a significant portion of the outstanding product-related orders as of February 15, 2021 will be shipped during 2021. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had orders representing approximately $28.0 million and $17.5 million in sales outstanding, respectively.
We typically experience greater order volume during the fourth quarter, as customers spend the remaining balances of their capital expenditure budgets.
Human Capital
At December 31, 2020, we had 1,364 full-time employees worldwide, consisting of 511 sales and marketing professionals, 265 customer service/training/application engineering specialists, 192 production and supply chain staff, 258 research and development staff, and 138 administrative staff. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and believe our employee relations are satisfactory. 
The Company believes that our future growth and success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled personnel. The executive management team is responsible for developing and executing the Company's human capital strategy. The human capital strategy includes the attraction, acquisition, engagement and development of the Company's employees necessary to execute on our strategy and design of employee compensation and benefits programs to fit the needs of our worldwide employees. The CEO and Chief People Officer regularly update the Company's board of directors on key areas of our human capital strategy, including the following:
Diversity and Inclusion:  FARO believes in the benefits workforce diversity can provide. Innovation is critical for any technology company – and we believe that it benefits by the creative thinking that happens when people with different perspectives and backgrounds come together. We believe diverse teams can better relate to the many and varied needs of our customers. We promote a culture where individual differences are valued which also allows us to attract the very best talent further encouraging our people to reach their full potential. As part of this cultural commitment, we also invest in formal programs designed to foster diversity through networking, talent management and targeted career development.
We conduct regular workforce engagement surveys to take the “pulse” of our people and gather their insights. We are committed to making all benefit and employment-related decisions in compliance with established equal employment opportunity statutes and without regard to religion, national origin, age, gender, race, color, ancestry, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, citizenship, pregnancy, medical condition or any other protected class status, as defined by local, state or federal laws.
We believe strongly in building a global workforce that is diverse and that can build strong working relationships with our customers in the countries we operate. We support an inclusive culture and motivate our workforce to be themselves while at work. We are committed to providing our employees with a positive and safe work environment that is free of discrimination, harassment and workplace violence. We encourage our employees to embrace different ideas, strengths, interests and cultural backgrounds. People development, and inclusion are important to us. We understand the importance of giving back to the communities in which we live and work.
Health and Safety: Health, safety, and the well-being of our employees is one of our top priorities. We strive to achieve world-class safety levels on an annual basis. Our safety culture focuses on reducing workplace injuries and is supported by effective communication and reporting of workplace injuries. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of our non-manufacturing and technical service personnel continue to work remote from our offices. Our global manufacturing operations, including facilities located in Exton, Pennsylvania, Lake Mary, Florida, Germany, Switzerland and Singapore continue to be designated as essential business and therefore continue to operate. To protect our employees in facilities in which our teams operate, we have employed significant preventative measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees, including temperature screenings prior to entering our plants, enforcement of safe distancing between employees within our plants, encouragement that employees wash hands often, and stay-at-home measures if symptoms of COVID-19 arise during work hours or prior to entering our plants.
