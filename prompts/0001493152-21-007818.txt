ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
SurgePays, Inc. (“SurgePays,” “we”, “our” or “the Company”), incorporated in Nevada on August 18, 2006, is a technology-driven company building a next generation supply chain software platform that can offer wholesale goods and services more cost efficiently than traditional and existing wholesale distribution models.
 
Our current focus is offering wholesale goods and services direct to convenience stores, bodegas, minimarts, tiendas and other corner stores providing goods and services primarily to the underbanked community. We leverage Direct Store Delivery and the cost saving efficiencies of direct e-commerce to provide as many commonly sold consumable products as possible while increasing profit margins for these stores. These products include herbal stimulants, energy shots, dry foods, communication accessories, novelties, PPP products, bagged snacks, processed meats, automotive parts and many more goods, all in one convenient wholesale e-commerce platform.
 
Surge Marketplace Software
 
SurgePays Blockchain Software is a multi-purpose e-commerce platform offering wholesale goods and services direct to convenience stores, bodegas, minimarts, tiendas and other corner stores providing goods and services primarily to the underbanked community. The merchant or clerk is able to use the portal interface – similar to a website – with image driven navigation to add wireless minutes to any prepaid wireless carrier’s phone and access to other services such as bill payment and loading debit cards. We believe what makes us unique is that it also offers the merchant the ability to order wholesale consumable goods at a significant discount from traditional distributors through the portal with one touch ease. We are essentially a wholesale e-commerce storefront that offers products direct from manufactures while cutting out the middleman. The goal of the SurgePays Portal is to leverage the competitive advantage and efficiencies of direct e-commerce to provide as many commonly sold consumable products as possible to convenience stores, corner markets, bodegas, and supermarkets while increasing profit margins for these stores. These products include herbal stimulants, energy pills and shot drinks, dry foods, communication accessories, novelties, PPP products, bagged snacks, processed meats, automotive parts and many more goods, all in one convenient wholesale e-commerce platform.
ECS
 
Electronic Check Services (“ECS”) has been a financial technology tech and wireless top-up platform for over 15 years. On October 1, 2019, we acquired ECS primarily for the favorable ACH banking relationship. ECS is a fintech transactions platform processing over 20,000 transactions a day at approximately 8,000 independently owned retail stores. The goal was to incorporate our blockchain components into the existing EGS network. After a year of development and integration, we believe the ECS platform has been successfully merged into our platform with secure ledger data backups and will continue to serve as the proven backbone for wireless top-up transactions and wireless product aggregation.
 
LocoRabbit Wireless
 
LocoRabbit Wireless offers prepaid wireless plans with talk, text, and 4G LTE data at prices that average 30% – 50% lower than competitors. Available nationwide, LocoRabbit Wireless is sold online direct to consumers and by a nationwide network of convenience stores, gas stations, mini-marts, bodegas and tiendas connected to our software platform. Due to controlling the wireless company and the payment platform. We are able to exclusively offer an industry high commission to the retailer for top-ups paid monthly at the client’s store.

True Wireless
 
True Wireless is licensed through the United States Federal Communications Commission to provide Lifeline Service (subsidized wireless service to qualifying low-income customers) in 5 states. Utilizing the T-Mobile wireless backbone, True Wireless provides discounted and free wireless service to veterans and other disadvantaged customers who qualify for certain federal programs such as SNAP (EBT) and Medicaid.
Surge Logics
 
Surge Logics, Inc. (“Logics”) is a performance-driven marketing firm focused on the mass tort industry for attorneys and law firms. We primarily perform client acquisition and retention services for attorneys and law firms by operating highly-scalable digital marketing campaigns, called performance campaigns, using our proprietary technology and data-driven analytics. These performance campaigns, and the related follow-up by our experienced in-house team, enable our attorney and law firm advertising clients to more effectively and economically connect with potential clients they are seeking to represent in existing or planned litigation. Our proven strategy of delivering cost-effective lead acquisitions and retained cases to our attorney and law firm clients means those clients are better able to manage their media and advertising budgets and reach targeted audiences more quickly and effectively.
 
Our customized performance campaign offers are targeted at clients interested in completing signed retainers. The first step is to understand the specific criteria of our client. After this, we proceed to generate consumer traffic to our digital media platforms or our clients’ media platforms. Although there is no assurance of generating revenue from this move, we go all the way, bearing all the costs and risks involved. When we use our resources in acquiring consumer traffic, we want to help our clients amass cost-effective retained cases effectively. This, in turn, guarantees maximum profit margins for them.


Centercom
 
On January 17, 2019, we announced the completion of an agreement to acquire a 40% equity ownership of Centercom Global, S.A. de C.V. (“Centercom”). Centercom is a dynamic operations center currently providing the Company with sales support, customer service, IT infrastructure design, graphic media, database programming, software development, revenue assurance, lead generation, and other various operational support services. Anthony N. Nuzzo, a director and officer and a 10% shareholder of our voting equity has a 50% interest in Centercom. Centercom also provides call center support for various third-party clients. Centercom is based in El Salvador.
 
The strategic acquisition of a bilingual operations hub has powered the Company’s rapid growth and revenue. Centercom has been built to support the infrastructure required to rapidly scale in synergy and efficiency to support the Company’s sales growth, customer service and development.

Experienced Leadership Team
 
Our management team consists of 4 executives with over 20 years in the prepaid wireless, underbanked and convenience store distribution industry while presiding over companies with a collective revenue run of over $2 Billion. Our finance team is led by a CFO with a background in private equity backed, and publicly traded companies ranging from $100 million to over $1.3 billion in annual revenue while our software development team is led by a CTO who got his start in the early days of operating systems. The combination of operating skills from our management team with the experience of successfully leading major multi-million-dollar, multinational companies give our organization a significant strength relative to most small- and medium-sized beverage companies.
Growth Strategies
 
Our primary long-term goal is to become a top provider of goods and services to independently owned retail stores across the country. We intend to achieve this goal by driving organic growth and acquisitions behind our existing portfolio of life enhancing underbanked products, in all major markets and regions, through an aligned network of retailer and ISO partners.
 
Our key growth strategies include the following:
 

● | developing a powerful, performance-oriented, and metric-driven organizational culture; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | developing sales/trade tool kits to empower our sales force network and ISOs to engage with customers nationwide; 
● | developing brand/marketing tool kits for current and new brands and segments; 
● | expanding distribution of same store sales with current clients, while adding new clients; 
● | strengthening our supply chain to achieve best in class costs, on-time/as promised logistics and superior customer service; 
● | improving gross product margins with rearchitected cost of goods sold, improved efficiency, and improved net revenue with new products; 
● | continuous development and improvements to our software platforms improving efficiencies and overall clients experience 
● | upgrading infrastructure, systems and processes with enterprise resource planning systems, improved financial reporting, operating expense control, and strengthened key metrics and accounting and control procedures; and 
● | strengthening our financial foundation via accessing the capital markets, solidifying long-term banking partners and facilities, and pursuing transformative organic and acquisitory growth. 

 
SurgePays’ strategy for increasing revenues is based on developing, maintaining, and expanding our nationwide network of retail stores. Our relationship-driven approach to selling along with providing many of the top selling products at a wholesale discount greater than traditional distributors gives management confidence of continued growth into the foreseeable future.

Sales and Marketing
 
Sales Growth will be through both acquisition and organic means:
 
Acquisitions
 
A key part of our business strategy includes acquiring companies to support our growth and enhance our product portfolio. Our acquisition strategy has two channels.
 

● | We will acquire existing distributors of products with a sales network of stores. Upon acquisition, we will maximize the relationship with this store base by upselling our additional product offerings while utilizing the efficiencies and economies of scale from our core business to increase profit. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We will acquire manufacturers of products that are either currently sold to our target based of stores, or regionally established companies that we can take nationwide, increasing exposure and thus increasing profits margins. This channel will also increase our competitive advantage by exclusively offering certain products and or offering these products at a discount compared to traditional distributors. 

Organic – Sales team
 
Our business strategy of organically expanding our network of retail locations, or points of distribution, also includes the following two channels:
 

● | We currently have an in-house sales and merchandising team, whose compensation is highly variable and highly performance-based. Each salesperson has individual targets for increasing “base” volume through distribution expansion, and “incremental” volume through promotions and other in-store merchandising and display activity. As distribution to new major customers, new major channels, or new major markets increases, we will expand the sales and marketing team on a variable basis. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We will utilize the Independent Sales Organizations model similar to credit card processing vendors. These independent contractors represent various non-competing products and or already cover a sales route. While traveling or through a network of existing relationships, they sign up new stores to the SurgePays platform and are compensated a commission for ongoing sales. 

Disrupting the Supply Chain
 
The traditional distribution components of transportation, warehousing, profit, and labor normally accounts for 25% of the retail cost of a product sold in convenience stores. The value proposition is realized by us through eliminating the markup the old-school supply chain adds to the wholesale price of goods. With Direct Store Delivery (DSD), goods can be taken to the retailer directly from the manufacturer and this will invariably reduce the cost price of the product to the store owner. Store owners can make their orders using one-click ordering on our software interface to get commonly sold wholesale products shipped directly to them. We have established models and programs to market and sell these products or services of our stores. We have the capability and capacity to scale significantly quick to bring approved products into stores nationwide.
Competition
 
Many of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and name recognition than we have. Most traditional convenience store distributors are companies that have been in business for over 50 years and utilize the historical “manufacturing plant to truck to warehouse to truck to store” logistics model. However, we believe that with our diverse product line, better efficiencies resulting in lower wholesale cost of goods sold, we have the ability to obtain a large market share and continue to generate sales growth and compete in the industry. The principal competitive factors in all our product markets are technical features, quality, availability, price, customer support, and distribution coverage. The relative importance of each of these factors varies depending on the region. We believe using our direct store distribution model nationwide will open significant opportunities for growth.

The markets in which we operate can be generally categorized as highly competitive. In order to maximize our competitive advantages, we continue to expand our product portfolio to capitalize on market trends, changes in technology and new product releases. Based on available data for our served markets, we estimate that our market share of the convenience store sales business at this time is less than 1%. A substantial acquisition would be necessary to meaningfully and rapidly change our market share percentage.
 
Distributors generally do not have a broad set of product and service offerings or capabilities, and no single distributor currently provides all the top selling consumables while offering products and services to enhance the lifestyle of the underbanked such as prepaid wireless, gift cards, bill payment and reloadable debit cards. We believe this creates a significant opportunity for a dynamic paradigm shift to a nationwide wholesale e-commerce platform.
 
Nationwide Product Deployment
 
The SurgePays Blockchain platform streamlines the process for bringing products directly to the retail store. Our sales protocols have been tested and proven transferable from one product offering to another while ultimately providing our network of stores with better pricing and a larger product selection.
Competitive Edge
 
Our competitive edge is simple; we have the ability through our software platform, along with our relationships, capacity, efficiency, economies of scale and experience necessary to bring our products or services to market in an effective and efficient manner to ensure success. Our blockchain platform streamlines the process for bringing products directly to the targeted retail store. Our sales protocols have been tested and proven transferable from one product offering to another while ultimately improving our target stores with better pricing and more product selection.
 
Our strategy for increasing revenues is based on developing, maintaining, and expanding our nationwide network of retail stores. Our relationship-driven approach to selling along with providing many of the top selling c-store products at a wholesale discount greater than traditional distributors gives management confidence of continued growth into the foreseeable future.
 
Research and Development Activities
 
We conduct research and development on an ongoing basis, including new and existing products to offer and software product development to ensure we are delivering the most efficient, secure, and fast transactions at the store level. The SurgePays software platform is housed on the Amazon Web Service Cloud for redundancy, stability, and reliability. Traditionally, convenience stores are high volume and fast paces stores where space at the register is at a premium, thus leaving no room for a computer so wireless top-ups or cell phone activations are done over a Verifone terminal traditionally used for processing credit cards. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue the enhancement of our software platform and application to transact via tablets and other smaller devices while developing new products that meet or anticipate such changes in our served markets. Many of the stores we serve are now connected to the internet. This has allowed us to innovate our software to be more adaptive to equipment that is more compatible with the space constraints of the register area in a store.
 
Much of the development for specific products we offer is done by the manufacturers and is dictated by market conditions. For example: When the iPhone 12 was released, we simply added iPhone 12 chargers and adapters to its suite of smartphone accessories. Our continuity is secure due to our ability to adapt through adding new products seamlessly.
 
Seasonality
 
We experience some seasonality whereby the peak tax season months show a higher level of sales and consumption. However, the structure of our business and range of products in our portfolio mitigate any major fluctuations. Our revenue during the peak tax season months in the spring have historically been approximately 5% greater than the peak other months, and as our product portfolio continues to expand, the level of seasonal peaks we expect to diminish.

Employees
 
As of March 31, 2021 we had 30 full-time employees and 1 part-time employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that relationship with our employees to be good.
 
We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
