GENERAL



The following is a summary of some of the information contained in this document. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this document to “our Company,” “us,” “we,” “our,” “Stratus,” or the “Company” are to Stratus Capital Corp.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 



Stratus Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation, (“Stratus Capital,” “the Company,” “We," "Us," or “Our”) is a publicly quoted real estate development company seeking to develop or redevelop residential, commercial or mixed-use properties.
Stratus Capital Corp., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in Delaware on April 13, 2018, which was a result of a Delaware holding company reorganization from a predecessor corporation, Ashcroft Homes Corporation, formerly a Colorado corporation which was merged into a subsidiary and thereupon divested.

Our principal executive offices are located at 8480 East Orchard Road, Suite 1100, Greenwood Village, Colorado 80111 and the telephone number is (720) 214-5000. We maintain a website at www.StratusCap.com, which website is not incorporated herein or a part of this filing.



On June 1, 2021, Stratus Capital on behalf of itself, its respective heirs, executors, administrators, agents, and assignees, Stratus Summit Trail, LLC, (referred to as “Summit”), the Richard and Reagan Dean Family Partnership, LLLP (referred to as “RRDFPLLLP”) and Denver Digital Hub, LLC (referred to as “DDH”) (collectively referred to herein as the “Party” or “Parties.”) entered into a Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”).



RRDFPLLLP and DDH respectively own seventy-five percent (75%) and twenty-five percent (25%) of the membership interest of Summit (“Interest”) and both of these parties sold their entire Interest or a total of one hundred percent (100%) of the Interest of Summit to Stratus Capital.



Stratus Capital has agreed to acquire the Interest owned by RRDFPLLLP and DDH of Summit of which Summit owns a total of 21 building lots as identified as Exhibit A to the Purchase Agreement within Grand County, town of Fraser, Colorado (“Subject Property”). Stratus Capital agreed that the continuing engineering, architectural or entitlement improvements are to be assigned to Summit if Stratus Capital does not fully pay the Promissory Note (‘the Note’) issued in respect of this transaction as per its terms and provisions as described below.



The purchase price is equal to $60,000 per lot, or 21 lots equal to $1,260,000 adjusted for any site or infrastructure costs as agreed upon by the Parties.



Stratus Capital was to fully pay the Note on or before October 31, 2021, or as agreed by the Parties. This repayment date was subsequently extended to March 30, 2022 and now further to July 30, 2022. As denoted within the Deed of Trust of the Note, RRDFPLLLP and DDH will retain a security interest within the Subject Property until the Note is fully paid per its terms and provisions.



The Closing date shall be 30 days from the date of the Purchase Agreement (unless extended by mutual agreement), title will be provided free and clear with exception of debt assumption and the Note and a special warranty deed is agreed upon by the Parties. Closing of the transaction is formally pending audit of Summit, but Stratus Capital is actively managing the project under a management agreement. The Closing date was subsequently extended to September 30, 2021, then to March 30, 2022, and then now further to July 30, 2022, by mutual consent.



Simultaneously with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, Stratus Capital executed and issued a Promissory Note (“Note”) with personal guarantee of Peter Gonzalez, our CEO, (“Gonzalez”) to RRDFPLLLP and DDH as consideration for the Purchase Agreement. The Note is for the principal sum of One Million Two Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars and No/100ths Dollars ($1,260,000.00), together with interest on the unpaid principal balance from the date hereof, until paid, at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum. The Note becomes effective upon the Closing date of the Purchase Agreement.



The Parties also agree that as consideration for services provided within the normal course of business since 2019 or initial acquisition of the Subject Property by Summit, a development fee is due and payable to Willamette Group Trust (“WGT”) equal to $12,500 per lot or $262,500 which is excluded from proceeds due to Seller pursuant to 1(d) of the Purchase Agreement. WGT is a related party, controlled by Stratus Capital principal Gonzalez and WGT agrees that all fees due to itself shall be waived if Stratus Capital does not perform on the terms and provisions of the Note. The agreement with WGT becomes effective upon the Closing date of the Purchase Agreement.

IMPACT OF COVID-19



We have only limited operations at this time and consequently have not been directly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak at this time. However, the detrimental effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on the economy as a whole may have a detrimental impact on our ability to raise funding and commence operations for the foreseeable future.
Reports to Security Holders



We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and as such, we intend to file all required disclosures.



You may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC in the SEC’s Public Reference Section, Room 1580, 100 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Section by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Additionally, the SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, which can be found at http://www.sec.gov.
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act



We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 101 of the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) as we did not have more than $1.07 billion in annual gross revenues and did not have such amount as of December 31, 2021, our last fiscal year.



We may lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year during which (i) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion or (ii) we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company if at any time we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement.



As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable to generally reporting companies. These provisions include:




- | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statement and only two years of related Management Discussion and Analysis Disclosures:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such sections are provided below:



Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires a public company’s auditor to attest to, and report on, management’s assessment of its internal controls.



Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities and Exchange Act, implemented by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act, require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation.



We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Form 10-K, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).



As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to irrevocably opt in to the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. 



CURRENT BUSINESS



We intend to be engaged in the real estate and land development business in the United States. We intend to develop a portfolio of development opportunities in various stages along with opportunistic acquisitions and partnerships in our core-markets. We operate solely under Stratus Capital Corp. We have historical presence and management experience in the mid-west and south-east regions. We plan to organize our business into the following operating segments:

Early Stage Land Development
In-fill Development of Single-Family Attached
and Multi-Family Product
Opportunistic Joint-Ventures, Partnerships,
and Lending

Organizational Structure

Organizational Structure 
LAND DEVELOPMENT | COMMERCIAL, RESIDENTIAL & MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT | JOINT-VENTURES, PARTNERSHIPS AND LENDING
ENTITLEMENT | SINGLE & MULTI FAMILY PRODUCT | INFILL JOINT-VENTURES 
ASSET REPOSITIONING | SENIOR HOUSING | STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS 
DEVELOPMENT | CONSTRUCTION SERVICES | STRATEGIC LENDING 

Current Projects



NOTE:  We reserve the right to add or delete real estate projects or substitute projects in the event that the economics, timing or financing of one or more of the projects, proves to be infeasible under the circumstances. Management will have sole discretion in making those judgments.



Our procedure for contracting for projects:



The identified projects are sought and generated by Peter Gonzalez, our CEO, through his experience and network within in each market. He generally takes an option or purchase contract personally or through an entity he controls, for a period of time during which he performs due diligence on the market, zoning, potential costs, the market absorption projections, local subcontractors and any environmentally issues. If the Company is able to achieve funding sufficient to buy and build any project or projects, Mr. Gonzalez will assign the option or contract positions to the Company, in full, and at no additional consideration or markup so there is no additional cost to the Company. The Company, as it exists with its current funding, is unable to participate in any project until funding under an Offering has been achieved. At this time, there are no pending contracts or agreements due to the uncertainty of funding.





7
-



Accordingly, there are no contracts for real estate or development under which the Company is obligated in any way to participate or incur any costs, at this time. Mr. Gonzalez has committed, under our conflicts policy, to first offer all projects that meet the consideration criteria, to the Company on the terms that can be negotiated with the sellers and with no markups, and no additional consideration to Mr. Gonzalez.



Project Criteria:



The Company cannot predict or project any profits on any project as it has no history of development. Our project consideration criteria involve three primary elements:



1. Market projections during construction and product marketing period for the project locale.



2. Targeted yield of 24+% on cash cost-there is no assurance that this can be attained-it is a project qualification criteria.



3. Timely availability of financing for the project costs-equity, bank funding, or a combination, in many instances.



Of course, there are many other subordinate considerations such as zoning, utilities, product selection and design, environmental, marketing strategies, that are somewhat variable to individual projects, and cannot be uniformly predicted, or estimated.



We are seeking funding through a Regulation A offering currently filed with the SEC on Form 1-A through CIM Securities. The offering is not yet qualified under Regulation A.



Summary of current development projects under consideration:



Skiff Point Condos, Wood Dove Avenue Townhomes, Washington Park Townhomes, Magnolia Park Condos, Grande Oaks Preserve Condos, Reunion Station Townhomes and Condos, Miller Street Station Townhomes and Perry Park Townhomes. All projects are located in the Southwest, FL, and Denver, CO markets which are experiencing continuing expansion in employment, residential and commercial development, population growth and resulting housing demand.



Business Strategy



Our long-term strategy:



• Pursuing opportunities within our core markets;



• Developing high-quality relationships with our asset partners;



• Maintaining a cost-efficient culture; and



• Appropriately balancing risk and opportunity.



We are committed to improving the communities we work within and enhancing the lifestyle of our neighborhoods. Delivering on this involves thoughtful planning to accommodate the needs of our various customers, homeowners and the surrounding community. We engage unaffiliated civil and architectural firms to develop and augment existing plans in order to ensure that our developments reflect current market updates to complement our surrounding communities.



We intend to acquire our assets in core locations where we can target maximizing long-term shareholder value and operate our business to capitalize on market appreciation and mitigate risks from economic downturns as we recognize the cyclical nature of the national real estate market. We intend to regularly assess our capital allocation strategy to drive shareholder return. We also take advantage of joint venture opportunities, partnerships and lending opportunities as they arise in order to secure asset allocations to share risk and maximize returns.





8
-



We intend to execute this strategy by:



• Increasing our existing land supply through expanding market presence;



• Combining land acquisition and development expertise with development operations;



• Maintaining an efficient capital structure;



• Selectively investing in joint-ventures, partnerships and lending opportunities; and



• Employing and retaining a highly experienced management team with a strong operating track record.



Land and Development Strategies



Community development includes the acquisition and development of communities, which may include obtaining significant planning and entitlement approvals and completing construction of off-site and on-site utilities and infrastructure. We intend to generally operate as small community developers, but in some communities, we operate solely as merchant builders, in which case, we acquire fully planned and entitled lots and may construct on-site improvements or in-fill opportunities.



In order to maximize our expected risk-adjusted return, the allocation of capital for land investment is performed in the discretion of our management (2 persons) at the corporate level with a disciplined approach to overall portfolio management. Macro and micro indices, including but not limited to employment, housing starts, new home sales, re-sales and foreclosures, along with market related shifts in competition, land availability and consumer preferences, are carefully analyzed to determine our land and homebuilding strategy. Our long-term plan is compared on an ongoing basis to current conditions in the marketplace as they evolve and is adjusted to the extent necessary.



Community Integration



We intend to complement each community or neighborhood and governing municipality we interact with, beginning with an overall community master plan and then determining the specific asset opportunity to maximize returns for our shareholders and the stakeholders of the area. After necessary governmental and other approvals have been obtained, we intend to improve the assets as planned.



The life cycle of an asset generally ranges from two to five years, commencing with the acquisition or investment in the asset and continuing through the development phase, concluding with the sale, construction or delivery of product types. The actual life cycle will vary based on the asset type, the development cycle and the general market conditions.



Sources and Availability of Raw Materials



When we commence our business plan of development, based on local market practices, we either directly, or indirectly through our subcontractors, intend to purchase drywall, cement, steel, lumber, insulation and the other building materials necessary to construct the various residential product asset classes we develop. While these materials are generally widely available from a variety of sources, from time to time we may experience material shortages on a localized basis which can substantially increase the price for such materials and our construction process can be slowed. We have multiple sources for the materials we intend to purchase, which will decrease the likelihood that we would experience significant delays due to unavailability of necessary materials.
Trades and Labor



Our construction, land and purchasing teams will coordinate subcontracting services and supervise all aspects of construction work and quality control. We intend to act as a general contractor for residential projects.



Subcontractors perform construction and land development scopes of work, generally under fixed-price contracts. The availability of labor, specifically as it relates to qualified tradespeople, at reasonable prices can be challenging

-



in some markets as the supply chain responds to uneven industry growth and other economic factors that affect the number of people in the workforce.



Procurement and Construction



We plan to have a comprehensive procurement program that leverages our size and regional presence to achieve efficiencies and cost savings. Our procurement objective is to maximize cost and process efficiencies to ensure consistent utilization of established contractual arrangements.
Sales and Marketing



Our marketing program will be built out utilizing a balanced approach of corporate support and local expertise to attract potential lot buyers or homebuyers in a focused, efficient and cost-effective manner. Our sales and marketing teams will provide a generalized marketing framework across our regional operations. We hope to maintain product and price level differentiation through market and customer research to meet the need of our homebuilders and homebuyers.



The central element of our marketing platform is our web presence at www.StratusCap.com. The main purpose of this website is to connect with potential customers.



Competition



The land development and homebuilding business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with numerous national and local competitors of varying sizes, most of which have greater sales and financial resources than us. We compete primarily on the basis of location, lot availability, product design, quality, service, price and reputation.



In order to maximize our sales volumes, profitability and product strategy, we strive to understand our competition and their pricing, product and sales volume strategies and results. Competition among residential land developers and homebuilders of all sizes is based on a number of interrelated factors, including location, lot sizes, reputation, amenities, floor plans, design, quality and price.



Seasonality



We expect to experience variability in our results on a quarterly basis therefore our results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, and we must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet short-term operating requirements. Factors expected to contribute to these fluctuations include, but are not limited to:



• the timing of the introduction and start of construction of new projects;



• the timing of sales;



• the timing of closings of homes, lots and parcels;



• the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for development and construction;



• the condition of the real estate market and general economic conditions in the areas in which we operate;



• Joint-venture, partnerships and loan and investment opportunities;



• construction timetables;



• the cost and availability of materials and labor; and



• weather conditions in the markets in which we develop and build.

Regulation, Environmental, Health and Safety Matters



Regulatory



We are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction and similar matters, including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular property or locality. In a number of our markets, there has been an increase in state and local legislation requiring the dedication of land as open space. In addition, we are subject to various licensing, registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction, advertisement and sale of homes in our communities. The impact of these laws has been to increase our overall costs and may delay the opening of communities or cause us to conclude that development of particular communities would not be economically feasible, even if any or all necessary governmental approvals are obtained. We also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums in one or more of the areas in which we operate, including development of building lots for clients. Generally, such moratoriums relate to insufficient water, power, drainage or sewage facilities or inadequate road capacity.



In order to secure certain approvals in some areas, we may be required to provide affordable housing at below market sales prices of residential product or price certain percentage of building lots to meet these requirements. In addition, local and state governments have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects under their jurisdictions, as well as requiring concessions or that the developer or builder construct certain improvements to public places such as parks and streets or fund schools. The impact of these requirements on us depends on how the various state and local governments in the areas in which we engage, or intend to engage, in development implement their programs. To date, these restrictions have not had a material impact on us.



We are subject to various state and federal statutes, rules and regulations, including those that relate to licensing, lending operations and other areas of mortgage origination and financing. The impact of those statutes, rules and regulations can increase our homebuyers’ cost of financing, increase our cost of doing business, as well as restrict our homebuyers’ access to some types of loans. Certain requirements provided for by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act") have not yet been finalized or fully implemented. The effect of such provisions on our financial services business will depend on the rules that are ultimately enacted. The title and settlement services provided by Inspired Title are subject to various regulations, including regulation by state banking and insurance regulators.



In order for our homebuyers to finance their home purchases with FHA-insured, Veterans Administration-guaranteed or U.S. Department of Agriculture-guaranteed mortgages, we are required to build such homes in accordance with the regulatory requirements of those agencies.



Some states have statutory disclosure requirements or other pre-approval requirements or limitations governing the marketing and sale of new homes. These requirements vary widely from state to state.



Some states require us to be registered as a licensed contractor, a licensed real estate broker and in some markets our sales agents are additionally required to be registered as licensed real estate agents.



Environmental



We also are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of public health and the environment (collectively, “environmental laws”). For example, environmental laws may affect: how we manage storm water runoff, wastewater discharges, and dust; how we develop or operate on properties on or affecting resources such as wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, or areas subject to preservation laws; and how we address contamination. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site. Complying with these environmental laws may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and/or may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Noncompliance with environmental laws could result in fines and penalties, obligations to

11
--



remediate, permit revocation, and other sanctions; and contamination or other environmental conditions at or in the vicinity of our developments could result in claims against us for personal injury, property damage, or other losses.



As part of the land acquisition due diligence process, we intend to utilize environmental assessments to identify environmental conditions that may exist on potential acquisition properties.



We intend to manage compliance with environmental laws at the division level with assistance from the local consultants.



Health and Safety



We are committed to maintaining high standards in health and safety at all of our sites. Key areas of focus are on site conditions meeting exacting health and safety standards, and on subcontractor performance throughout our operating areas meeting or exceeding expectations.
Intellectual Property



We own certain logos and trademarks that are important to our overall branding and sales strategy. Our consumer logos are designed to draw on our recognized homebuilding heritage while emphasizing a customer-centric focus.
Employees, Subcontractors and Consultants



As of March 31, 2022, we have 1 officer, a non-executive director and 4 staff retained as consultants on a part-time basis. Of these, all are engaged in land development, administration and construction operations, senior management facilitate joint-ventures, partnerships or loan investments. As of this date we were not subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.



We will act as a general contractor at times, or as project manager engaging local general contractors with all construction operations. We will use independent consultants and contractors for land planning, civil engineering, architectural, advertising and legal services.



Revenue



We did not record any revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, or from January 1, 2022 through the date of this filing. 



Investment Company Act 1940



Although we will be subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the 1934 Act, we believe we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) insofar as we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. In the event we engage in business combinations that result in us holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the 1940 Act. In such event, we would be required to register as an investment company and incur significant registration and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination from the SEC as to our status under the 1940 Act and, consequently, any violation of the 1940 Act would subject us to material adverse consequences. We believe that, currently, we are exempt under Regulation 3a-2 of the 1940 Act.
Factors Effecting Future Performance



The factors affecting our future performance are listed and explained below under the section “Risk Factors” below. 



Reports to Securities Holders



We provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our shareholders. We will make our financial information equally available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules for a small business issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We are subject to disclosure filing

12
--



requirements including filing Form 10-K annually and Form 10-Q quarterly. In addition, we will file Form 8-K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required. We do not intend to voluntarily file the above reports in the event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (“SEC”), at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
