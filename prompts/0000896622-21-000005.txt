ITEM 1. BUSINESS
WHO ARE WE AND WHAT DO WE DO
Aptar is a global leader in the design and manufacturing of a broad range of innovative drug delivery and consumer product dispensing, sealing and active packaging solutions and services for the prescription drug, consumer health care, injectables, active packaging, beauty, personal care, home care, food and beverage markets. Aptar uses insights, design, engineering and science to create dosing, dispensing, and protective packaging technologies for many of the world's leading brands, in turn, making a meaningful difference in the lives, looks, health and homes of people around the world. Aptar is headquartered in Crystal Lake, Illinois and has approximately 13,000 dedicated employees in 20 different countries. For more information, visit www.aptar.com.
Our business was started in the late 1940’s, manufacturing and selling aerosol valves in the United States, and has grown primarily through acquisitions and internal expansion. In this report, we may refer to AptarGroup, Inc. and its subsidiaries as “AptarGroup”, “Aptar” or the “Company”.
We have manufacturing facilities located throughout the world including North America, Europe, Asia and South America. We have approximately 6,000 customers with no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounting for greater than 5% of our 2020 Net Sales.
Consumers’ preference for convenience and product differentiation through drug delivery and packaging design and function are important to our customers and they have converted many of their packages from non-dispensing formats to dispensing systems that offer enhanced shelf appeal, convenience, cleanliness and accuracy of dosage.
We partner with our customers by providing innovative delivery systems and a suite of comprehensive services to help them succeed. While we offer a wide variety of services and products, our primary products are dispensing pumps, closures, aerosol valves, elastomeric primary packaging components and active packaging solutions.
Dispensing pumps are finger-actuated dispensing systems that dispense a spray or lotion from non-pressurized containers. The style of pump used depends largely on the nature of the product being dispensed, from small, fine mist pumps used with pharmaceutical products and perfume to lotion pumps for more viscous formulas.
Closures are primarily dispensing closures but to a lesser degree can include non-dispensing closures. Dispensing closures are plastic caps that allow a product to be dispensed without removing the cap.
Aerosol valves dispense product from pressurized containers. The majority of the aerosol valves that we sell are metered dose continuous spray valves, with the balance being bag-on valve and continuous spray valves.
We also manufacture and sell elastomeric primary packaging components. These components are used in the injectables market. Products include stoppers for infusion, antibiotic, lyophilization and diagnostic vials. Our elastomeric components also include pre-filled syringe components, such as plungers, needle shields, tip caps and cartridges, as well as dropper bulbs and syringe plungers.
We provide active packaging solutions via our material science technology which maintains the integrity of the container contents, extends shelf-life, controls moisture and reduces oxygenation. Our active packaging solutions remove gasses from the interior of the package environment and remove odor and other harmful contaminants. 
During 2020 and 2019, we acquired several companies to strengthen and broaden our portfolio, including the following business combinations and asset purchases:
-    October 2020 – Cohero Health, Inc. ("Cohero Health") asset purchase for cash paid at close of $2.4 million.
-    April 2020 – Fusion Packaging, Inc. ("Fusion") for cash paid at close of approximately $163.8 million (net of $1.0 million of cash acquired) and contingent consideration liability due to sellers related to earn-out.
-    October 2019 – Noble International Holdings, Inc., Genia Medical, Inc. and JBCB Holdings, LLC (collectively referred to as “Noble”) for cash paid at close of approximately $62.3 million (net of $1.6 million of cash acquired) and contingent consideration liability due to sellers related to earn-out. 
-    August 2019 – Bapco Closures Holdings Limited ("Bapco") for cash paid at close of $3.8 million (net of $2.9 million of cash acquired).
-    June 2019 – Nanopharm Ltd. (“Nanopharm”) for cash paid at close of approximately $38.1 million (net of $1.8 million of cash acquired).
-    May 2019 – Gateway Analytical LLC (“Gateway”) for cash paid at close of approximately $7.0 million and contingent consideration liability due to sellers related to earn-out.

DESCRIPTION OF OUR REPORTING SEGMENTS
INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS
Our organizational structure consists of three market-focused business segments: Pharma, Beauty + Home and Food + Beverage. This is a strategic structure which allows us to be more closely aligned with our customers and the markets in which they operate. We primarily sell our products and services through our own sales force to pharmaceutical, health care, beauty, personal care, home care, food and beverage marketers. To a limited extent, we use independent representatives and distributors to increase our reach to smaller customers and export markets.
Operations that sell dispensing systems, drug delivery systems, sealing solutions and services to the prescription drug, consumer health care, injectables and active packaging markets form the Pharma segment. Operations that sell dispensing systems and sealing solutions primarily to the beauty, personal care and home care markets form the Beauty + Home segment. Operations that sell dispensing systems and sealing solutions to the food and beverage markets form the Food + Beverage segment. Each of these three business segments is described more fully below.
PHARMA
The Pharma segment is our largest segment in terms of profitability, accounting for 68% of our Adjusted EBITDA excluding non-allocated corporate costs, and is our second largest segment in terms of net sales and total assets, accounting for 42% and 39% of our Net Sales and Total Assets, respectively, in 2020. We believe we are a leading supplier of nasal drug delivery spray pumps and metered dose inhaler valves (“MDIs”) to the pharmaceutical and health care markets worldwide and we are an important supplier of elastomer for injectable primary packaging components worldwide. Characteristics of this market include (i) governmental regulation of our pharmaceutical customers, (ii) contaminant-controlled manufacturing environments and (iii) a significant amount of time and research from initially working with pharmaceutical companies at the molecular development stage of a medication through the eventual distribution to the market. We have clean-room manufacturing facilities in Argentina, China, France, Germany, India, Switzerland and the United States. We believe that providing value-added, convenient drug delivery and dispensing systems will continue to offer opportunities for our business. In addition, we believe there are opportunities for growth in the over-the-counter and generic pharmaceutical categories.
Prescription Drug. Sales to the prescription drug market accounted for approximately 46% of the segment’s total net sales in 2020. Pumps sold to the prescription drug market deliver medications nasally, orally or topically. Currently the majority of our pumps sold are for nasal allergy treatments. Sales of pumps to deliver prescription allergy medicine that is now available over-the-counter remains part of our prescription drug division. This could provide us with growth opportunities as the movement to over-the-counter availability allows consumers easier access to these types of treatments. Our nasal pumps and unit dose and bidose devices are also used to deliver pain management and central nervous system therapies. 
MDIs are used for dispensing precise amounts of aerosolized medication. This technology allows medication to be broken up into very fine particles, which enables the drug to be delivered typically via the pulmonary route. Currently the majority of our MDIs sold are used for respiratory ailments such as asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
We continue to develop new drug delivery and dispensing systems and accessories in this segment. For example, we provide single dose delivery devices suitable for central nervous system applications. While we expect that these types of new products will come to market in the future, it is difficult to estimate when, as the rigors of pharmaceutical regulations affect the timing of product introductions by our pharmaceutical customers that use our drug delivery and dispensing systems.
Consumer Health Care. Sales to the consumer health care market accounted for approximately 22% of the segment’s total net sales in 2020. Many applications for this market are similar to the prescription market; however, these applications are sold over-the-counter without a prescription. Typical consumer health care spray applications include nasal decongestants, nasal salines and cough and cold applications. Typical consumer health care valve applications include nasal saline using our bag-on valve technology. We have developed a multi dose ophthalmic dispensing device suitable for unpreserved formulations. This technology is successfully marketed in Europe, North America and Latin America and is under development for other markets both for over-the-counter and prescription applications. Other products sold to this market include airless pump systems for dermal drug delivery applications. We have recently seen a trend to more child resistant and senior-friendly packaging solutions and have developed products to meet these market needs.
Injectables. Sales to the injectables market accounted for approximately 20% of the segment’s total net sales in 2020. Injectables are elastomeric primary packaging components for injectable drug delivery. Injectable products offered include stoppers for vials and pre-filled syringe components, such as plungers, needle shields, tip caps and components for cartridges. Our recent investment in this business allows us to market coated stoppers which better protect the contents of the vial and the integrity of biologic formulations. Pharmaceutical applications for this market include vaccines, anti-thrombotic, small molecules and biologics.

3/ATR | 2020 Form 10-K

Active Packaging. Active packaging is a technology Aptar acquired in 2018. Sales of active packaging products accounted for approximately 12% of the segment’s total net sales in 2020. Through proprietary material science expertise, we deliver active packaging solutions such as desiccant material to enhance the shelf life and effectiveness of diagnostic and solid dose products. Additionally, the technology is used to absorb moisture and oxygen as well as emit properties such as chlorine dioxide. 
BEAUTY + HOME
The Beauty + Home segment is our second largest segment in terms of profitability, accounting for 21% of our Adjusted EBITDA excluding non-allocated corporate costs, and is our largest segment in terms of net sales and total assets representing 44% and 40% of our Net Sales and Total Assets, respectively, in 2020. The Beauty + Home segment primarily sells pumps and decorative components to the beauty market and pumps, closures, aerosol valves, accessories and sealing solutions to the personal care and home care markets. We believe we are a leading supplier for the majority of the products we sell primarily to the beauty and personal care markets.
Beauty. Sales to the beauty market accounted for approximately 46% of the segment’s total net sales in 2020. The beauty market requires a broad range of spray and lotion pumps, closures, elastomeric flow-control components and sampling dispensing systems to meet functional as well as aesthetic requirements. A considerable amount of research and coordination with our customers is required to qualify a pump for use with their products. Within the market, we expect the use of pumps to continue to increase, particularly in the cosmetics and sampling sectors. In the cosmetic sector, packaging for certain products such as natural and organic cosmetics and anti-aging lotions continue to provide us with growth opportunities. We are a leading provider of packaging solutions for prestige and mass market fragrance products. Our cosmetic lotion pumps, airless dispensing systems, lotion sampling devices and decorative capabilities along with our focus on color cosmetics including lip stick and lip gloss products will also provide growth opportunities. We see significant opportunities for growth in the sale of our products for cosmetic skin care and color cosmetic applications in Asia.
Personal Care. Sales to the personal care market accounted for approximately 46% of the segment’s total net sales in 2020 and primarily included sales of lotion pumps, closures, fine mist spray pumps, continuous spray aerosol valves, and elastomeric flow-control components. Personal care lotion pump applications include hand sanitizers, soaps, cleaners, and skin moisturizers. Personal care closures applications include hand sanitizers, shampoos and conditioners. Typical spray pump applications include hair care, body care and sun care products. Personal care continuous spray aerosol valve applications include hair care products, deodorants, shaving creams and sun care products. Our research and development teams continue to design unique accessories that increase the value of our continuous spray aerosol valve offerings.
Home Care. Sales to the home care market accounted for approximately 8% of the segment’s total net sales in 2020 and primarily included sales of continuous or metered dose spray aerosol valves, closures and to a lesser degree spray and lotion pumps. Applications for continuous spray valves include disinfectants, spray paints, insecticides and automotive products. Metered dose valves are used for air fresheners. Closure applications include liquid detergents, automotive products and household cleansers. Spray and lotion pump applications primarily include household, insect repellent and industrial cleaners.
FOOD + BEVERAGE
The Food + Beverage segment is our smallest segment in terms of profitability, net sales and total assets, representing 11%, 14% and 14%, respectively, of our Adjusted EBITDA excluding non-allocated corporate costs, Net Sales and Total Assets in 2020. We primarily sell dispensing closures and, to a lesser degree, non-dispensing closures, elastomeric flow control components, spray pumps and aerosol valves.
Sales of dispensing closures have grown as consumers worldwide have demonstrated a preference for a package utilizing the convenience of a dispensing closure. At the same time, consumer marketers are trying to differentiate their products by incorporating performance enhancing features such as bonded aluminum liners to plastic, flow-control and no-drip dispensing, inverted packaging and directional flow to make packages simpler to use, cleaner and more appealing to consumers. We also have an increasing number of product solutions that address the increased use of flexible packaging formats.
Food. Sales to the food market accounted for approximately 75% of the segment’s total net sales in 2020 and primarily include sales of dispensing closures and elastomeric flow-control components. To a lesser degree we also sell non-dispensing closures, continuous spray aerosol valves and spray pumps to this market. Applications for dispensing closures include sauces, condiments, infant nutrition and other food products. Applications for continuous spray aerosol valves include cooking sprays. Spray pump applications primarily include butter sprays. We also leverage our material science technology to sell and further develop packaging solutions to the food service market to enhance the shelf life of those products.
Beverage. Sales to the beverage market accounted for approximately 25% of the segment’s total net sales in 2020 and primarily include sales of dispensing closures and elastomeric flow-control components. Sales of dispensing closures to the beverage market have increased significantly over the last several years as we continue to see an increase of interest from marketers using dispensing closures for their products. Examples of beverage products currently utilizing dispensing closures include bottled water, sport and energy drinks, juices and concentrated water flavorings.

GENERAL BUSINESS INFORMATION
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our commitment to innovation, one of our competitive strengths, has resulted in an emphasis on research and development directed toward developing affordable, new, sustainable and innovative packaging, drug delivery solutions and connected devices and adapting existing products for new markets or customer requirements. In certain cases, our customers share in the research and development expenses of customer initiated projects. Occasionally, we acquire or license from third parties technologies or products that are in various stages of development.
PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
We customarily seek patent and trademark protection for our products and brands. We own and currently have numerous applications pending for patents and trademarks in many regions of the world. In addition, certain of our products are produced under patent licenses granted by third parties. We believe that we possess certain technical capabilities and know-how that make our products difficult for a competitor to duplicate. While valuable to our overall product portfolio, sales of any one individually patented product are not considered material to any specific segment or to our consolidated results.
TECHNOLOGY
We have technical expertise regarding injection molding, robotics, clean-room facilities and high-speed assembly. We also have expertise regarding the formulation and finishing of elastomer and silicone components. In addition, we offer a variety of sterilization options for elastomeric components and active packaging technology based on proprietary material science expertise. Pumps and aerosol valves require the assembly of several different plastic, metal and rubber components using high-speed equipment. When molding dispensing closures, or plastic components to be used in pump or aerosol valve products, we use advanced plastic injection molding technology, including large cavitation plastic injection molds. We are able to mold within tolerances as small as one one-thousandth of an inch and we assemble products in a high-speed, cost-effective manner. We also provide analytical and connected device expertise within our pharma service technology businesses. 
MANUFACTURING AND SOURCING
The majority of our worldwide production is located outside of the United States. Our philosophy is to produce as much as possible in the region where it will be sold. In order to augment capacity and to maximize internal capacity utilization (particularly for plastic injection molding), we use subcontractors to supply certain plastic, metal and rubber components. Certain suppliers of these components have unique technical abilities that make us dependent on them, particularly for aerosol valve and pump production. The principal raw materials used in our production are plastic resins, silicone, rubber and certain metal products. We believe an adequate supply of such raw materials is available from existing and alternative sources. We attempt to offset cost increases through improving productivity and developing new, higher margin solutions and increasing selling prices, as allowed by market conditions or contractual commitments. We source certain materials, especially some resins and rubber components for our pharmaceutical segment, from a single source. Significant delays in receiving these components or discontinuance of an approved raw material would require us to seek alternative sources, which could result in higher costs as well as impact our ability to supply products in the short-term. While there have been some supply chain disruptions due to confinements through the pandemic, we have not been materially impacted by such disruptions.
CUSTOMERS
We have approximately 6,000 customers with no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounting for greater than 5% of 2020 Net Sales. From time to time our customer base experiences normal consolidation events and this trend is expected to continue. A concentration of customers presents opportunities for increasing sales due to the breadth of our product line, our international presence and our long-term relationships with certain customers. However, consolidation of our customers could lead to pricing pressures, concentration of credit risk and fewer opportunities to introduce new products to the market.
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
We are geographically diverse with manufacturing and sales operations in Asia, Europe, Latin America (including Mexico) and North America. Europe is our largest region in terms of sales, where sales (including exports) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately 55% and 57%, respectively, of our consolidated sales. Asia and Latin America when aggregated represented approximately 12% and 14% of our consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Export sales from the United States were $179.0 million and $170.0 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We are a net exporter of goods from Europe and a net importer of goods to the North American, Asian and Latin American regions.

5/ATR | 2020 Form 10-K

FOREIGN CURRENCY
Because of our international presence, movements in exchange rates have a significant impact on the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign exchange exposure is to the euro, but we have foreign exchange exposure to the Chinese yuan, Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Swiss franc and other Asian, European and South American currencies. A strengthening U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies has a dilutive translation effect on our financial statements. Conversely, a weakening U.S. dollar has an additive effect. We manage our exposures to foreign exchange principally with forward exchange contracts to economically hedge recorded transactions and firm purchase and sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we concluded that Argentina has become a highly inflationary economy primarily based on published estimates, which indicate that Argentina's three-year cumulative inflation rate has exceeded 100%. Beginning July 1, 2018, we applied highly inflationary accounting for our Argentinian subsidiary. We have changed the functional currency from the Argentinian peso to the U.S. dollar.
EMPLOYEE AND LABOR RELATIONS
Human Capital. Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, our human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit, and incentive programs; enhance our culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; and evolve and invest in technology, tools, and resources to enable employees at work.
As of December 31, 2020, AptarGroup has approximately 13,000 full-time employees. Of the full-time employees, approximately 7,900 are located in Europe, 2,600 are located in Asia and South America and the remaining 2,500 are located in North America. The majority of our European and Latin American employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements made at either the local or national level in their respective countries and approximately 60 of the North American employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The total labor force covered by a collective bargaining agreement represents 57% of the total employee population. Termination of employees at certain of our international operations could be costly due to local regulations regarding severance benefits. There were no material work stoppages in 2020 and management considers our employee relations to be satisfactory.
Employee Engagement. At AptarGroup, we conduct annual leadership for growth surveys. We have focused on organizational development based on our leadership principles, core values and strategic priorities. Our goal is to ensure that Aptar is well positioned for long-term growth and that we continue to be a high-performing, values-based, customer-focused company, with active commitments to innovation and sustainability. 
Employee Development & Leadership Succession. Developing our employees to reach their full potential is an integral part of our Core Values. We have a strong foundation of learning and development systems and leadership programs at our Corporate University. Our leadership programs are targeted at all levels of the organization, from early career to senior leadership globally. Our program offerings also include many specialized programs such as change management, manufacturing and operational leadership, technical skills and others. Aptar also has developed and deployed an integrated talent management system that includes annual talent reviews, three tiered succession planning, and individual development planning. Promotions from within provide career growth opportunities for our employees.
Diversity & Inclusion. At AptarGroup, our goal is to promote a diverse and inclusive culture. Approximately 40% of the Board of Directors is comprised of women and 100% of Board Committee chairs are women. During 2020, we appointed a Diversity & Inclusion Global Leader and trained over 75% of senior leadership in Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) content. Women comprise 37% of the global employee population and 18% at senior leadership levels. Aptar launched a global Women's Employee Resource Group with a focus on increasing women in leadership. Aptar is included in the SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE) which invests in companies that rank among the highest in gender diversity within senior leadership. Aptar is also a participant in the Catalyst CEO Champions for Change and the Gender and Diversity KPI Alliance. 
Employee Well-being & Safety. Employee safety and well-being is a primary focus of Aptar and was of particular interest during fiscal year 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic, we have taken a variety of measures to ensure the availability and functioning of our critical infrastructure, to promote the safety and security of our employees, and to support the communities in which we operate. These measures include requiring remote working arrangements for employees where practicable and implementing new safety protocols. We are following public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions, the promotion of social distancing, and the adoption of work-from-home arrangements. Additionally, we expanded employee assistance and mindfulness programs globally to help employees and their families manage anxiety, stress, and overall well-being. 

6/ATR | 2020 Form 10-K

COMPETITION
All of the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we continue to experience price competition in all product lines and markets. Competitors include privately and publicly held entities that range from regional to international companies. We expect the market for our products to remain competitive, as consolidation among our competitors is increasing in the current economic climate. We believe our competitive advantages are consistent high levels of innovation, quality and service, geographic diversity, financial strength and stability and breadth of products and services. Our manufacturing strength lies in the ability to mold complex plastic components and formulate and finish elastomer and silicone components in a cost-effective manner and to assemble products at high speeds. Our business is somewhat capital intensive and it is becoming more important to our customers that we have global manufacturing capabilities. Both of these serve as barriers to entry for new competitors wanting to enter our business. Furthermore, within our Pharma business, increasing regulatory hurdles present a barrier for new competitors to enter the market.
While we have experienced some competition in Europe, Latin America and the United States from low cost Asian suppliers, particularly in the beauty and personal care market, this has not been significant. Although using low cost Asian suppliers may have a cost advantage, some customers prefer local suppliers citing better quality, better customer service and shorter lead times. We have also recently reduced our carbon footprint due to shorter supply chain networks being utilized, which we see as a competitive advantage.
ENVIRONMENT
Our manufacturing operations primarily involve plastic injection molding, automated assembly processes, elastomer and silicone formulation and finishing and, to a limited degree, metal anodization and vacuum metallization of plastic components. Historically, the environmental impact of these processes has been minimal, and we believe we meet current environmental standards in all material respects. To date, our manufacturing operations have not been significantly affected by environmental laws and regulations relating to the environment.
Recently, we formalized our science-based targets setting an emissions reduction goal consistent with requirements to keep global warming well-below 2° Celsius by year 2030. This science-based approach incorporates our own operations and operations within the value chain. In addition, we annually undergo data assurance as part of our sustainability reporting. This assurance process allows for data on consumption of electricity, fuel oil, and natural gas, and renewable energy purchases to be verified for accuracy and completeness by an external organization. Globally this process is certified to the ISO 14064 standard for energy and greenhouse gas emission reporting.
Aptar was recognized for its actions to cut emissions, mitigate climate risks and further the low-carbon economy, based on the data reported by the Company through global environmental non-profit CDP's 2020 climate change questionnaire. Of more than 5,800 companies that were scored through the platform, Aptar is among the 273 companies securing a place on its prestigious 'A List' for tackling climate change. Through significant demonstrable action on climate change, Aptar is leading on corporate environmental ambition, action, and transparency worldwide.
There continues to be increased interest and awareness from consumers, and from our customers, in environmentally sustainable products, especially through the sourcing of sustainable materials. We are focused on reducing our environmental impacts through product life cycle assessments, sustainable material trials, operational eco-efficiency initiatives and renewable energy sourcing. We have teams dedicated to designing for sustainability by providing products that improve recyclability and use less material. Aptar has launched products and components in North America, Europe and Asia made with post-consumer recycled resins (PCR) and continues to explore additional opportunities for alternative resins and recyclable products.
We are actively collaborating with our customers on reliable products by supporting our customers’ participation in the circular e-commerce platform called “Loop,” in addition to being an investor in Loop ourselves. We also invested in and partnered with PureCycle, to prepare for the introduction of Ultra-Pure Recycled Polypropylene (UPRP) into dispensing applications.
Connecting with other companies through organizations like Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) provides an invaluable opportunity to share best practices and work on larger projects with aligned objectives towards a more circular economy.
Future regulations on environmental matters regarding recycling or material inputs could impact our business.

7/ATR | 2020 Form 10-K

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Certain of our products are directly or indirectly affected by government regulation. The European Union has adopted a circular economy package. The package maps out a series of actions planned over several years. Some actions have resulted in regulations aimed to reduce marine litter, increase plastic recycling rates, prohibit single-use plastic packaging and introduce new taxes in relation to the end-of-life management of packaging. In parts of the United States, regulations require food and beverage companies to tether plastic caps to ensure the caps stay with the package, thus improving the likelihood the caps will enter the recycling stream. The potential exists for these types of regulations to expand worldwide. We have established an innovation team that focuses on designing for and converting into more sustainable options like post-consumer recycled resin and Food and Drug Administration approved resin alternatives. We are designing for sustainability by providing products that improve recyclability and use less material, and we offer multiple tethered options. We are also partnering with global and regional thought leaders to drive a more circular economy.
The Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol plans to phase down hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) propellants from baseline to 15% in order to reduce greenhouse gas emission. This type of propellant is used for pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDI). The phase down plan has an exemption for pharmaceutical applications of pMDIs; however, customers are looking for alternative propellants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We are working with the suppliers of these alternative propellants and our customers to develop new solutions.
Future government regulations could include healthcare cost containment policies. For example, reviews by various governments to determine the number of drugs, or prices thereof, that will be paid by their insurance systems could affect future sales of our pharmaceutical customers’ products and thus adversely impact our sales to these customers. Such regulation could adversely affect prices of and demand for our pharmaceutical products. We believe that the focus on the cost effectiveness of the use of medications as compared to surgery and hospitalization provides us with an opportunity to expand sales to the pharmaceutical market.
