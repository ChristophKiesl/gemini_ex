Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of innovative, best-in-class therapies to improve the lives of patients with debilitating neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, including rare disorders. Our Neuroinnovation portfolio includes FDA-approved NURTEC ODT (rimegepant) for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine and a broad pipeline of product candidates across five distinct mechanistic platforms: calcitonin gene related peptide ("CGRP") receptor antagonism, glutamate modulation, myeloperoxidase ("MPO") inhibition, Kv7 Ion Channel Activators ("Kv7"), and Myostatin.
In November 2021, we entered into a strategic licensing and collaboration arrangement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Pfizer Inc. pursuant to which Pfizer would gain rights to commercialize rimegepant and zavegepant in all countries worldwide outside of the United States. The Collaboration Agreement became effective January 4, 2022. Refer to Note 19 "Subsequent Events" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information regarding the Collaboration Agreement.
Product Pipeline
Exclusive Commercial Product
The Migraine Research Foundation ranks migraine as the world's third most prevalent illness, with approximately 40 million individuals suffering from migraine attacks in the U.S., and 1 billion worldwide. While most sufferers experience migraine attacks once or twice per month, more than 4 million people in the U.S. alone have chronic migraine, defined as experiencing at least 15 headache days per month, of which at least eight are migraine, for more than three months. Others have episodic migraine, which is characterized by experiencing fewer than 15 migraine days per month. People with frequent episodes of migraine may progress to chronic migraine over time, thus migraine is a continuum disease.
Our exclusive commercial product, NURTEC ODT (rimegepant) for the acute treatment of migraine, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") on February 27, 2020 and became available by prescription in U.S. pharmacies on March 12, 2020. NURTEC ODT was also approved for the preventive treatment of migraine by the FDA on May 27, 2021. NURTEC ODT is the first and only medication proven to both treat and prevent migraine. We believe NURTEC ODT differentiates itself as a treatment in the migraine market because it allows patients and doctors to customize a single therapy to treat and prevent migraine attacks. It is further differentiated by its rapid onset and sustained efficacy for lasting migraine control. 
In a study of people who took either NURTEC ODT (669 people) or placebo (682 people), more people taking NURTEC ODT experienced pain freedom and freedom from their most bothersome symptom (selected from light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, or nausea) at 2 hours vs placebo. Additionally, more people taking NURTEC ODT experienced freedom from functional disability and pain relief as early as 60 minutes vs placebo. These benefits were sustained through 48 hours for some people.
We have been successful at capturing the value of NURTEC ODT and bringing NURTEC ODT to migraine suffers and have exceeded the greater than 400% revenue growth in the United States ("U.S.") of the oral CGRP class with over 600% product revenue growth in 2021 versus 2020. As of January 28, 2022, NURTEC ODT leads the oral CGRP market in total prescriptions ("TRx") at 51.2% share (source: IQVIA SMART). In addition, we continue to expand payer coverage, with NURTEC ODT covered by insurance providers reflecting 89% coverage, and over 240 million covered lives in all channels.
NURTEC ODT is providing fast and lasting relief to more and more migraine patients each day. The entire oral CGRP class is outperforming initial launch expectations and reflects the importance of these medications to individuals with migraine. NURTEC ODT is now the number one migraine treatment in its class.
Global Expansion of Rimegepant
We continue to aggressively expand the rimegepant franchise globally. Currently, there are four international regulatory approvals for rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine, two international regulatory approvals for rimegepant for the preventive treatment of migraine and twelve regulatory submissions for rimegepant for the acute and preventive treatments of migraine. On November 9, 2021, we announced a strategic collaboration with Pfizer for markets outside the U.S. The collaboration combines our neuroscience research and development expertise with Pfizer's commercialization and marketing excellence to pave the way to bring rimegepant's dual therapy innovation to as many of the 1 billion migraine sufferers around the world as possible.
Clinical Development Programs
 The following table summarizes our recent and expected future clinical development milestones for our product candidates. We hold the worldwide rights to all of our products and product candidates, including NURTEC ODT, which we have licensed to Pfizer to commercialize outside the United States for the treatment and prevention of migraine in accordance with the Collaboration Agreement. 
CGRP Platform
The CGRP receptor is located within pain-signaling pathways, intracranial arteries and mast cells and its activation is thought to play a causal role in migraine pathophysiology. For example, research and clinical studies have shown serum levels of CGRP are elevated during migraine attacks, infusion of intravenous CGRP produces persistent pain in migraine sufferers and non-migraine sufferers, and treatment with anti-migraine drugs normalizes CGRP activity. Additionally, multiple clinical studies show that small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, which inhibit the binding of endogenous CGRP to CGRP receptors, are effective in the acute treatment of migraine attacks. Treatment with a CGRP receptor antagonist is believed to relieve migraine through blocking neurogenic inflammation, decreasing artery dilation and inhibiting pain transmission. 
Rimegepant
Rimegepant is the most advanced product candidate from our CGRP receptor antagonist platform. It is an orally available, potent and selective small molecule human CGRP receptor antagonist that we developed for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine, and are developing for other non-migraine 

indications as well such as trigeminal neuralgia, rhinosinusitis, temporomandibular disorder ("TMD") and psoriasis. The Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant (NURTEC ODT) was approved by the FDA for the acute treatment of migraine on February 27, 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we submitted a supplemental New Drug Application ("sNDA") to the FDA for the use of rimegepant in the preventive treatment of migraine, which was approved on May 27, 2021.
 In February 2022, we announced positive top-line results from an Asia-Pacific, Phase 3 clinical trial of NURTEC ODT in adults for the acute treatment of migraine. Led by BioShin Limited, our subsidiary in China and South Korea, the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, regional, multi-center study met the co-primary endpoints evaluating the efficacy and safety of the ODT formulation of rimegepant, an oral CGRP receptor antagonist. This is the fifth positive pivotal study of rimegepant and the first to be conducted in Asia Pacific. The study met its co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain (p<0.0001) and freedom from most bothersome migraine‐associated symptom ("MBS") including either nausea, phonophobia or photophobia (p<0.0001) at 2-hours following a single oral dose of rimegepant. The early onset and durable 48 hour efficacy observed in China and South Korea was consistent with previous clinical trial results. In addition 


to the co-primary endpoints, NURTEC ODT demonstrated rapid onset efficacy that was superior to placebo on multiple clinically important outcomes, including: pain relief at 2 hours (p < 0.0001); normal functioning at 2 hours post-dose (p<0.0001); no need for rescue medication within 24 hrs of dosing (p < 0.0001), and showed lasting efficacy with sustained pain freedom from 2 through 24 hours (p < 0.0001) and sustained pain freedom from 2 through 48 hours (p < 0.0001). Initial analysis of topline data indicates NURTEC ODT was numerically advantaged compared to placebo on multiple early-onset measures, including: pain relief within 45 minutes and freedom from MBS within 45 minutes; return to normal function within 60 min; and pain freedom within 90 min. Rimegepant also showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile among study participants that was consistent with prior clinical trial results in the United States. Detailed data from the study will be presented at future medical meetings to help inform ongoing and future research. We expect to submit an NDA during the second half of 2022.
In February 2022, we were notified that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP"), a committee of the European Medicines Agency, adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization in the European Union ("EU") for rimegepant 75 mg (available as an orally dissolving tablet), intended for the prophylaxis and acute treatment of migraine. If approved, VYDURA (rimegepant) will be the commercial name for rimegepant in the EU. The full indication for VYDURA is the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults who have at least four migraine attacks per month. We expect to receive determination regarding our Marketing Authorization Application in the EU for rimegepant in the first half of 2022.
Zavegepant
Zavegepant represents a novel chemical structure compared to other small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists in development (including rimegepant). We are developing zavegepant for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine as well as respiratory complications and non-migraine studies, with initial studies being conducted in acute treatment. We believe it has the potential to improve the existing standard of care based on its multiple potential routes of delivery, favorable safety profile, superior chemical attributes, higher value to patients and payors and potential for multiple indications. 
In December 2021, we announced top-line results from our Phase 3 trial for the use of intranasal zavegepant for the acute treatment of migraine. The results of the study showed that zavegepant was statistically superior to placebo on the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (24% vs 15%, p <.0001) and freedom from most bothersome symptom (40% vs 31%, p = 0.0012) at 2 hours. Zavegepant was superior to placebo demonstrating pain relief as early as 15 minutes, with patients achieving return to normal 

function as early as 30 minutes after dosing (p < 0.006). The efficacy benefits of zavegepant were durable, including superiority versus placebo (p < 0.05) on: sustained pain freedom 2 to 24 hours; sustained pain freedom 2 to 48 hours; sustained pain relief 2 to 24 hours; and sustained pain relief 2 to 48 hours. Based upon these results, combined with our prior positive Phase 2/3 trial, we plan to proceed with regulatory submissions in the United States and other countries and expect to submit a New Drug Application ("NDA") for zavegepant with the FDA in the first half of 2022.
Our Phase 2/3 trial for the use of oral zavegepant for the preventive treatment of migraine is ongoing, with results expected in the second half of 2022.
Next Generation CGRP Receptor Antagonists
In November 2020, we entered into a global collaboration and license agreement with Heptares Therapeutics Ltd. ("Sosei Heptares"), an international biopharmaceutical group focused on the discovery and early development of new medicines originating from their proprietary GPCR-targeted StaR technology and structure-based drug design platform capabilities. Under the agreement, Sosei Heptares will be eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties on net sales of products resulting from the collaboration. In return, we will receive exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a portfolio of novel, small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists discovered by Sosei Heptares for the treatment of CGRP-mediated disorders, including non-migraine indications. The portfolio included the lead candidate HTL0022562, referred to as BHV-3100, which had advanced through preclinical development demonstrating promising and differentiated properties for further investigation in human trials. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we decided to stop development of BHV-3100 based upon its emerging preclinical profile and will instead advance one of the portfolio's backup compounds in its place.
Glutamate Platform
Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter present in over 90% of all brain synapses and is a naturally occurring molecule that nerve cells use to send signals to other cells in the central nervous system. Glutamate plays an essential role in normal brain functioning and its levels must be tightly regulated. Abnormalities in glutamate function can disrupt nerve health and communication, and in extreme cases may lead to nerve cell death.
Troriluzole
Troriluzole is a new chemical entity ("NCE") and tripeptide prodrug of the active metabolite, riluzole. Based on its mechanism of action, preclinical data and clinical studies, troriluzole has potential for therapeutic benefit in a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric illnesses. We believe troriluzole offers potential advantages, compared to orally dosed riluzole including 


improved bioavailability, no negative food effect, lower overall drug burden to the liver, optimized dosing regimen and compliance and potential for developing multiple formulations.
Spinocerebellar Ataxia
Our initial development has focused on the use of troriluzole in treating SCA, an orphan neurological disease characterized by problems with coordination, balance and movement. Currently there are no approved drug therapies for SCA. SCA was chosen as the lead indication based on a strong preclinical rationale as well as demonstration of preliminary efficacy of the active metabolite in troriluzole, riluzole, in two randomized controlled trials in patients with SCA and other ataxias conducted by third parties (Ristori 2010; Romano 2015). We have received both orphan drug designation and fast track designation from the FDA for troriluzole for the treatment of SCA.
Initially, we had conducted a Phase 2b/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to assess the safety and efficacy of troriluzole over 8 weeks in subjects with SCA. In October 2017, we announced that troriluzole at a dose of 140 mg QD did not differentiate from placebo on the primary endpoint of the mean change from baseline on the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) total score after 8 weeks of treatment. During open-label treatment over the 48-week extension phase, however, troriluzole did show slowing of disease progression in troriluzole-treated subjects in contrast to the measurable decline expected for a cohort of untreated subjects based on the natural history of the disease. An expanded open-label extension phase for this study is ongoing. Based on our learnings from the Phase 2b/3 study, including analyses from the open-label extension phase, we are now conducting a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to assess the safety and efficacy of troriluzole over 48 weeks in subjects with SCA. We enriched this trial with specific SCA genotypes, extended the treatment period of this trial to 48 weeks, implemented the use of a modified SARA scale, and increased the dose of troriluzole to 200 mg QD. We believe that these changes may improve the ability of the trial to more accurately evaluate troriluzole's benefit in slowing disease progression in patients with SCA. In March 2019, we announced the initiation of the trial, which subsequently completed enrollment in the first quarter of 2021, with results expected in the first half of 2022.
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
We are developing troriluzole for OCD, which is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms of obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors) that can interfere with patients' functional abilities. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the 12-month prevalence of OCD is 1% of the U.S. adult population, and approximately half of these cases are characterized 

as severe. First-line treatment for OCD includes cognitive behavior therapy, SSRIs and adjunctive use of atypical antipsychotics. Nonetheless, up to 60% of patients have an inadequate response to conventional intervention strategies. In multiple case studies, the use of the active metabolite in troriluzole, riluzole, in patients with refractory OCD has commonly been associated with meaningful improvement of symptoms. 
A Phase 2/3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy of troriluzole in OCD commenced in December 2017. Enrollment in this study was completed in the first quarter of 2020. The Phase 2/3 study results were announced in June 2020. Troriluzole 200 mg administered once daily as adjunctive therapy in OCD patients with inadequate response to standard of care treatment showed consistent numerical improvement over placebo on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) at all study time points (weeks 4 to 12) but did not meet the primary outcome measure at week 12 (p = 0.22 at week 12) but was significant at week 8 (p < 0.05). Troriluzole was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with past clinical trial experience. Given the strong signal in our Phase 2/3 proof of concept study and after receiving feedback from the FDA in an End of Phase 2 meeting, in December 2020 we initiated enrollment in the Phase 3 program. Two Phase 3 studies are currently ongoing with results expected in the second half of 2022.
Alzheimer’s Disease
We conducted a clinical trial of troriluzole for Alzheimer's disease, a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative dementia. It accounts for up to 80% of dementias. According to the Alzheimer's Association, in 2016 there were approximately 5.5 million people in the United States with the disease, and that number is expected to escalate rapidly in the coming years as the population ages. Observations in multiple preclinical models, suggested the active metabolite of troriluzole, riluzole, protects from Alzheimer's-related pathology and cognitive dysfunction.
In January 2021, we announced top-line results from the study. Troriluzole did not statistically differentiate from placebo at 48 weeks on the study's prespecified co-primary endpoints on the ADAS-cog and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) in study participants with mild-to-moderate AD. Troriluzole also did not differentiate from placebo on the key secondary measure of hippocampal volume assessed by MRI in the overall population. A subgroup analysis consisting only of mild AD patients did, however, reveal that troriluzole exhibited a nonsignificant numerical difference of a potential benefit at week 48 on both the ADAS-cog and hippocampal volumetric MRI. With regard to safety and tolerability, treatment with troriluzole at a dose of 280 mg once daily was relatively well tolerated and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous studies of troriluzole. In December 2021, we completed an ongoing long-term extension study of troriluzole in AD for mild AD patients.


Other Indications Being Pursued by our Collaborators
Our collaborators are exploring the potential applicability of troriluzole beyond cerebellar and neuropsychiatric indications, including in melanoma (Rutgers University and Dana Farber Cancer Institute) and glioblastoma (Johns Hopkins University/Stanford University). The oncology collaborations with Rutgers and Johns Hopkins/Stanford University are based upon the mechanistic rationale that some tumors overexpress glutamate receptors, the central role that glutamate may have in cancer metabolism and the effect of glutamate on the tumor microenvironment.
In December 2021, the Global Coalition for Adaptive Research ("GCAR") selected troriluzole for evaluation in Glioblastoma Adaptive Global Innovative Learning Environment - NCT03970447 ("GBM AGILE"). GBM AGILE is a revolutionary patient-centered, adaptive platform trial for registration that tests multiple therapies for patients with newly-diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma ("GBM"). Troriluzole will be evaluated in all patient subgroups of the trial which include newly-diagnosed methylated MGMT, newly-diagnosed unmethylated MGMT, and recurrent GBM. Troriluzole was selected for inclusion in GBM AGILE based on compelling evidence showing deregulation of glutamate in GBM. The therapeutic potential of troriluzole in GBM and other oncology indications is supported by several recent clinical and translational research studies conducted with troriluzole and its active moiety.
BHV-5000 and BHV-5500
An N-methyl-D-aspartate ("NMDA") receptor antagonist is a type of glutamate antagonist that works to inhibit the action of NMDA receptors which may play a role in degenerative diseases that affect the brain. BHV-5000 is an oral prodrug of the intravenous drug lanicemine, also referred to as BHV-5500. In addition to being orally available, BHV-5000 is a first-in-class, low-trapping, NMDA receptor antagonist with differentiating pharmacologic properties from other agents in development targeting this receptor. Results from nonclinical studies limiting clinical dose of BHV-5000 have led us to focus on formulation development of BHV-5500 (lanicemine).
Rett Syndrome 
Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from an X-linked dominant gene mutation ("MECP2"). As a result, it occurs almost exclusively in females. After six to 18 months of apparently normal development, patients with Rett syndrome show global deceleration of psychomotor development and subsequent loss of acquired cognitive and motor skills, such as the loss of speech. Rett syndrome occurs in all racial and ethnic groups and occurs worldwide in approximately 1 in every 10,000 live female births. There are approximately 15,000 females with Rett syndrome in the United States. No approved 

treatments for Rett syndrome are currently available and standard of care is supportive.
BHV-5000 and lanicemine have been observed to ameliorate the phenotype in transgenic mouse models of Rett syndrome, models which recapitulate key clinical features, such as irregular breathing, apneic periods, and abnormal electroencephalogram ("EEG") with altered seizure threshold. Based on the preclinical experience, we have chosen to advance BHV-5000 into clinical trials for the treatment of breathing irregularities associated with Rett syndrome. 
In July 2017, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for BHV-5000 for the treatment of patients with Rett syndrome. Our clinical program for BHV-5000 will build upon AstraZeneca's previous development efforts for lanicemine. In support, BHV-5000 is rapidly metabolized to lanicemine and, in a Phase 1 trial, concentrations of BHV-5000 were detectable in only a few subjects who received the highest dose. As a result, we intend to rely on long-term Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP") toxicology, reproductive toxicology and carcinogenicity studies of lanicemine to potentially expedite the safety package for BHV-5000.
Currently, we are conducting neurotoxicology studies that are required for NMDA antagonist drugs to define acceptable clinical exposures. Based on these results, an additional Phase 1 study may be required to establish the dose that would subsequently be used in a randomized controlled trial of BHV-5000. One of our planned indications for BHV-5000 is Rett syndrome, based on the ability of BHV-5000 and its active metabolite to favorably impact breathing abnormalities and global brain biochemical abnormalities in transgenic mouse models. Potential other conditions include depression, neuropathic pain and other disorders involving NMDA receptor dysfunction.
Major Depressive Disorder
Major depressive disorder ("MDD") is the leading cause of disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. In the United States, the prevalence rate is approximately 7%. Despite the approval of over two dozen agents, therapeutic effects are limited. More than one-third of patients who complete an initial course of antidepressant treatment will not achieve a satisfactory response, and as many as 20% of patients have chronic depression despite multiple interventions. Clinical findings of antidepressant effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine have provided a link between the NMDA receptor function and depression and a rationale for testing BHV-5000 as an antidepressant. 
Neuropathic Pain
Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition caused by dysfunctional or damaged nerves. Neuropathic pain can be a debilitating and common problem affecting approximately 10% of adults in the United States. Despite the availability of multiple approved drugs, 


including Lyrica, and guidelines for the treatment of neuropathic pain, treatment of this condition remains a major therapeutic challenge. Existing analgesics are often ineffective, can cause serious side effects and have abuse potential that limits widespread use. Increased NMDA receptor activity is known to contribute to central sensitization in neuropathic pain. NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to reduce hyperalgesia and pain in animal models of neuropathic pain induced by nerve injury and diabetic neuropathy. Clinically used NMDA receptor antagonists, including ketamine and dextromethorphan, can be effective in patients suffering from neuropathic pain syndromes. The clinical use of robust NMDA antagonists, such as ketamine, is limited due to dissociative, psychotomimetic and abuse potential properties. Novel NMDA receptor antagonists, such as BHV-5000, that are not associated with the psychotomimetic effects and abuse potential could lead to better management of neuropathic pain without causing serious side effects.
MPO Platform
Verdiperstat 
Verdiperstat is a first-in-class, potent, selective, brain-permeable, irreversible MPO. MPO generates an array of cytotoxic oxidants and is a key driver of oxidative and inflammatory processes that underlie a broad range of disorders. MPO plays a key role in neurodegenerative, inflammatory, and immune-mediated diseases, including MSA, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, ischemic and hemorrhagic forms of stroke, epilepsy, depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Clinical and experimental studies have revealed the detrimental role of MPO. Hence, suppressing MPO may be a novel treatment approach for these disorders. In February 2019, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of Multiple System Atrophy ("MSA"). Verdiperstat has also received orphan drug designation for the treatment of MSA from the European Commission upon recommendation from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products.
Multiple System Atrophy
MSA is an orphan disease that is an adult-onset, fatal, neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive autonomic failure, parkinsonian features, and cerebellar and pyramidal features in various combinations and degrees of severity. It invariably leads to death after an average of 6 to 10 years from symptom onset. No disease-modifying treatment currently exists; only symptomatic and palliative approaches are available.
A Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of verdiperstat in participants with MSA began enrollment in July 2019. Ambulatory participants, 40-80 years of age, with possible or probable MSA, 

including MSA-P or MSA-C, are randomized to 48 weeks of treatment with verdiperstat 600-mg BID or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline to Week 48 in verdiperstat- vs. placebo-treated participants on a score derived from the Unified MSA Rating Scale, optimized based on FDA guidance to assess clinically meaningful change in ability to function. Between July 2019 and July 2020, 336 participants with MSA were enrolled at 48 sites across 6 countries (US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Austria). In September 2021, we announced that Verdiperstat did not statistically differentiate from placebo on the prespecified primary efficacy measure, nor on the key secondary efficacy measures. Initial analysis of safety data was consistent with the overall profile of verdiperstat from prior clinical trial experience. Additional analyses are still pending, and full study results will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
Another potential target indication for verdiperstat is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ("ALS"). In September 2019, we announced that verdiperstat was selected to be studied in the pivotal HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, which is being conducted by the Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS at MGH (“Healey Center”) in collaboration with the Northeast ALS Consortium (“NEALS”) clinical trial network. Promising investigational drugs were chosen for the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial through a competitive process, with the Healey Center providing partial financial support to successful applicants. The HEALEY ALS Platform Trial is a perpetual multi-center, multi-regimen clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of investigational products for the treatment of ALS. HEALEY ALS Platform Trial Regimen B is evaluating the safety and efficacy of verdiperstat in approximately 160 adults with ALS. Participants were randomized in a 3-to-1 ratio treated with verdiperstat 600 mg BID or placebo for 24 weeks. The study's primary efficacy endpoint measures the change in disease severity from baseline to week 24 on the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised in patients receiving treatment versus placebo. Secondary endpoints include change in respiratory function, muscle strength, and survival. In August 2020, we announced that the first patients were enrolled in the pivotal HEALEY ALS Platform Trial Regimen B. Enrollment in the trial was completed in November of 2021, with results expected mid-2022.
Kv7 Platform 
BHV-7000
In February 2022, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with Channel Biosciences, LLC, a subsidiary of Knopp Biosciences, LLC, to acquire a Kv7 channel targeting platform, adding the latest advances in ion-channel modulation to our growing neuroscience portfolio. BHV-7000 (formerly known as KB-3061) is the lead asset from the Kv7 platform and is a potentially best-in-class potassium channel activator 


with a profile suggestive of a wide therapeutic index, high selectivity, and significantly reduced GABA-ergic activity. We intend to bring BHV-7000 to the clinic in in 2022 in preparation for a development program in focal epilepsy.
Myostatin Platform
Taldefgrobep Alfa License Agreement
In February 2022, following the transfer of intellectual property we announced that we entered into a worldwide license agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("BMS") for the development and commercialization rights to taldefgrobep alfa (also known as BMS-986089), a novel, Phase 3-ready anti-myostatin adnectin. Myostatin is a natural protein that limits skeletal muscle growth, an important process in healthy muscular development. However, in patients with neuromuscular diseases, active myostatin can critically limit the growth needed to achieve developmental and functional milestones. Myostatin inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing muscle mass and strength in a range of pediatric and adult neuromuscular conditions. Taldefgrobep is a muscle-targeted treatment for neuromuscular disease and offers the opportunity for combination therapy. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of taldefgrobep in Spinal Muscular Atrophy ("SMA") in 2022. SMA is a rare, progressively debilitating motor neuron disease in which development and growth of muscle mass are compromised, resulting in progressive weakness and muscle atrophy, reduced motor function, impaired quality of life and often death. The in-licensing of taldefgrobep expands our portfolio of innovative, late-stage product candidates for the treatment of neurologic, neuroinflammatory, and psychiatric indications.
Biohaven Labs
Kleo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Biohaven Labs
In January 2021, we acquired the remaining approximately 58% of Kleo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Kleo") that we did not previously own. We have assumed Kleo's laboratory facilities located in Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut and formed Biohaven Labs to serve as the integrated chemistry and discovery research arm of Biohaven. Biohaven Labs will continue several existing Kleo discovery partnerships, including one with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the development of a Hyperimmune Globulin Mimic for COVID-19 and PeptiDream for the development of immuno-oncology therapeutics. 
Our proprietary Multimodal Antibody Therapy Enhancer ("MATE") conjugation technology uses a new class of synthetic peptide binders to target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that are then selectively conjugated to commercially available intravenous immunoglobulin. The Biohaven synthetic binders for SARS-CoV2 were designed to establish a much wider area and number of contacts with the spike protein that 

other agents like monoclonal antibodies. In February 2021, we announced that BHV-1200 developed with our proprietary MATE platform has demonstrated functional binding and neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the strains known as the "English" and "South African" variants (also known as B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, respectively). The preliminary experiments conducted by Biohaven Labs and an academic collaborator demonstrated that BHV-1200 substantially reduced viral entry into cells. We intend to advance BHV-1200 into a full clinical development program. Accelerated development of the COVID-19 MATE program has been supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In addition, the in vitro data indicated that BHV-1200 may activate important immune system components including antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. We believe our proprietary MATE-conjugation technology could also be used against other infectious diseases by changing the targeting moiety of its antibody binders.
TDP-43
In May 2019, we entered into an agreement with Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center Inc. (“FCCDC”) for FCCDC’s TDP-43 assets (the “FCCDC Agreement”). The FCCDC Agreement provides us with a plan and goal to identify one or more new chemical entity candidates for preclinical development for eventual clinical evaluation for the treatment of one or more TDP-43 proteinopathies. In connection with the FCCDC Agreement, Biohaven and FCCDC have established a TDP-43 Research Plan that provides for certain milestones to be achieved by FCCDC, and milestone payments to be made by Biohaven.
University of Connecticut License Option
In October 2018, we signed an exclusive, worldwide option and license agreement with the University of Connecticut for the development and commercialization rights to UC1MT, a therapeutic antibody targeting extracellular metallothionein ("MT"). Extracellular MT has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Under this agreement, we have the option to acquire an exclusive, worldwide license to UC1MT and its underlying patents to develop and commercialize throughout the world in all human indications.
Artizan Biosciences Inc License Option
In December 2020, we entered into an Option and License Agreement with Artizan Biosciences Inc ("Artizan"), a biotechnology company focused on addressing inflammatory diseases involving the human intestinal microbiota. Pursuant to the agreement, we acquired an option to obtain a royalty-based license from Artizan to manufacture, use and commercialize certain products. Artizan will use the proceeds to continue advancing the preclinical research and development of its lead program for inflammatory bowel 


disease, which is anticipated to enter the clinic in 2022, as well as to explore additional disease targets.
BHV-1100
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated a Phase 1a/1b trial in multiple myeloma patients using its antibody recruiting molecule ("ARM") BHV-1100 in combination with autologous cytokine induced memory-like ("CIML") natural killer (NK) cells and immune globulin ("IG") to target and kill multiple myeloma cells expressing the cell surface protein CD38. BHV-1100 is the lead clinical asset from our ARM™ Platform developed from a strategic alliance with PeptiDream Inc. (TYO: 4587). This clinical trial will assess the safety and tolerability as well as exploratory efficacy endpoints in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who have tested positive for minimal residual disease ("MRD+") in first remission prior to autologous stem cell transplant ("ASCT").
Reliant Glycosciences, LLC
In July 2021, we entered into a development and license agreement with Reliant Glycosciences, LLC ("Reliant") for collaboration on a program with Biohaven Labs’ multifunctional molecules to develop and commercialize conjugated antibodies for therapeutic uses relating to IgA nephropathy and other diseases and conditions. Under the Agreement, Reliant was entitled to an upfront payment and will be eligible to receive development milestone payments and royalties on net sales of licensed products.
KU Leuven
In January 2022, Biohaven and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven ("KU Leuven") entered into an Exclusive License and Research Collaboration Agreement (the "KU Leuven Agreement") to develop and commercialize first-in-class TRPM3 antagonists to address the growing proportion of people worldwide living with chronic pain disorders. The TRPM3 antagonist platform was discovered at the Centre for Drug Design and Discovery ("CD3") and the Laboratory of Ion Channel Research ("LICR") at KU Leuven. Under the KU Leuven Agreement, Biohaven receives exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize KU Leuven's portfolio of small-molecule TRPM3 antagonists. The portfolio includes the lead candidate, henceforth known as BHV-2100, which has demonstrated promising efficacy in preclinical pain models and will be the first to advance towards Phase 1 studies. Biohaven will support further basic and translational research at KU Leuven on the role of TRPM3 in pain and other disorders.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition 

from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their safety, efficacy, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Many of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Manufacturing
We have an experienced manufacturing leadership team that manages our relationships with third party manufacturers. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing of our products.
Our lead product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
Biohaven Pharmaceutical Ireland DAC (“Biohaven Ireland") will be the supplier for Pfizer sales of rimegepant and zavegepant ("the Licensed Products") in all countries worldwide outside the U.S. ("the Territory"). As part of our Collaboration Agreement, Pfizer was granted a co-exclusive, royalty-bearing license for patent rights and know-how to develop and manufacture the Licensed Products in the Territory. 


Commercialization Strategy
We have commercialized NURTEC ODT for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine in the United States, and we intend to commercialize our product candidates if approved by regulators. In November 2021, we signed a collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer pursuant to which Pfizer has the exclusive right to commercialize product candidates containing rimegepant and may elect to commercialize zavegepant in territories outside the United States. In the future, we may enter into additional distribution or licensing arrangements for commercialization rights for other product candidates.
With respect to commercializing NURTEC ODT and zavegepant in the United States, we recruited a seasoned team of sales specialists, account directors and field medical professionals who are focused on targeting health care professionals and institutions serving patients with migraine, including neurologists, headache centers/specialists and primary care. Our commercial organization has grown as expected following our first full year of NURTEC ODT net sales in 2021 to meet the increasing sales demands of NURTEC ODT.
With respect to the product candidates in our glutamate modulation and MPO platforms, if approved for commercialization by the FDA, we are confident of significant provider/stakeholder overlap which will create synergies with our current commercial footprint to maximize coverage, opportunity, and efficiencies.
Customers
Our customers are primarily comprised of pharmaceutical wholesale distributors. Our net product sales to three customers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation, and Cardinal Health, Inc., each accounted for more than 10.0% of our total net product sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 92% and 98%, respectively.
In connection with our Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer, Pfizer agreed to, among other things, provide us with tiered, escalating royalties from the upper teens to twenty percent of net sales of the Licensed Products in the Territory. In general, Pfizer's obligation to pay royalties continues on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest of ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country, or the expiration of the patent rights covering such product in such country or the expiration of the period of exclusivity applicable to such product in such country. The Collaboration Agreement did not result in the recognition of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Intellectual Property
We own or license patents in the U.S. and foreign countries that protect our products, their methods of 

use and manufacture, as well as other innovations relating to the advancement of our science to help bring new therapies to patients. We also develop brand names and trademarks for our products to differentiate them in the marketplace. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks, licenses and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain the proprietary position of our products and development programs.
In the biopharmaceutical industry, a substantial portion of an innovative product’s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. A product’s market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovative drug is entitled.
Patents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the medicine. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, discovery tools, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.
Market exclusivity can also be influenced by regulatory data protection ("RDP"). Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for the development of medicines. For example, in the U.S., the EU, United Kingdom, Japan, and certain other countries, RDP intellectual property rights are offered to: (i) provide a time period of data protection during which a generic company is not allowed to rely on the innovator’s data in seeking approval; (ii) restore patent term lost during drug development and approval; and (iii) provide incentives for research on medicines for rare diseases, or orphan drugs, and on medicines useful in treating pediatric patients. These incentives can extend the market exclusivity period on a product beyond the patent term.


Patents and Patent Applications
We have over 1,000 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications in our portfolio related to the composition of matter, methods of use, methods of manufacture or formulations of our product candidates which have been filed in major markets throughout the world, including the United States, Europe, Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong and Australia.
Rimegepant and Zavegepant
The intellectual property rights related to rimegepant and zavegepant include patents and patent applications in-licensed from BMS, with expiration dates of February 22, 2031 for rimegepant, and October 7, 2031 for zavegepant, not including eligible patent term extensions, and patent applications filed by the Company, which if granted, will have statutory expiration dates from 2039 and later. U.S. Patent 8,314,117 covers the composition of matter of rimegepant, and has an expiration date of February 22, 2031, including patent term adjustment but not including any potential patent term extension. Based on the FDA’s approval of NURTEC ODT (rimegepant sulfate) orally disintegrating tablets on February 27, 2020, a request for Patent Term Extension under 35 U.S.C.156 of the United States Code was filed for U.S. Patent 8,314,117. If the application is granted as filed, the term of U.S. Patent 8,314,117 will be extended to February 27, 2034, not including a potential additional six month period of pediatric exclusivity. On August 10, 2021, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued U.S. Patent 11,083,724 which, among other things, is directed to ODT forms of CGRP antagonists, including rimegepant. This patent has an expiration date of March 25, 2039 in the U.S. and is pending in other countries. U.S. Patent 8,481,546 covers the composition of matter of zavegepant, and has an expiration date of October 7, 2031, including patent term adjustment but not including any potential patent term extension. These and other patents and applications cover rimegepant and zavegepant and their use in treating migraine and other neurological conditions. The BMS license also includes several patent families of related compounds directed to the CGRP receptor. We also have an agreement with Catalent whereby Catalent granted an exclusive license under certain of its patents and technology to use the Zydis ODT technology for development of our rimegepant product.
Troriluzole
We own a portfolio of patents and patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries directed to prodrugs of riluzole, including among others U.S. Patent 10,485,791, issued November 26, 2019, which is directed to troriluzole and other prodrugs of riluzole. In addition, the use of these compounds for treating ALS, SCA, depression and other diseases is described and claimed in these patents and patent applications. We own these patent applications subject to an agreement with ALS Biopharma and FCCDC. In addition, we have filed patent applications relating to drug product formulations containing trorilizole and methods of using the formulations to treat various diseases.

Next Generation CGRP Receptor Antagonists
We have in-licensed patents and patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries directed to CGRP receptor antagonists developed by Sosei Heptares pursuant to a Collaboration and License Agreement dated November 30, 2020. The patents and patent applications disclose novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treating various diseases including those other than migraine such as pain, hot flashes, cluster headache and other CGRP-mediated cerebrovascular and vascular disorders. The patents and patent applications include, for example, U.S. Patents 9,808,457 and 10,300,056 which expire on October 28, 2036 not including eligible patent term extensions.
BHV-5000
We have also in-licensed patents and patent applications directed to BHV-5000 from AstraZeneca. They contain claims directed to the prodrug form of lanicemine, BHV-5000, as well as the use of the prodrug in treating a variety of neurological diseases including Rett syndrome and depression. Three U.S. patents have been granted that are directed to BHV-5000 and its composition and uses and have a statutory expiration date in 2034. Corresponding foreign patents are granted in Europe, Japan, China, and other countries.
Verdiperstat
In September 2018, we in-licensed patents from AstraZeneca relating to the composition of matter of verdiperstat, pharmaceutical compositions and various neurological diseases including muscular system atrophy. The patent applications have been filed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other countries. Three U.S. patents have been granted. The pending applications and granted patents have expiration dates from 2025 to 2034, not including possible patent term extensions.
Licensing and Other Agreements
In addition to our independent efforts to develop and market products, we enter into agreements such as licensing agreements, option-to-license agreements and strategic collaborations. The licensing and other agreements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and royalties. See Note 14, "Licensing and Other Agreements," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information regarding our licenses and other agreements.
Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the 


expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including imposition of a clinical hold, refusal by the FDA to approve applications, withdrawal of an approval, import/export delays, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are governed by extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The FDA, under the FDCA, regulates pharmaceutical products in the United States. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:
•preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP");
•the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug ("IND") application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence;
•approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB"), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
•adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each indication and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices ("GCP");
•the preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
•FDA acceptance, review and approval of the NDA, which might include an Advisory Committee review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are made to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMPs").
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain. The FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various 

grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Preclinical and Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of the product candidate, as well as in vitro and animal studies to gather information on the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of preclinical trials is subject to federal regulations and requirements including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced. The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. The FDA may nevertheless initiate a clinical hold after the 30 days if, for example, significant public health risks arise.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at each of the sites at which the trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution.
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap or be combined. These phases generally include the following:
Phase 1.    Phase 1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently healthy volunteers. In Phase 1, the product candidate is usually tested for safety, including adverse effects, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacodynamics.
Phase 2.    Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to (1) evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications, (2) determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
Phase 3.    If a product candidate is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 clinical trials, the clinical trial program will be expanded to Phase 3 clinical trials to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
Phase 4.    Clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic 


indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post-market requirements or commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in enforcement action or withdrawal of approval.
A Phase 2/3 trial design, which we have used in our zavegepant and troriluzole development programs, is often used in the development of pharmaceutical and biological products. The trial includes Phase 2 elements, such as an early interim analysis of safety or activity, and Phase 3 elements, such as larger patient populations with less restrictive enrollment criteria. The early interim analysis of clinical or physiologic activity and/or safety allows the study to be stopped, changed or continued before a large number of patients have been enrolled, while still allowing all data from enrolled patients to count in the analysis used to support approval.
Submission and Review of an NDA
The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the product's manufacture, composition, quality, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, requesting approval to market the product. The application must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment, which typically increases annually, although waivers may be granted in limited cases. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept an application if they determine that the data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.
Once an NDA has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission, the FDA sets a user fee goal date that informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review. This is typically 10 months from the date that the FDA accepts the application for filing for standard review NDAs and 6 months from the date that the FDA accepts the application for filing for priority review NDAs. The review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities comply with cGMPs. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites, as well as the Sponsor of the NDA, for compliance with GCP and integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy.
During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy ("REMS") is necessary to assure the safe use of the product post approval. If the FDA concludes a REMS 

is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS, and the FDA will not approve the application without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval. The FDA could also require a special warning, known as a boxed warning, to be included in the product label in order to highlight a particular safety risk. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit and interpretation of clinical trial data. The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and/or the FDA requires additional testing or information. The FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
On the basis of the FDA's evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA will issue either an approval of the NDA or a Complete Response Letter ("CRL"), detailing the deficiencies in the submission and the additional testing or information required for reconsideration of the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
Approved drugs that are manufactured or distributed in the United States pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims and some manufacturing and supplier changes are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for marketed products.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The FDA may also require a REMS, which could involve requirements for, among other things, medication guides, special trainings for prescribers and dispensers, patient registries, and elements to assure safe use.
In addition, entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. The FDA has promulgated specific requirements for drug cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly 


regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may issue enforcement letters or withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Corrective action could delay product distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities.
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of drugs previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an 

application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This type of application permits reliance for such approvals on literature or on an FDA finding of safety, effectiveness or both for an approved drug product. As such, under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA may rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for the new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
Our clinical program for troriluzole for the treatment of SCA and the treatment of OCD is based on a regulatory pathway under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA that allows reference to data on riluzole for the purpose of safety assessments.
Product Exclusivity - United States
In the United States, biopharmaceutical products are protected by patents with varying terms depending on the type of patent and the filing date. A significant portion of a product’s patent life, however, is lost during the time it takes an innovative company to develop and obtain regulatory approval of a new drug. As compensation at least in part for the lost patent term due to regulatory review periods, the innovator may, depending on a number of factors, apply to the government to restore lost patent term by extending the expiration date of one patent up to a maximum term of five years, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 14 years from the date of drug approval. A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the U.S. must submit a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the FDA. If the innovative pharmaceutical is a chemical product, the company files an NDA. If the medicine is a biological product, a Biologic License Application ("BLA") is filed. The type of application filed affects RDP exclusivity rights.
Small Molecule Products
A competitor seeking to launch a generic substitute of small molecule drug in the U.S. must file an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") with the FDA. In the ANDA, the generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic substitute and the approved NDA drug. The ANDA relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its NDA. An innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the FDA in what is commonly known as the FDA’s Orange Book. The FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after the innovator’s listed patents expire unless there is a successful patent challenge. However, after the 


innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA and allege that one or more of the patents listed in the Orange Book under an innovator’s NDA is either invalid or not infringed (a Paragraph IV certification). The innovator then must decide whether to file a patent infringement suit against the generic manufacturer. From time to time, ANDAs, including Paragraph IV certifications, could be filed with respect to certain of our products. 
In addition to patent protection, certain innovative pharmaceutical products can receive periods of regulatory exclusivity. An NDA that is designated as an orphan drug can receive seven years of exclusivity for the orphan indication. During this time period, neither NDAs nor ANDAs for the same drug product can be approved for the same orphan use. A company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical studies are conducted at the written request of the FDA to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients, and submission to the FDA is made prior to the loss of basic exclusivity. Medicines approved under an NDA can also receive several types of RDP. An innovative chemical pharmaceutical product is entitled to five years of RDP in the U.S., during which the FDA cannot approve generic substitutes. If an innovator’s patent is challenged, as described above, a generic manufacturer may file its ANDA after the fourth year of the five-year RDP period. A pharmaceutical drug product that contains an active ingredient that has been previously approved in an NDA, but is approved in a new formulation, but not for the drug itself, or for a new indication on the basis of new clinical studies, may receive three years of RDP for that formulation or indication.
Biologic products
The U.S. healthcare legislation enacted in 2010 created an approval pathway for biosimilar versions of innovative biological products that did not previously exist. Prior to that time, innovative biologics had essentially unlimited regulatory exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a “biosimilar” version of the innovator product. However, although an application for approval of a biosimilar version may be filed four years after approval of the innovator product, qualified innovative biological products will receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism for innovators to enforce the patents that protect innovative biological products and for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents. Such patent litigation may begin as early as four years after the innovative biological product is first approved by the FDA.

In the U.S., the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators’ intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators’ market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators’ basic patents covering major pharmaceutical products. Second, statutory and regulatory provisions in the U.S. limit the ability of an innovator company to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based solely on the expiration of the relevant patent(s) or the current forms of regulatory exclusivity.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and other geographies, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
European Union
A typical route used by innovator companies to obtain marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products in the EU is through the “centralized procedure.” A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of a Marketing Authorization Application ("MAA") with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the European Commission ("EC") and the EC then approves or denies the MAA. Regulatory approval via the centralized procedure results in a marketing authorization for the innovative pharmaceutical product in each EU member state. It is also possible for new chemical products to obtain marketing authorization in the EU through a “mutual recognition procedure,” in which an application is made to a single member state, and if the member state approves the pharmaceutical product under a national procedure, then the applicant may submit that approval to the mutual recognition procedure of some or all other member states. After obtaining marketing authorization approval, a company must obtain pricing and reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to 


member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete. Throughout the EU, all products for which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an “8+2+1” regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator. The possible extension to 11 years is available if the innovator, during the first eight years of the marketing authorization, obtains an additional indication that is of significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing treatments. For products that were filed prior to October/November 2005, there is a 10-year period of data protection under the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years under the mutual recognition procedure (depending on the member state). In contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant. In general, EU law treats chemically-synthesized drugs and biologically-derived drugs the same with respect to intellectual property and data protection. In addition to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has issued guidelines that outline the additional information to be provided for biosimilar products, also known as generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.
Japan
In Japan, medicines of new chemical entities are generally afforded eight years of data exclusivity for approved indications and dosage. Patents on pharmaceutical products are enforceable. Generic copies can receive regulatory approval after data exclusivity and patent expirations. As in the U.S., patents in Japan may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. In general, Japanese law treats chemically-synthesized and biologically-derived drugs the same with respect to intellectual property and market exclusivity. 
China
To obtain marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products in China, an NDA must be submitted to the National Medical Product Administration ("NMPA") once safety and efficacy has been established in Chinese patients. For imported 

drugs, this means issuance of an import license. The applicant must submit evidence of foreign approval (certificate of pharmaceutical product), unless it is an innovative drug that has never been approved anywhere in the world.
In China, medicines of new chemical entities are generally afforded 6 years of data exclusivity for approved indications and dosage. Generic copies can receive regulatory approval after data exclusivity and patent expirations. 
South Korea
To obtain marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products in South Korea, a marketing application must be submitted to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety ("MFDS"). The application must contain data in South Korean patients, information regarding safety and efficacy, quality, a good manufacturing practice certificate, and a certificate of pharmaceutical product in an approved country to show that the drug being imported is being sold in the approved country in accordance with the with the relevant rules and regulations in that country. 
In South Korea, medicines of new chemical entities are generally afforded 6 years of data exclusivity for first approved indications and dosage. Generic copies can receive regulatory approval after data exclusivity and patent expirations.
Rest of the World
In countries outside of the U.S., the EU, Japan, China and South Korea, there is a wide variety of legal systems with respect to intellectual property and market exclusivity of pharmaceuticals. Most other developed countries utilize systems similar to either the U.S. or the EU. Among developing countries, some have adopted patent laws and/or regulatory exclusivity laws, while others have not. Some developing countries have formally adopted laws in order to comply with World Trade Organization ("WTO") commitments, but have not taken steps to implement these laws in a meaningful way. Enforcement of WTO actions is a long process between governments, and there is no assurance of the outcome. 
Coverage, Reimbursement and Pricing
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, and private entities, such as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the 


payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. For example, the payor's reimbursement payment rate may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. However, one third-party payor's decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Further, some third-party payors may require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they provide reimbursement for use of such therapies.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product. These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. Thus, obtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is time-consuming and costly.
The U.S. and foreign governments regularly consider reform measures that affect health care coverage and costs. For example, the U.S. and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription products. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act ("collectively, the ACA") contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of products, including, for example, increased rebates for products sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical 

companies' share of sales to federal health care programs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") moved 41% of Medicare fee-for-service payments to alternative payment models ("APMs") tied to the quality or value of services by the end of 2018. HHS had set a goal of moving 50% of such Medicare payments into these alternative payment models by the end of 2018, but in 2019, it discontinued this performance goal and replaced it with a new developmental goal to increase the percentage of Medicare health care dollars tied to APMs incorporating downside risk, with a target of 40% for fiscal year 2021. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for our products.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the focus on cost containment measures, particularly in the United States, has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if we attain favorable coverage and reimbursement status for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
European Union Coverage Reimbursement and Pricing
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies, or so called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company.


Healthcare Laws and Regulations
Physicians, other healthcare providers, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors are and will be subject to various federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may impact, among other things, our arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare professionals who participate in our clinical research programs, healthcare professionals and others who purchase, recommend or prescribe our approved products, and our proposed sales, marketing, distribution, and education programs. The U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation, the following:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federally funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value;
•The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the federal civil monetary penalties law and the civil False Claims Act (which can be enforced by private citizens through qui tam actions), prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of federal funds, and knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
•The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") which imposes criminal liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;

•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 ("HITECH") and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without the appropriate authorization by entities subject to the law, such as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their respective business associates;
•The federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid ("CHIP") to report to HHS information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; and
•Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that impose similar restrictions and may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs, comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians and other health care providers; and state health information privacy and data breach notification laws, which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
We will be required to spend substantial time and money to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. Recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these federal and state healthcare laws. For example, the ACA amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes to clarify that liability under these statutes does not require a person or entity to have actual knowledge of the statutes or a specific intent to violate them. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is 


possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
Violations of these laws can subject us to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions including monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and reputational harm, we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. Moreover, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state laws and regulations, proposed and implemented, that could impact our future operations and business.
Healthcare Reform
The legislative landscape in the United States continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following:
•an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, which is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
•a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
•new requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and certain others, including reporting “transfers of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers and reporting investment interests;
•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;

•a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
•extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
•a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
•establishment of the Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"), to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. In January of 2021, an Executive Order entitled “Executive Order on Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act” repealed two previous Executive Orders delaying the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that amend all or part of the ACA.
In addition, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, as a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011, providers are subject to Medicare payment reductions of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments from providers from three to five years. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 also introduced a quality payment program under which certain individual Medicare providers will be subject to certain incentives or penalties based on new program quality standards. Payment adjustments for the Medicare quality payment program were scheduled to begin in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the quality payment 


program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program.
Further, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the costs of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States has also been the subject of considerable discussion. The previous U.S. presidential administration's budget for fiscal year 2020 contained further drug price control measures that could be enacted in other future legislation. Additionally, the previous administration released a "Blueprint" to lower drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs of drugs. HHS solicited feedback on some of these measures and, concurrently, implemented others under its existing authority. While a number of these and other proposed measures would require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.
 At the state level, legislatures are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.

Environmental, Social, Governance, and Human Capital
Governance and Leadership
Our commitment to integrating sustainability across our organization begins with our Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board has oversight of strategy and risk management related to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). Applying NYSE’s listing standards for independence, five of our seven directors are independent.
At the management level, we have implemented a cross-functional Sustainability Working Group, which is set to meet on a regular basis and report to the Board of Directors periodically. We also maintain a Chief Talent & Sustainability Officer position to work closely with the working group and coordinate efforts related to the advancement of ESG capabilities across the organization.
Business Ethics
We are committed to creating an environment where we are able to excel in our business while maintaining the highest standards of conduct and ethics. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code of Conduct”) reflects the business practices and principles of behavior that support this commitment, including our policies on bribery, corruption, conflicts of interest and our whistleblower program. We expect every director, officer, and employee to read, understand, and comply with the Code of Conduct and its application to the performance of his or her business responsibilities.
We encourage employees to come to us with observations and complaints, ensuring we understand the severity and frequency of an event in order to escalate and assess accordingly. Our Chief Compliance Officer strives to ensure accountability, objectivity, and compliance with our Code of Conduct. If a complaint is financial in nature, the Audit Committee Chair is notified concurrently, which triggers an investigation, action, and report. All incidents are reported up to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.
Environmental Commitment
We are committed to protecting the environment and attempt to mitigate any negative impact of our operations. We monitor resource use, improve efficiency, and at the same time reduce our emissions and waste.
In order to reduce the overall impact of our product on the environment, we have taken steps to enhance the sustainability of our manufacturing processes for our drug substances.
In collaboration with our contract research organization partners, we apply various green chemistry methodologies to our commercial and development pipeline. We have especially focused on using 


biocatalysis, a technology that makes use of enzymes instead of chemicals to accomplish specific chemical reactions used to construct organic small molecules such as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. 
We have also initiated work in removing hazardous organic solvents from certain reactions and replacing them with water. This green technology relies on the use of micelles to enable such reactions to occur in water where they would normally not occur due in part to the very poor solubility of most organic compounds in water. These greener processes not only create less waste, but the waste that is produced is much less hazardous, therefore reducing the environmental impact of the manufacturing process.
We are systematically addressing the environmental impacts of the buildings we own as we make improvements, including adding energy control systems and other energy efficiency measures. Waste in our own operation is minimized by our commitment to reduce both single-use plastics and operating paper-free, primarily in a digital environment. We have safety protocols in place for handling biohazardous waste in our labs, and we use third-party vendors for biohazardous waste and chemical disposal.
Social Responsibility
Our access to medicine strategy is simple: maximize access for all patients everywhere. In 2020, we not only met, but exceeded, our aggressive launch year target of 80% commercial lives access to medicine. We were able to reach 89% access across the board for commercial patients, which is a target we maintained throughout 2021. Our access within federally funded programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and VA/TRICARE also remains comprehensive. We have established drug donation programs for individuals who meet certain federal poverty standards. 
For third-party vendor selection and oversight, we have standard operating procedures that apply to employees and subcontractors who on our behalf, oversee and conduct research regulated by the FDA. We retain ultimate authority and responsibility for the conduct of regulated research, manufacturing, and testing and we must ensure that contracted services are conducted in accordance with Good Practice Guidelines and all applicable regulations.
Human Capital Management
At Biohaven, we foster and encourage a workplace environment that holds possibilities for everyone, with a commitment to respect and acceptance without biases. 
Development and continuous feedback are priorities for our organization, which comprises 928 employees as of December 31, 2021. We believe each individual person is critical to our success and we invest in our people by supporting continuous training programs and courses. We encourage each employee to engage with their manager in developmental 

discussions designed to focus on feedback rather than a rating.
An important part of our talent recruitment is our robust paid internship program for high school, college and graduate-level students. This program had over 50 participants in 2021 and offers opportunities to students in the community and develops a roadmap for ‘entry-level’ candidates. We evaluate the success of our recruitment program through metrics such as time to hire, offer acceptance rate, turnover rate and business results. Our voluntary turnover rate in 2021 was 4.7%, significantly under the industry average. Our low turnover rate demonstrates our commitment to our teams, the culture we are creating and our ability to retain our talent.
We strive to provide an inclusive workplace to foster growth and innovation. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Plan “Roadmap to Belonging” includes training to build DEI capabilities for all commercial employees, cultural competence capability building for leaders, as well as traditional anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training for all. Pulse surveys and individual interviews for commercial employees are conducted to assess program effectiveness. Combined with an agile mindset, this feedback enables our leadership team to further enhance program offerings to address the diverse needs of our team. We have expanded our team with an inclusive mindset from the beginning. We are actively focused on increasing the gender, racial/ethnic, and age diversity of our board composition and, over the past two years, we have made strides to diversify our senior leadership, with the number of females in scientific leadership positions becoming a strength of our organization.
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, we quickly established both an office-based and field-based response to protect our employees. We first and foremost encouraged all office-based employees to work from home and provided support for fully remote work. In our offices, we follow health and safety protocols by providing mandatory masks for anyone entering the building, foot-dispensing hand sanitizer stations, and disinfecting wipes at each workstation. We purchased high efficiency air filters to ensure air is not recirculated in the facilities. For our field-based teams we implemented virtual capabilities for meeting with healthcare providers, including the ability for physicians to verify, sign off, and receive Biohaven samples without putting our representatives at risk. We offer antibody testing and encourage employees to be tested for COVID-19 frequently.
