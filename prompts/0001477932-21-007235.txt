Industry Overview
 
The aerospace industry is proving that it can expand its traditional boundaries and meet today’s challenges with exciting new aircraft designs and business models. VTOL aircraft, which comprise a diverse array of small UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles or drones) and larger airframes for passenger and cargo transport, are a vibrant aviation niche market, attracting substantial investment and spurring technological innovation in virtually every aspect of aircraft development. The quintessence of contemporary aeronautical science and engineering, these mostly electric aircraft (eVTOL) are leading the green transformation in air travel. Given the current state of battery technology, however, larger eVTOL aircraft designs must be optimized for efficiency, which includes reducing engine energy consumption and structural weight where possible, often through utilizing advanced composite materials, additive manufacturing (3D printing) processes for some components, and the miniaturization of electronics. Duration, speed and payload capacity of eVTOL aircraft are dependent on the energy density and weight of batteries. The use of electric aircraft is also being considered for regional routes, flights generally under 500 miles between smaller regional airports. Hybrid electric and fuel cell systems may bridge the transition from petroleum-based fuels to fully electric power from batteries.
 
Multirotor UAVs have proven to be a viable, low-cost alternative in many applications previously dominated by the helicopter, including surveying, inspections, aerial photography and videography. In the future, larger eVTOL aircraft such as air taxis are poised to become a replacement for light helicopters for inter and intracity passenger travel and cargo delivery and possibly even for military transport. Among the advantages are clean emissions, better acoustics, less complex flight controls, autonomous capability, increased safety on the ground, superior maneuverability and reduced expenses related to maintenance, repair and operations. Because of the explosive growth of VTOL aircraft development over the past few years and their likely ubiquity in the future, new regulations are being formulated to allow their safe integration into civil airspace. As with UAVs, the flights of all new aircraft in civil airspace must also be regulated and safely integrated through some type of low-altitude traffic management system. Stakeholders shaping this integration process include aircraft manufacturers, ride-sharing companies, governmental regulatory agencies and civil transportation authorities, all of whom are working toward establishing standards and overcoming the multitude of issues involved with its implementation. Key technologies impacting the development and implementation of autonomous guidance, navigation and flight control systems, deemed the next technological revolution in air transportation, are high speed (5G) data transmission and AI.

Target companies will have disruptive technologies with applications in aerospace or innovative aircraft concepts with improved capabilities, efficiency, performance, sustainability, and safety. Categories of technology include a broad range of disciplines impacting areas such as structural design, aerodynamics, propulsion systems, advanced materials, autonomy, artificial intelligence (AI), sensors, communications, and navigation. Target companies also should have significant upside potential, unique I/P, roll up or combination potential, have a quality team in place to execute their business plan, and need funding for execution or growth, etc.
 
An emerging segment of the aviation industry attracting significant investment is the development of autonomous and semi-autonomous vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The quintessence of contemporary aeronautical science and engineering, these mostly electric or hybrid-electric aircraft include small remotely controlled UAVs as well as larger passenger and cargo UAVs, which are targeting the short-haul, on-demand transport of passengers and freight, called urban aerial mobility (UAM). The feasibility of these more lightweight and efficient aircraft designs is made possible through advancements in composite materials, additive manufacturing (3D printing), miniaturization of electronics, computer processing speed, battery power and electromagnetic propulsion. The UAV has become a viable, low-cost alternative in many VTOL applications previously dominated by the helicopter, including aerial photography and videography. Because of UAVs’ explosive growth over the past few years and their anticipated ubiquity in the future, new regulations are being formulated to allow their safe integration into low altitude civil airspace. Stakeholders shaping this integration process include aircraft manufacturers, ridesharing companies, governmental regulatory agencies, and civil transportation authorities, all of whom are working toward establishing standards and overcoming the variety of issues involved with its implementation. Key technologies impacting the development and implementation of this VTOL aircraft segment for fully autonomous applications include high speed (5G) data transmission and artificial intelligence. Also drawing interest is the development of VTOL and hover capable rotorcraft that can accomplish many of the civilian and military transport functions of a helicopter, but are faster, quieter, less complex to operate, and safer on the ground. Helicopters have served this mission for over 80 years and have improved significantly with advanced flight control systems but remain extremely complicated to fly and have performance limitations based on their fundamental flight principles. Due to a condition called retreating blade stall, also known as dissymmetry of lift, helicopters have a maximum forward speed of approximately 250 miles per hour. Additionally, helicopters produce high noise levels, due primarily to rotor blade vortex interaction and vibration, and have high operating costs. Most modernization in vertical lift aircraft design over the past few decades has been directed toward the modification of existing platforms. 
 
The UAV industry has experienced remarkable growth worldwide over the past decade, across the military, civilian governmental and commercial sectors. Industry forecasters view the booming UAV market as early-stage with significant potential, and as a result, expect the strong performance to extend well into the foreseeable future. A November 2018 market study by Teal Group Corporation, a leading U.S. aerospace and defense market analysis firm, predicts that UAVs will be the most dynamic growth sector of the global aerospace industry, more than tripling over the next decade. Critical factors driving the market’s continuing fast-paced surge include worldwide military adoption of UAVs, increased use of UAVs in commercial and civil government applications, ongoing high capital investments in UAV technologies, consolidation of UAV businesses through acquisitions and synergistic partnerships, and the changing regulatory environment for UAVs’ operation in manned airspace. The commercial sector is forecast to register the fastest compound annual growth rate (CAGR), outpacing both the military and civilian sectors; however, military spending will continue to be dominant, representing over 70 percent of all UAV industry revenue.

The U.S. is the world’s leader in the deployment and development of military UAVs, with some of the most sought-after systems in the world. A decade of extensive operational work with UAVs has given the U.S. military tremendous experience with the architecture, design, and deployment of UAV technology. Based on an assessment by Global Market Insights, the larger, higher value systems procured by the U.S. will drive the relative strength of the U.S. military market in the coming years. Military UAV manufacturing in the U.S. is led by General Atomics and Northrop Grumman with over 50 percent of the market. Spurred by new venture capital funding, UAV startups are continuing to enter the market while existing companies are consolidating, introducing new products and components, and shifting toward software and end-to end-solutions for niche markets to maintain market relevance. As UAVs become more widely deployed and accepted, regulatory agencies will need to begin identifying and tracking them as with other aircraft, ultimately bringing them into the air traffic networks. While there are 195 countries in the world, each at a different stage of UAV implementation, the UAV industry will likely be dominated by the largest economies, led by the U.S., China, Japan, Germany and the U.K. India will become the fastest growing commercial market for UAVs, having legalized their use in December 2018. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) market size was valued at $10.72 Bn in 2019 & is projected to reach $25.13 Bn by 2027, with a CAGR of 12.23%. Military activities represent the most significant market share, followed by the growth in the commercial sectors like the construction and agriculture industries, which require UAVs for mapping, inspections, surveying and maintenance. 
 
UAVs were originally developed by the military to provide aerial surveillance without risk to personnel and evolved into highly capable aircraft for deployment in a variety of missions, including combat, replacing more expensive aircraft. The foundational technologies pioneered and implemented in military UAV programs, as well as smartphone technology and other advancements within the past decade, have enabled UAVs to become powerful tools and a cost effective, reliable, and safer option in an expanding list of business applications across almost every industry. Among the areas experiencing dramatic improvements in recent years are electric propulsion, batteries, navigation systems, computer processing, camera systems, stabilization equipment, imaging sensors and analytics software. Many companies, realizing the value of UAVs, are incorporating them into their business processes, through purchasing complete hardware and software packages or through third party service providers. The growing commercial use of UAVs has led to the FAA and other agencies to begin formulating standards and regulations which will enable these aircraft to be identified by air traffic control and integrated into the National Airspace System. The benefits of UAV technology for commercial use will only be optimized, however, when both technological capabilities and regulations allow for fully autonomous operation beyond visual line of sight. Smart UAVs are the next big evolution in UAV technology, particularly with the arrival of 5G’s high-speed transmission across mobile networks. High-speed, secure wireless network connectivity, such as 5G, is required to safely expand UAV operations and unlock the true potential of UAVs in commercial applications. Latency, or transmission delay, is one of the technical issues which has limited fully autonomous deployment but can be almost completely overcome through 5G.
 
An application whose implementation will be dependent upon the development of autonomous enabling technologies is the use of UAVs in delivery services, or logistics. This application field is receiving significant attention and investment worldwide, and progress is being made on several fronts. According to analysts at Research and Markets, the market for delivery UAV services is projected to reach $29.06 billion by 2027. UAVs have the potential to change last-mile delivery economics for smaller and lighter packages as they could replace many deliveries currently made by traditional delivery vehicles. Since UAVs are not constrained by road infrastructure and congestion, they can theoretically deliver packages faster than a car/truck from a close-by storage location. UAVs can fly over difficult terrain, water or rural areas with poor infrastructure in many cases or take a much shorter route. Improving the speed of package delivery with lower cost of operation and environmentally friendly technology using unmanned aerial transport systems is currently an area of intense interest among major e-commerce and mass market retailers like Amazon and Walmart, tech giants like IBM and Google, and logistics companies like DHL and UPS. Even some fast-food restaurant chains like Domino’s are looking at the potential for food delivery using UAVs. Leading aircraft manufacturers, including Boeing, Airbus and Bell, are designing unmanned vehicles and systems for package and cargo transport and delivery, with several prototypes in the process of field testing. Over the past few years, thousands of patents and applications for patents relating to UAV package delivery systems have been granted and filed.

In addition to participating in the small UAV market, the Company is exploring larger, scaled-up aircraft, both manned or unmanned, and other potential applications in aviation. The prospective VTOL applications include short-haul on-demand or scheduled passenger or cargo transport, called urban aerial mobility (UAM). Urban aerial transport vehicles are designed for efficient, low-altitude, inter- and intra-city flights through electrically powered VTOL aircraft (eVTOL). UAM is receiving the attention of major aircraft manufacturers like Airbus, Bell and Boeing, and transportation services companies like Uber, with several prototypes already built. While the technology to develop, produce and fly these aircraft on a manned or semi-autonomous basis is available today, and a number of companies are well along in the process, like Lilium, Archer and Joby, the actual implementation will likely take many years due to lagging regulatory and infrastructure reforms. Most of the major issues related to regulations, airspace integration and infrastructure that will impact the rollout and penetration of these UAM systems are being addressed and seem to be moving in the right direction. Fully autonomous versions are dependent on real time data transmission, such as 5G technology, and would be even further out. Given the expected lag in federal regulations, integration policies and infrastructure, the Company believes that it has the opportunity to become one of the early players in the urban aerial mobility (UAM) market, which may include air taxi service, personal air travel, air ambulance and cargo transportation. Anticipating the materialization of this new market, well-established aircraft manufacturers and entrepreneurial entries, are in the process of designing and developing short and medium range VTOL-capable aerial vehicles for civilian on-demand and scheduled point-to-point urban transport. These companies are vying for the billions of dollars being invested into the space and want to be part of this emerging aviation segment, which is considered to represent the next frontier in commercial aviation. The convergence of several key trends has enabled the viability of lightweight VTOL aircraft as an option in urban transit, if only on a limited or niche basis. Morgan Stanley predicts Urban Air Mobility could have a total addressable market of $1tn by 2040 and $9tn by 2050
 
Another VTOL market that may be targeted is the more powerful long-range, heavy lift manned commercial or military transport aircraft, which is dominated by the helicopter. New aircraft designed for this market would be built for payload capacity, higher altitude and endurance, and would likely be powered by engines used for conventional manned aircraft with similar performance outcomes. There have been very few successful aircraft designs in this general category, particularly designs that have matched the capabilities of heavy lift helicopters, however the U.S. military’s adoption of the V-22 Osprey and V-280 Valor, as well as the AW609’s anticipated entry in civilian transport service, have renewed the interest in powered lift aircraft configurations. According to research firms ReportBuyer and GlobalData, the global helicopter market, which includes both military and commercial aircraft, was valued at $31.5 billion in 2017 and is projected to increase to $40.4 billion by 2027.
