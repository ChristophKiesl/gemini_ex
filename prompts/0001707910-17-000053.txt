ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
OVERVIEW

We were incorporated on July 31, 2015 in the State of Florida under the name La Veles Inc., that mostly remained inactive and on February 8, 2017, we filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Capax Inc. (Capax). Our offices are located at 7135 Collins Avenue, Suite 624, Miami Beach, FL 33141. Our fiscal year end is September 30. Our primary business is to set up a bakery-café chain. Our long-term objective is to franchise these bakery-cafes. We may also expand our operation to a few foreign nations in partnership with local investors and management in those nations and have begun discussions to do so, but so far have not made any formal agreements. We may also acquire currently operating small bakeries with an accompanying café with space to renovate according to our model.
Shell Company
 
We are a shell company as defined by Rule 405 of the Securities and Exchange Commission primarily because we currently have no or have nominal operations. As a result, an investment in the Company would likely to be an illiquid investment. An investor should consider the potential illiquidity of the Companys securities before investing in the Company.
OUR STRATEGY

Capax plans to lease and improve the leasehold to have a unique architecture to set up a chain of bakery cafes that we plan to franchise. According to the company web site of one of the founders of Panera bread, Ron Shaich, this methodology is how they began a small shop (that we plan to adopt) and grew up to a major public company:

1.
 See opportunity in long term consumer trends
 2.
 Align the concept with these trends
 3.
 Strong until level performance
 4.
 Significant unit growth
 5.
 Corporate performance

We believe the bakery café units built with an attractive architecture run by warm, friendly staff with a personal touch could compete aggressively and expand this version globally.

Our immediate goal is to establish our first bakery-café by leasing a location or by acquiring a currently operating bakery-café provided we can obtain audited financial statements for any such entity under the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) rules. We had meetings with two bakery-cafes in Miami, Florida to acquire them, after the required audits, to use as our first models to franchise. In the event we find these two bakery-cafes hard to audit due to irreconcilable records, then we may not pursue acquiring them but instead set up our new bakery-cafes in partnership with professionals in the industry. We met with a bakery owner and a master baker to buy his company and also to hire him to our Company to take charge of the operation. We also were introduced to a few expert bakers in France, had initial discussion over the phone as to them joining us and in the future, plan to meet with them to hire them as consultants. However we have not gotten any commitments from any of the people we have talked with so far. We made a trip to China and met with some investors to discuss expanding our planned franchise to China. We also visited some trendy shopping centers in China that we believe are ideal places to set up the first few bakery-cafes. However, we have not made any firm commitments or any agreements with the Chinese investors to move forward on these plans.

COMPETITION

The market for retail food stores comes from a variety of national, regional and locally-owned food service companies, including specialty food, casual dining and quick-service restaurants and restaurant retailers. The restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to location, customer service, price, value, food quality, ambiance, and overall customer experience. The bakery-cafes have competition from several segments of the restaurant business: breakfast, lunch, gathering place, dinner, take home, catering, delivery, and consumer packaged goods. Most these competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources than we do.

If we are unable to successfully compete in these markets, we may be unable to sustain our operation for too long.
