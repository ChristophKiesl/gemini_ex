 Our Business: Empowering People. Revolutionizing Engagement 
 We are dedicated to helping our clients realize exceptional customer engagement and achieve operational excellence. Our adaptive, cloud-architected applicationsbuilt on our unified Pega® Platformempower businesses with comprehensive visual tools to build, extend, and evolve applications to meet strategic business needs. 
 Products 
 We develop, market, license, and support software applications for marketing, sales, service, and operations, in addition to licensing our Pega Platform for clients that wish to build and extend their own applications. Our software is designed to assist clients in building, deploying, and evolving enterprise applications, creating an environment in which business and IT can collaborate to manage back-office operations, front office sales, marketing, and/or customer service needs. 
 Our applications are built on the Pega Platform, our unified platform. The Pega Platform uses a comprehensive set of visual models to build applications, including process models, predictive analytics, user experience (UX) designs, decision logic, and others. This visual, model-based approach is designed to be faster in building, deploying, and evolving applications than traditional programming, and to empower our clients to better engage their customers, simplify processes, and turn the power of change into a competitive advantage. 
 Our applications and platform intersect with and encompass several traditional software markets, including: Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Business Process Management (BPM), Business Rules Management Systems (BRMS), Dynamic Case Management (DCM), Decision Management, including Predictive and Adaptive analytics, and the Vertical Specific Software (VSS) market of industry solutions and packaged applications. 
 Services 
 Our Pega® Cloud Services provide Pega Platform environments that are provisioned, monitored, and maintained for individual clients to create and deploy Pega-based applications using an Internet-based infrastructure. We also provide consulting services and implementation support, training, and technical support services to help clients maximize our softwares business value. 
 Our clients include Global 3000 companies and government agencies that seek to manage complex enterprise systems and customer service issues with greater agility and cost-effectiveness. Our strategy is to sell a client a series of licenses, each focused on a specific purpose or area of operations, in support of longer term enterprise-wide digital transformation initiatives. 
 Our Products 
 The Pega Platform and applications help streamline business operations, connect enterprises to their customers in real-time across channels, and adapt to meet changing requirements. Our applications can be 
 
4 
 
 deployed on Pega-managed, partner-managed, or customer-managed cloud architectures, providing our clients with the flexibility to operate the software according to their own preferences. 
 


Pega Platform 
 The Pega Platform is a unified platform that enables clients to build enterprise applications in a fraction of the time it would take using traditional programming technologies. The Pega Platform is engineered to support complex, global enterprises, allowing for application development and deployment on a patented, layered architecture that supports reuse across lines of business, geographies, and customer segments. Our platform features a model-driven, code-free approach to application development that enables business and IT to collaborate, using a visual language that models the requirements and design of the application through readily understandable metaphors. This agile approach facilitates continuous improvement methodologies, such as Lean Six Sigma, to effectively manage individual projects or help drive a complete enterprise transformation. All aspects of the application are captured in the model, including business strategy mapping, business processes, data models, case definitions, rules, artificial intelligence (AI) constructs such as predictive and machine-learning analytics, decisions, reporting, interfaces, intelligent work management capabilities, business activity monitoring, and the UX across both web and mobile devices. Once defined this way, the finished application and documentation are generated and ready for use. 
 Our approach bypasses the error-prone and time-consuming process of manually translating requirements into code. The software application is created automatically and directly from the model, helping to close the costly gap between vision and execution. Changes to the code are made by changing the model, and application documentation is generated directly from the model. The Pega Platform is standards-based and can leverage a clients existing technology to create new business applications that cross technology silos and bridge front and back-office. The Pega Platform was previously marketed as Pega 7 or the Pega 7 platform, PegaRULES Process Commander, and the Build for Change® Platform. 
 Pega PlatformKey Technical Capabilities 
 The Pega Platform includes key technical capabilities that are available to Pegas CRM and operations applications. Our case management, business process, and robotic automation technology facilitates the fulfillment of customer requests. 
 Real-time decision management is incorporated into these applications to guide actions and optimize process outcomes based on business objectives. Our Pega® Next-Best-Action analytics leverage AI technologies that 
 
5 
 
 predict and adapt to customer behavior to improve both business outcomes and the customer experience. Capabilities for cross-sell/up-sell, retention, service recommendations, and collections can be changed with model-driven tools or intelligence, helping businesses deploy automated decision-making quickly. The predictive and adaptive analytics incorporated into these applications support the creation and refinement of decision models to improve outcomes. 
 Pega® Robotic Desktop Automation and Pega® Workforce Intelligence technologies are designed to allow our clients to optimize productivity by enabling their employees to work faster and more efficiently. These technologies are designed to simplify and automate business processes and transactions and provide insightful information into employee productivity for effective decision-making. 
 Social listening, text analytics, and natural language processing capabilities are also available in our Pega customer relationship management applications. These allow our clients to collect social content in tweets, blogs, and posts on Facebook or in other social communities, and enrich it by detecting language, topic, taxonomy, and sentiment. Using this capability, our clients are able to monitor, triage, and respond to social content across multiple channels, and turn it into actionable social intelligence. 
 Pega® Co-Browse collaboration technology enables users to provide fast service by simultaneously co-browsing web pages with their customers. The technology is designed to allow our clients to engage customers in real time, and can also be used to enable employees to collaborate across physical locations. 
 Pega® Mobility capabilities in our Pega Platform are designed to help clients efficiently build, manage, and deploy mobile applications as part of a unified omni-channel experience. By using Pega Mobility, enterprises can deploy Pega applications as packaged, branded mobile applications and manage the complex elements of the mobile application life cycle including security, integration, testing, and management of mobile applications and devices. Our mobile application development solutions are designed to help businesses to reduce the development time, deployment cost, and complexity associated with run-the-business mobile applications. 
 The Pega Platform also supports the creation of and interface with chatbots, virtual assistants, and other conversational user experiences, allowing our CRM applications to work across new interaction channels such as chatbots, Facebook Messenger, or Amazon Alexa. 
 Pega Applications 
 Pegasystems also offers purpose or industry-specific software applications built on the Pega Platform. These applications for marketing, sales automation, customer service, and operations provide business best practices tailored for specific industries. As they are built on the Pega Platform, these applications deliver flexibility beyond traditional, commercial, off the shelf products. We believe our applications allow our clients to offer differentiated service and value to their customers. The Pega Platform enables organizations to implement new processes quickly, refine customer experiences, bring new offerings to market, and provide customized or specialized processing to help meet the needs of different customers, departments, geographies, or regulatory requirements. 
Pega Customer Relationship Management Applications 
 Pega customer relationship management applications are designed to evolve to meet changing business needs. Our applications offer process-driven, customer-centric CRM software that maximizes the lifetime value of customers and helps reduce the costs of serving customers. We provide marketing, sales automation, and customer service applications to optimize marketing engagement, sales processes and customer service interactions. Our CRM applications work seamlessly together to ensure a consistent and unified customer experience.

Pega® Marketing applications enable enterprises to improve customer experiences across inbound and outbound channels. They incorporate AI in the form of predictive and machine-learning analytics, as well as business rules, and execute these decisions in real time to evaluate the context of each customer interaction, and dynamically recommend the most relevant action, offer, content, and channel. 
 Pega® Sales Automation applications automate and manage the entire sales process from prospecting to product fulfillment. Our software allows enterprises to capture best practices, and guides sales teams through the sales and customer onboarding processes. 
 Pega® Customer Service applications provide a contact center desktop, case management for customer service, mobile field service, digital, self-service, and industry specific processes and data models. They allow enterprises to deliver consistent interactions across channels, proactively address service needs, and improve employee productivity. 
Pega Operations Applications 
 Pega provides Operations Applications to support a variety of business needs including risk, fraud, and compliance management; exceptions and investigations; order fulfillment; claims processing; insurance underwriting; and product development. 
 Pega Cloud Services 
 Our Pega Cloud Services allow clients to develop, test, and deploy, on an accelerated basis, our applications and Pega Platform using a secure, flexible Internet-based infrastructure. Pega Cloud provides production, development, and testing (Dev/Test) services to accelerate the development and deployment of Pega applications and the Pega Platform. This allows our clients to minimize infrastructure cost while focusing on their core revenue generating competencies. 
 Additionally, the Pega Platform and Pega applications can be deployed on other cloud architectures, including customer- or partner-managed clouds. We believe this cloud-choice gives our customers the ability to select the best cloud architecture for the security, data access, speed-to-market, and budget requirements of each application they deploy. 
 Our Services and Support 
 We offer services and support through our Global Customer Success group, our Global Customer Support group, and our Pega® Academy training services group. We also utilize third party contractors to assist us in providing these services. 
 Global Customer Success 
 Our Global Customer Success group combines our sales and Pega consulting groups and provides guidance and implementation services to our clients and partners on how to best apply our technology and develop strong implementation expertise. 
Global Customer Support 
 Our Global Customer Support group is responsible for technical support of our products, including Pega Cloud. Support services include managing the online support community, proactive problem prevention through information and knowledge sharing, and problem tracking, prioritization, escalation, diagnosis, and resolution.

PegaAcademyTraining Services 
 The success of our sales strategy for multiple follow-on sales to target clients depends on our ability to train a large number of partners and clients to implement our technology. We offer instructor-led and online training for our staff, clients, and partners. Instructor-led training is offered at our regional training facilities in North America, the United Kingdom (the U.K.), Asia Pacific, and at third-party facilities in numerous other locations, including client sites. Online training is a convenient and cost-effective way to learn our software anytime, anywhere. We expect online training to continue to help expand the number of trained and certified experts globally. We have also partnered with universities to offer Pega courseware as part of the student curriculum, taught by Pega instructors and university professors to expand our ecosystem. Our courses are designed to meet the specific requirements of various project implementation roles to include both business and system architects, system administrators, and project leaders. 
 Our Partners 
 We collaborate with global systems integrators and technology consulting firms that provide consulting services to our clients. Strategic partnerships with technology consulting firms and systems integrators are important to our sales efforts because they influence buying decisions, help us to identify sales opportunities, and complement our software with their domain expertise and services capabilities. These partners may deliver strategic business planning, consulting, project management, and implementation services to our clients. Currently, our partners include well respected, major firms such as Accenture PLC, Atos SE, Capgemini SA, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, EY, Infosys Limited, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Tata Consultancy Services Limited, Tech Mahindra Limited, Virtusa Corporation, and Wipro Limited. 
Our Markets 
 Our target clients are industry-leading Global 3000 organizations that require applications to differentiate themselves in the markets they serve by increasing business agility, driving growth, improving productivity, attracting and retaining customers, and reducing risk. We deliver applications tailored to our clients specific industry needs. We also enable enterprise transformation initiatives by providing an application development platform that digitizes end-to-end processes and allows for multi-channel customer interactions, all enhanced by Pega Next-Best-Action analytics. 
 Our clients are in the financial services, healthcare, insurance, communications and media, public sector, manufacturing, and life sciences markets, as well as other industries. 
 Financial Services 
 Financial services organizations rely on software to market, onboard, cross-sell, retain, and service their customers as well as automate the operations that support these customer interactions. Our customer service, sales and new account onboarding, Know Your Customer (KYC), marketing, collections, and dispute management applications allow clients to be responsive to changing business requirements. 
Healthcare 
 Healthcare organizations seek software that integrates their front and back-offices and helps them deliver personalized care and customer service while reducing cost, automating processes, and increasing operational efficiency. Our applications allow healthcare clients to address sales, service, operations, financial, administrative, and coverage requirements of healthcare consumerism and reform. 
Insurance 
 Insurance companies, whether competing globally or nationally, need software to automate the key activities of distribution management, quoting, underwriting, claims, and policy servicing. Insurers are also 
 
8 
 
 becoming increasingly sensitive to ways to improve customer service and the overall customer experience. Our applications for insurance carriers are designed to help increase business value by delivering customer-focused experiences and personalized interactions that help drive higher sales, lower expense ratios, and mitigate risk. 
 Communications and Media 
 Communications and media organizations need to address high levels of customer churn, growing pressure to increase revenue, and an ability to respond quickly to changing market conditions. Our applications enable organizations to reshape the way they market and sell to customers, streamline onboarding and fulfillment operations, and bring new services and products to market. 
Public Sector 
 Government agencies need to modernize legacy systems and processes to meet the growing demands for improved constituent service, lower costs, reduced fraud and greater levels of transparency. Our applications deliver advanced capabilities to help streamline operations and optimize service delivery through an agile, omni-channel approach. 
Manufacturing 
 Manufacturers worldwide are transforming their businesses to better engage customers and suppliers, as well as to directly manage product performance throughout the product life-cycle. Our manufacturing applications address field service; help reduce supplier risk; manage warranties, recalls, repairs, and returns; and extend existing enterprise resource planning system capabilities. 
Life Sciences 
 Life sciences organizations are looking for solutions to improve customer engagement as well as increase efficiencies and transparency across the product development life-cycle. Our customer engagement, clinical, and pharmacovigilance applications are designed to deliver customer engagement, safety and risk management, and regulatory transparency. 
Other Industries 
 We offer software to a broad range of other types of companies and industries. For example, we sell our applications and platform to clients in travel, transportation, energy, retail, utilities, and other services. 
Competition 
 We compete in the CRM (which includes marketing, sales, and customer service), BPM, case management, decision management, robotic automation, co-browsing, social engagement, and mobile application development platform software markets, as well as in markets for the vertical applications we provide (e.g. Pega® KYC for Financial Services, Pega® Underwriting for Insurance). These markets are intensely competitive, rapidly changing, and highly fragmented, as current competitors expand their product offerings and new companies enter the market. We encounter competition from: 

 | BPM vendors, including service-oriented architecture middleware vendors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Case management vendors;
--+-------------------------


 | CRM application vendors;
--+-------------------------

 
9 
 

 | Decision management, data science and artificial intelligence vendors, as well as vendors of solutions that leverage decision making and data science in managing customer relationships and marketing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Robotic automation and workforce intelligence software providers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Companies that provide application specific software for the financial services, healthcare, insurance, and other specific markets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Mobile application platform vendors;
--+-------------------------------------

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Clients in-house information technology departments, which may seek to modify their existing systems or develop their own proprietary systems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer and include some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world, such as International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Salesforce.com, Oracle Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, and SAP SE. 
 We have been most successful competing for clients whose businesses are characterized by a high degree of change, complexity, or regulation. We believe that the principal competitive factors within our market include: 
 

 | Product adaptability, scalability, functionality, and performance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Proven success in delivering cost-savings and efficiency improvements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Proven success in enabling improved customer interactions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Ease-of-use for developers, business units, and end-users;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Timely development and introduction of new products and product enhancements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Establishment of a significant base of reference clients;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | Ability to integrate with other products and technologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Customer service and support;
--+------------------------------


 | Product price;
--+---------------


 | Vendor reputation; and
--+-----------------------


 | Relationships with systems integrators.
--+----------------------------------------

 We believe we are competitively differentiated as our unified Pega Platform is designed to allow both client business and IT staff, using a single, intuitive user interface, to build and evolve enterprise applications in a fraction of the time it would take with the types of disjointed architectures and tools offered by our competitors. In addition, our applications, built on the Pega Platform, provide the same level of flexibility and ability to adapt to our clients needs. We believe we compete favorably due to our expertise in our target industries and our long-standing client relationships. We believe we compete less favorably on the basis of some of these factors with respect to our larger competitors, many of which have greater sales, marketing, and financial resources, more extensive geographical presence, and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, we may be at a disadvantage with respect to our ability to provide expertise outside our target industries. See Risk FactorsThe market for our offerings is intensely and increasingly competitive, rapidly changing, and highly fragmented. in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Intellectual Property 
 We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secrets laws, as well as confidentiality and intellectual property agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have obtained patents relating to our system architecture and products in strategic global markets. We enter into confidentiality, intellectual property ownership, and license agreements with our employees, partners, clients, and other third parties and control access to and ownership of software, services, documentation, and other proprietary information as means to protect our proprietary rights. 
Sales and Marketing 
 We market our software and services primarily through a direct sales force. In addition, strategic partnerships with management consulting firms and major systems integrators are important to our sales efforts because they influence buying decisions, help us identify sales opportunities, and complement our software and services with their domain expertise and professional services capabilities. We also partner with technology providers and application developers. 
 To support our sales efforts, we conduct a broad range of marketing programs, including awareness advertising, client and industry-targeted solution campaigns, trade shows, including our PegaWorld® user conference, solution seminars and webinars, industry analyst and press relations, Web and digital marketing, community development, social media, and other direct and indirect marketing efforts. Our consulting staff, business partners, and other third parties also conduct joint and separate marketing campaigns that generate sales leads. 
Sales by Geography 
 Sales to clients based outside of the United States of America (U.S.) represented an average of 44% of our total revenue for the last three fiscal years. We have derived substantially all of our revenue from the sale and support of one group of similar products and services during each of the last three fiscal years. The majority of our long-lived assets were located within the U.S. at the end of each of the last three fiscal years. See Note 17, Geographic Information and Major Clients, included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Risk FactorsWe face risks from operations and clients based outside of the U.S. in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Research and Development 
 Our development organization is responsible for product architecture, core technology development, product testing, and quality assurance. Our product development priority is to continue expanding the capabilities of our technology. We intend to maintain and extend the support of our existing applications, and we may choose to invest in additional strategic applications which incorporate the latest business innovations. We also intend to maintain and extend the support of popular hardware platforms, operating systems, databases, and connectivity options to facilitate easy and rapid deployment in diverse information technology infrastructures. Our goal with all of our products is to enhance product capabilities, ease of implementation, long-term flexibility, and the ability to provide improved client service. 
 During 2016, 2015, and 2014, research and development expenses were approximately $145.5 million, $126.4 million, and $108.6 million, respectively. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. We expect that we will continue to commit significant resources to our product research and development in the future to maintain our leadership position. 
Employees 
 As of January 31, 2017, we had 3,908 employees worldwide, of which 1,675 were based in North America, 762 were based in Europe, and 1,471 were based in Asia Pacific. 
 
11 
 
Backlog of License, Maintenance, and Services 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had software license, maintenance, cloud, and services agreements with clients expected to result in future revenue (backlog) of approximately $707.8 million, of which we expect approximately $376.9 million to be recognized in 2017. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $580.9 million in backlog. Under some of these agreements, we must fulfill certain conditions prior to recognizing revenue, and there can be no assurance when, if ever, we will be able to satisfy all such conditions in each instance. Backlog may vary in any given period depending on the amount and timing of when arrangements are executed, as well as the mix between perpetual license, term license, and cloud arrangements. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion on license and cloud backlog, which excludes future revenue from maintenance and service arrangements, that management considers as one of the key performance factors.
