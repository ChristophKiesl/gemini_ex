------------+---------

 
Global Diversified Marketing Group Inc. (the “Company”) operates as a global multi-line consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) company with branded product lines and is a food and snack manufacturer, marketer and distributor through its subsidiary Global Diversified Holdings, Inc (“GDHI”) in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The Company operates in the snack market segment and offers Italian Wafers, French Madeleines, Coconut Wafer Bites, Italian Filled Croissants, shelf-stable Macarons, and other gourmet snacks. The Company sells its products directly through various distribution channels comprising specialty, grocery retailers, food service distributors, direct store delivery (“DSD”) as well as vending, pantry, and the micro-market segment. Company attends global food trade shows to seek out innovative and unique snacks products. Once the Company identifies products that fit within its distribution channels, company will enter into a non-exclusive manufacturing contract with a third party to produce products under the Company’s own trademarked brands for sale in the United States and/or global markets. Currently, the Company maintains five trademarks for its brands; each of which can and may cover numerous product lines with a variety of unique identifiers (known as SKU’s) offered under that brand name. The Company has non-contractual on-going relationships with many Fortune 500 companies including club and retail chain stores. The Company sells directly to these companies which purchase the items from the Company and distribute the items to their stores. The Company also sells and distributes to DSD distributors and food-service distributors which in turn service vending machine channels as well as micro-markets and coffee pantries.
 
The Company sells its products throughout the United States and global markets to buyers which typically represent recognized large retail chain stores. The products are then distributed by the chains to their local outlets. The Company seeks out and develops snacks and gourmet foods to brand under its trademarks based on management’s beliefs as to consumer demand. The Company works closely with buyers to evaluate products with the intent to identify products that have likely customer demand.
 
The Company intends to continue to seek to develop additional gourmet foods and snack products under its trademarked brands and to expand the Company’s offering portfolio by identifying, producing, and marketing new products. Management believes that the strategy of acquiring small regional brands and adding these to the Company’s national distribution can prove beneficial for the Company.
 
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China and other parts of the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a “pandemic”. The significant outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, and has adversely affected our business, results of operations and financial condition.  While we are unable to quantify the impact, we are aware that our restrictions on access to retail stores and other commercial activities has had an adverse effect on our results.
 
During 2020 we increased our revenue 26.1% above 2019 levels. We believe our revenue increase in 2020 would have been in excess of what we recorded had we not experienced the impact of Covid-19.
 
On January 27, 2021 we announced that we had successfully secured placement with a National Club Store Chain “Store Chain” for our premium snack to be stocked and sold in the Northeast Region. The initial order we received amounted to $282,880. We expect to receive additional orders although there can be no assurances.
 
Vending Operations
 
In addition to placing its products with large retail specialty chains, the Company supplies products to vending channels throughout the United States through food service distributors. These vending machines are located in malls, service stations, and schools. The Company works with vending companies that have, in the aggregate, more than 100,000 machines nationwide. The Company supplies vending companies with products. The Company works directly with some vending companies and with others through its food service distributors. The broker pre-sells the products and the distributor services the accounts. When the distributor services the accounts, the distributor buys the product directly Vending machine sales represent approximately 6% to 9% of our revenues.
Products and Trademarked Brands
 
The Company currently has five trademark brands. Each brand encompasses numerous SKUs that are brought to the market from time to time. The Company produces its products primarily on an “on request” basis from its retail chain buyers for sale through such chains.

Retail Chain Buyers
 
The primary distribution of the Company’s products is through specialty retail chains. The Company works with the buying office that determines placement for the Company’s products. The retail will then distribute the products to its retail outlets.
Marketing
 
Management believes that the Company’s products appeal to a wide range of consumers, including most age brackets. The young snackers, classified as those being between the ages of 18-34, tend to consume more snacks than average adults but the gourmet foods reach the broader adult market. The senior market tends to reduce snacks and gourmet foods.
 
The Company anticipates that its marketing strategy will use the internet and social media including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The Company’s distribution channels consist of retailers, distributors, online e-commerce, and vending companies. The Company’s marketing strategy is primarily targeted at the vendors and retail chain stores. The Company intends to utilize social media to create direct consumer interest in its products.
 
The Company anticipates utilizing the following opportunities to further their marketing program and to obtain information to adjust and modify, as needed, the marketing program.:
 
Networking. Networking is a low-cost but often effective means for the Company to generate partnerships and growth while bolstering personal commitments to the Company. Management will join wholesalers’ associations to network with other food manufacturers and distributors.
 
Trade Shows. The Company plans to attend trade shows and exhibitions related to the food manufacturing industry, such as SIAL, PLMA Amsterdam, Thaifex, Fancy Food, CIBUS, ISM, and ANUGA among others. Through attendance at conventions and trade shows, management remains knowledgeable and informed about advancements, trends, and issues of concern in the market.
 
Direct Sales. The Company plans to employ a dedicated sales team to enact precise sales and promotional efforts in the near future.
 
Social Media and Food Blogging. The Company will manage its brands on social media sites, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Twitter has proven an effective platform to conduct customer satisfaction surveys as well as solicit customer feedback on food products.
 
The rise in popularity of the food blogging community has given consumers a massive platform on which to share their opinion and make their voices heard. This has led to a rise in consumer concerns about food, with increasing emphasis being placed on healthy eating and organic produce. The Company will use food blogging websites to promote its products and highlight benefits that appeal to a new generation of socially-aware consumers.
 
Websites. A well-optimized website has been constructed, with proper site structure, page layout, and clear and easy navigation, along with targeted keywords embedded throughout the site to ensure prominent search engine placement and saturation. The Company’s websites www.360worldsnacks.com, www.biscottelli.com, www.gdmginc.com, www.dolcibono.com, www.fruttatasnacks.com are important marketing assets.
 
The Company anticipates that it will primarily target teens and adults up to age 65. The primary target market is “Young Snackers” that are 18-34 years old and tend to eat more snacks than other age groups. The trend of snacks between meals is especially strong with millennials and younger Americans. A quarter of American millennials, age 23 to 40, reported eating four or more times a day, compared to just 10% of Gen X and 9% of Baby Boomers. The Company believes that the senior age bracket (over 65) is not a strong snack market.
 
Competition
 
The snack food industry in the United States is very competitive, particularly in the savory and salty snack segment. In the United States, a study conducted by the Packaging Strategies reported that snacks account for 51% of all food sales, and 92% of adults in the US have snacked within the last 24 hours.
 
The Company has observed an increased demand for “healthy” snacks. In the United States, companies are finding success in the “snackable” fruit and vegetable category, such as grapes or baby carrots.
 
A challenge facing entrants in the snack and gourmet food market is the dominance of leading snack food producers, particularly the industry leader PepsiCo. Large producers may experience a high degree of brand and consumer loyalty and typically possess sufficient capital to invest in extensive advertising and promotions to obtain a greater market share. Furthermore, companies such as PepsiCo often benefit from higher profit margins when compared with small- to medium-sized operators, enabling them to lower their product prices and to engage in price-based competition with competitors. Multinational producers may also experience lower per-unit costs due to economies of scale and scope.
