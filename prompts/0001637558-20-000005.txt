ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
We are a master limited partnership formed on March 16, 2015 to manage and further develop all of our sponsor's active coal operations in Pennsylvania. All amounts discussed in this section are in thousands, except for per unit or per ton amounts, unless otherwise indicated.
At December 31, 2019, our assets are comprised of a 25% undivided interest in, and operational control over, the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, which consists of three underground mines and related infrastructure that produce high-British thermal unit (“Btu”) coal that is sold primarily to electric utilities in the eastern United States. We are a leading producer of high-Btu coal in the Northern Appalachian Basin and the eastern United States due to our ability to efficiently produce and deliver large volumes of high-quality coal at competitive prices, the strategic location of our mines, the industry experience of our management team and our relationship with CONSOL Energy.
The Pennsylvania Mining Complex, which includes the Bailey Mine, the Enlow Fork Mine and the Harvey Mine, has extensive high-quality coal reserves. We mine our reserves from the Pittsburgh Coal Seam, which is a large contiguous formation of high-Btu coal that is ideal for high-productivity, low-cost longwall operations. As of December 31, 2019, our portion of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex included 167,341 tons of recoverable coal reserves that are sufficient to support approximately 23.5 years of production. In addition, our reserves currently exhibit thermoplastic behavior suitable for cokemaking, which enables us, if market dynamics are favorable, to capture greater margins from selling our coal as a crossover product in the high-vol metallurgical market to cokemakers and steel manufacturers who utilize modern cokemaking technologies.

The design of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex is optimized to produce large quantities of coal on a cost-efficient basis. We are able to sustain high production volumes at comparatively low operating costs due to, among other things, our technologically advanced longwall mining systems, logistics infrastructure and safety. All of our mines utilize longwall mining, which is a highly automated underground mining technique that produces large volumes of coal at lower costs compared to other underground mining methods, with many of the approved permits as far out as ten years. We typically operate five longwalls and 15-17 continuous mining sections at the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. The current production capacity of our portion of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex’s five longwalls is 7.1 million tons of coal per year. The preparation plant is connected via conveyor belts to each of our mines and cleans and processes up to 8,200 raw tons of coal per hour. Our on-site logistics infrastructure at the preparation plant includes a dual-batch train loadout facility capable of loading up to 9,000 clean tons of coal per hour and 19.3 miles of track linked to separate Class I rail lines owned by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers’ transportation needs.
On July 1, 2015, our common units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. On July 7, 2015, the Partnership completed the issuance of common units in connection with the IPO, a private placement of common units with Greenlight Capital, and entered into a $400,000 senior secured revolving credit facility. In connection with the IPO, we acquired a 20% undivided interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses comprising the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. 
On September 30, 2016, we acquired an additional 5% undivided interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex for $21,500 in cash and the issuance of 3,956,496 Class A Preferred Units with a value of $67,300. All information (except distributable cash flow, which reflects the ownership percentage at the time) included within this filing has been recast to reflect the Partnership’s current 25% undivided interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses comprising the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. On October 2, 2017, all of the Class A Preferred Units were converted into common units on a one-for-one basis.
  Since November 28, 2017, CONSOL Energy has been our sponsor. CONSOL Energy's coal business includes its 75% undivided interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, terminal operations at the Port of Baltimore and undeveloped coal reserves located in the Northern Appalachian Basin, Central Appalachian Basin and Illinois Basin and certain related coal assets and liabilities. On August 16, 2019, all 11,611,067 subordinated units, which were owned entirely by our sponsor, were converted into common units on a one-for-one basis. As of December 31, 2019, CONSOL Energy holds (i) 16,811,818 of our common units, (ii) a 1.7% general partnership interest in us and (iii) all of our incentive distribution rights.
Our primary strategy for growing our business is to increase operating efficiencies to maximize realizations and make acquisitions that increase our distributable cash flow. The primary component of our growth strategy is based upon our expectation of future divestitures by CONSOL Energy to us of portions of its retained 75% undivided interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. 
  Our principal executive offices are located at 1000 CONSOL Energy Drive, Suite 100, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317-6506, and our telephone number is (724) 416-8300. Our website is located at www.ccrlp.com. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and does not constitute a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Organization Structure
The following simplified diagram depicts our organizational structure and our relationship with CONSOL Energy as of December 31, 2019:
Our Relationship with CONSOL Energy
One of our principal strengths is our relationship with our sponsor, CONSOL Energy. CONSOL Energy is a leading, low-cost producer of high-quality coal, headquartered in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. CONSOL Energy deploys an organic growth strategy focused on efficiently developing its resource base. CONSOL Energy’s premium coal grades are sold to electricity generators, steel makers, coke producers and industrial consumers, both domestically and internationally. CONSOL Energy is 
listed on the NYSE under the symbol “CEIX” and had a market capitalization of approximately $376.3 million as of December 31, 2019. 
Our Assets
CONSOL Thermal Holdings owns a 25% undivided interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. CONSOL Thermal Holdings entered into an operating agreement with CPCC and Conrhein under which CONSOL Thermal Holdings is named as operator and assumes management and control over the day-to-day operations of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex for the life of the mines. We are managed by the directors and executive officers of our general partner. As a result, the directors and executive officers of our general partner have the ultimate responsibility for managing and conducting all of our and our subsidiaries’ operations, including with respect to CONSOL Thermal Holdings’ rights and obligations under the operating agreement. Based on our current production capacity utilizing five longwall mining systems, our recoverable coal reserves are sufficient to support approximately 23.5 years of production.
Our Operations
Bailey Mine
The Bailey Mine is located in Enon, Pennsylvania. The Bailey Mine is the first mine developed at the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. As of December 31, 2019, the Partnership’s portion of the Bailey Mine’s assigned and accessible reserve base contained an aggregate of 28,817 tons of recoverable coal reserves with an average as-received gross heat content of approximately 12,890 Btus per pound and an approximate average lb SO2/mmBtu of 4.4. Construction of the slope and initial air shaft began in 1982. The slope development reached the coal seam at a depth of approximately 600 feet and, following development of the slope bottom, commercial coal production began in 1984. Longwall mining production commenced in 1985, and the second longwall was placed into operation in 1987. In 2010, a new slope and overland belt system was commissioned, which allowed a large percentage of the Bailey Mine to be sealed off. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our portion of the Bailey Mine produced 3,054 tons, 3,184 tons and 3,031 tons of coal, respectively. The Bailey Mine uses approximately six to seven continuous mining units to develop the mains and gate roads for its longwall panels. 
 Enlow Fork Mine
The Enlow Fork Mine is located directly north of the Bailey Mine. As of December 31, 2019, the Partnership’s portion of the Enlow Fork Mine’s assigned and accessible reserve base contained an aggregate of 81,126 tons of recoverable coal reserves with an average as-received gross heat content of approximately 12,940 Btus per pound and an approximate average lb SO2/mmBtu of 3.3. Initial underground development was started from the Bailey Mine while the Enlow Fork slope was being constructed. Once the slope bottom was developed and the slope belt became operational, seals were constructed to separate the two mines. Following development of the slope bottom, commercial coal production began in 1989. Longwall mining production commenced in 1991 with the second longwall coming online in 1992. In 2014, a new slope and overland belt system was commissioned and a substantial portion of the Enlow Fork Mine was sealed. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our portion of the Enlow Fork Mine produced 2,511 tons, 2,469 tons and 2,295 tons of coal, respectively. The Enlow Fork Mine uses approximately six to seven continuous mining units to develop the mains and gate roads for its longwall panels. 
Harvey Mine
The Harvey Mine is located directly east of the Bailey and Enlow Fork Mines. As of December 31, 2019, the Partnership’s portion of the Harvey Mine’s assigned and accessible reserve base contained an aggregate of 57,398 tons of recoverable coal reserves with an average as-received gross heat content of approximately 12,950 Btus per pound and an approximate average lb SO2/mmBtu of 3.8. Similar to the Enlow Fork Mine, the Harvey Mine was developed off of the Bailey Mine’s slope bottom. Once the slope for the Harvey Mine was placed into operation, seals were built to separate the two mines, and the original slope was dedicated solely to the Harvey Mine, which eliminated the need to make significant capital expenditures to develop, among other things, a new slope, air shaft and portal facility. Development of the Harvey Mine began in 2009, and construction of the supporting surface facilities commenced in 2011. Longwall mining production commenced in March 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our portion of the Harvey Mine produced 1,256 tons, 1,245 tons and 1,201 tons of coal, respectively. The Harvey Mine uses approximately three continuous mining units to develop the mains and gate roads for its longwall panels. The Harvey Mine’s existing infrastructure, including its bottom development, slope belt and material handling system, has the capacity to add one incremental permanent longwall mining system with additional mine development and capital investment.
Capital Expenditures
In 2020, the Partnership expects to invest $25,000-$30,000 in maintenance capital expenditures, which is decreased from 2019 levels due to expected reductions in equipment-related expenditures and spending on buildings and structures.
Our Customers and Contracts
We sell coal to an established customer base through opportunities as a result of strong business relationships or through a formalized bidding process. We refer to the contracts under which coal produced from the Pennsylvania Mining Complex is sold, which contracts are administered at our direction by a wholly owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy under a contract agency agreement, as “our contracts”. For 2020 and 2021, our contracted position, as of February 11, 2020, is at 95% and 43%, respectively, assuming an annual coal sales volume at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our contracted position includes a mix of sales to our top domestic customers and to the thermal and metallurgical export markets, maintaining our diversified market exposure and providing a solid revenue base for meeting our long-term market strategy.
The sales commitments under contract are our expected sales tons and can fluctuate up or down due to provisions contained within our contracts. The contractual time commitments for customers to nominate future purchase volumes under our contracts are typically sufficient to allow us to balance our sales commitments with prospective production capacity or incremental sales volume. In addition, the commitments can change because of reopener provisions contained in certain of these long-term contracts.  For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, approximately 88%, 68% and 68%, respectively, of all the coal produced from the Pennsylvania Mining Complex was sold under contracts with terms of one year or more.
The provisions of our contracts are the results of both bidding procedures and extensive negotiations with each customer. As a result, the provisions of our contracts vary significantly in many respects, including, among other factors, price adjustment features, price and contract reopener terms, force majeure provisions, coal qualities and quantities. Our contracts typically stipulate procedures for transportation of coal, quality control, sampling and weighing. Most contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal within stated ranges for specific coal characteristics such as heat, sulfur, ash, moisture, grindability, volatile matter content and other qualities. Failure to meet these specifications can result in economic penalties, rejection or suspension of shipments or termination of the contracts. Although the volume to be delivered pursuant to a long-term contract is stipulated, the customers often have the option to vary the volume within specified limits.
Substantially all of our multi-year sales contracts contain base prices, subject only to pre-established adjustment mechanisms based primarily on (i) variances in the quality characteristics of coal delivered to the customer beyond threshold quality characteristics specified in the applicable sales contract, (ii) the actual calorific value of coal delivered to the customer, and/or (iii) changes in electric power prices in the markets in which our customers operate, as adjusted for any factors set forth in the applicable contract. The electric power price-related adjustments, if any, result only in positive monthly adjustments to the contracted base price that we receive for our coal. Price reopener provisions are present in several of our multi-year sales contracts. These price reopener provisions may automatically set a new price prospectively based on prevailing market price or, in some instances, require the parties to agree on a new price, sometimes within a specified range of prices. In a limited number of agreements, failure of the parties to agree on a price under a price reopener provision can lead to termination of the contract.  Under some of our contracts, we have the right to match lower prices offered to our customers by other suppliers.  Some of the long-term contracts also permit the contract to be reopened for renegotiation of terms and conditions other than pricing terms, and where a mutually acceptable agreement on terms and conditions cannot be concluded, either party may have the option to terminate the contract.
Of our 2019 sales tons, approximately 66% were sold to U.S. electric generators, 33% were priced on export markets and 1% were sold to other domestic customers. Of the 33% of our 2019 sales tons priced on export markets, 6% were sold in the metallurgical market. In 2019, we derived greater than 70% of our total coal sales revenue from our top three customers. As of January 1, 2020, we had multiple sales agreements with these customers that expire at various times in 2020 through 2023.
Transportation Logistics and Infrastructure
We have developed a transportation and logistics network with dual rail transportation options that we believe provides us with operational and marketing flexibility, reduces the cost to deliver coal to our core market and allows us to realize higher free-on-board (“FOB”) mine prices. Most of our coal is sold FOB at the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, which means that our customers bear the transportation costs from the mining complex, and essentially all of our coal transported to our domestic customers or to an export terminal facility originates by rail. We believe our proximity to our core markets, dual rail transportation options, rail-to-barge access and customized on-site logistics infrastructure contribute to lower overall delivered costs for power plants in the eastern United States as a result of shorter transportation distances, access to diversified rail route 
options, higher rail car utilization, more efficient use of locomotive power and more predictable movement of product between mine and destination. In addition, we have favorable access to international coal markets through coal export terminals located on the U.S. east coast.
Seasonality
Our business has historically experienced limited variability in its results due to the effect of seasonal changes. Demand for coal-fired power can increase due to unusually hot or cold weather as power consumers use more air conditioning or heating, respectively. Conversely, mild weather can result in weaker demand for our coal. Adverse weather conditions, such as blizzards or floods, can impact our ability to transport coal over our overland conveyor systems and to transport our coal by rail.
Competition
The coal industry is highly competitive, with numerous producers selling into all markets that use coal. There are numerous large and small producers in all coal-producing basins of the United States, and we compete with many of these producers, including those who export coal abroad. Potential changes to international trade agreements, trade concessions and tariffs or other political and economic arrangements may benefit coal producers operating in countries other than the United States. We may be adversely impacted on the basis of price or other factors with companies that in the future may benefit from favorable foreign trade policies or other arrangements. In addition, coal is sold internationally in U.S. dollars and, as a result, general economic conditions in foreign markets and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may provide our foreign competitors with a competitive advantage. If our competitors’ currencies decline against the U.S. dollar or against our foreign customers’ local currencies, those competitors may be able to offer lower prices for coal to our customers. Furthermore, if the currencies of our overseas customers were to significantly decline in value in comparison to the U.S. dollar, those customers may seek decreased prices for the coal we sell to them. Consequently, currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.
The most important factors on which we compete are coal price, coal quality and characteristics, transportation costs and reliability of supply. Demand for coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our coal are closely linked to coal consumption patterns of the domestic electric generation industry and foreign coal consumers. These coal consumption patterns are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control, including demand for electricity, which is significantly dependent upon economic activity and summer and winter temperatures in the United States, government regulation, technological developments and the location, quality, price and availability of competing sources of fuel.
 Competition from natural gas-fired plants that are relatively more efficient, less expensive to construct and less difficult to permit than coal-fired plants has the most potential to displace a significant amount of coal-fired electric power generation in the near term, particularly from older, less efficient coal-fired power generators. Federal and state mandates for increased use of electricity derived from renewable energy sources could affect demand for our coal. Such mandates, combined with other incentives to use renewable energy sources, such as tax credits, could make alternative fuel sources more competitive with coal.
Laws and Regulations
Overview
Our coal mining operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety regulations. Regulations relating to our operations require us to obtain permits and other licenses; reclaim and restore our properties after mining operations have been completed; store, transport and dispose of materials used or generated by our operations; manage surface subsidence from underground mining; control water and air emissions; protect wetlands and endangered plant and wildlife; and to ensure employee health and safety. Furthermore, the electric power generation industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities, which could affect demand for our coal. 
Compliance with these laws has substantially increased the cost of coal mining, and the possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted, which would have a significant impact on our coal mining operations or our customers’ ability to use our coal and may require us or our customers to change their operations significantly or incur substantial costs. Additionally, these laws are subject to revision and may become increasingly stringent. The ultimate effect of implementation may not be predictable, as associated regulations may still be in development or subject to public notice, extensive comment, or judicial review.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations to which we and our customers’ business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations and financial position.
Environmental Laws
 Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect all aspects of coal mining operations, both directly and indirectly. The CAA directly impacts our coal mining operations through permitting and emission control requirements for the construction or modification of certain facilities. Indirectly, the CAA affects the U.S. coal industry by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal-fired electric power generating plants or other industrial facilities operated by our customers. 
Coal impurities are released into the air when coal is combusted. The CAA regulates specific emissions, such as sulfur, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, mercury and other substances. In addition to those statutes discussed herein, CAA programs such as Maximum Achievable Control Technology (“MACT”) emission limits for Hazardous Air Pollutants, the Regional Haze Program, and permitting requirements under New Source Review may directly or indirectly affect our operations. Such regulations restricting emissions from coal-fired electric generating plants or other industrial facilities could increase the costs to operate and affect demand for coal as a fuel source, therefore potentially affecting the volume of our sales. Moreover, additional environmental regulations increase the likelihood that existing coal-fired electric generating plants will be decommissioned or replaced with alternative sources of fuel and reduce the likelihood that new coal-fired plants will be built in the future. In recent years, repeal or revision to multiple regulations under the CAA has been proposed; however, the extent to which these regulations will take effect or survive future administrations is uncertain.
 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards Rule. In 2012, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) promulgated or finalized several rules for New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) for coal and oil-fired power plants. NSPS are technology-based standards that vary depending on the particular source, such as a coal-fired electric generating plant, and can have a significant influence on the cost of using coal as a fuel source. The EPA's 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule (“MATS Rule”) established NSPS for emissions of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (“SO2”) and nitrogen oxides (“NOX”) from coal-fired electric generating units (“EGUs”). The MATS Rule also established national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (“NESHAP”) for coal-fired electric generating units for certain impurities such as mercury. Unlike pollutants regulated by a NSPS, pollutants regulated by a NESHAP require the MACT be used to control emissions of the pollutant. The application of a MACT standard is generally more costly than other control technology standards, and prompted the closure of some facilities. The rule was challenged and ultimately rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 29, 2015 for failing to consider the costs imposed by the MATS Rule. The rule was remanded to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) to determine whether to allow the EPA to address the rule’s deficiencies or to vacate and nullify the rule. In April 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA's request to stay the case to allow the agency to fully review the rule. Nevertheless, many coal-fired electric power generators have already taken steps to comply with the MATS Rule, as such required control and operational modifications can take significant time to install and/or implement. On December 27, 2018, the EPA proposed to revise the 2016 supplemental cost finding for the MATS Rule, as well as the related risk and technology review required by the CAA. Under the proposal, the emissions standards and other requirements of the MATS Rule would remain in place while the EPA’s methodology for assessing the costs and benefits of the rule were being modified.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The CAA requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for six pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment (“Criteria Pollutants”). Areas that are not in compliance with these standards are considered “non-attainment areas.” In recent years, the EPA has adopted more stringent NAAQS for these Criteria Pollutants, which could directly or indirectly impact mining operations through the designation of new non-attainment areas which could prompt local changes to permitting or emissions control requirements, as prescribed by federally mandated state implementation plans that require emission source identification and emission reduction plans. Final rules may require significant investment in emissions control technologies by our customers in the electric power generation industry, and could affect the demand for our coal. For example, in 2015, the EPA finalized the NAAQS for ozone pollution and reduced the limit to 70 parts per billion (“ppb”) from the previous 75 ppb standard. The final rule was challenged in the D.C. Circuit. On April 7, 2017, the EPA advised the D.C. Circuit that it intended to reconsider the final rule and the Court subsequently stayed the litigation pending further action by the EPA. In August 2018, the EPA ultimately decided not to revisit the rule. As a result, the D.C. Circuit lifted its stay of the 2015 ozone NAAQS rule imposing the 70 ppb ambient air quality standard while EPA reviews the standards under an expedited process. On October 31, 2019, EPA published a draft policy assessment recommending that the 70 ppb ozone NAAQS be retained. The policy assessment will be followed by a proposed rule finalizing the ozone NAAQS update on or before October 1, 2020.
11

Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. On July 6, 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (“CSAPR”). CSAPR regulates cross-border emissions of criteria air pollutants such as SO2 and NOX particulate matter and ozone in the District of Columbia and 27 states. CSAPR requires states to limit emissions from sources that “contribute significantly” to noncompliance with air quality standards, such as electric power generating facilities. If the ambient levels of criteria air pollutants are above the thresholds set by the EPA, a region is considered to be in “nonattainment” for that pollutant and the EPA applies more stringent control standards for sources of air emissions located in the region. In October 2016, the EPA finalized revisions to the CSAPR, known as the CSAPR Update Rule. Following litigation in the D.C. Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court, CSAPR was implemented in two phases: Phase 1 began in 2015 and Phase 2 began in 2017. On December 6, 2018, the EPA issued the CSAPR “Close-Out” Rule, a final determination that the CSAPR achieves requirements with respect to the 2008 ground-level ozone NAAQS in 20 states, and accordingly, those states will not be required to impose requirements for further reduction in transported ozone pollution. In addition, the covered states do not need to submit state implementation plans (“SIPs”) that would establish additional requirements beyond the existing CSAPR update. The “Close-Out” rule was challenged by several states and other entities in the D.C. Circuit. In a September 13, 2019 ruling, the D.C. Circuit remanded the 2016 CSAPR Update Rule to EPA, finding that rule is inconsistent with the CAA. In a subsequent October 1, 2019 ruling, the CSAPR “Close-Out” rule was vacated.
Affordable Clean Energy Rule. In August 2018, the EPA published a proposed rule, the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, to replace the 2015 “Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants”, known as the Clean Power Plan (“CPP”). The CPP, which established separate NSPS for carbon dioxide (“CO2”) emissions for new, modified, or reconstructed power plants under the CAA, was challenged by multiple parties with its effective date ultimately being stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The EPA formally proposed repeal of the CPP on October 16, 2017. The CPP was formally repealed with promulgation of the final ACE rule on June 19, 2019. The ACE rule establishes greenhouse gas (“GHG”) guidelines for states to use when developing plans to limit CO2 emissions from coal-fired EGUs. The ACE rule provides that heat rate efficiency improvements are the Best System of Emission Reduction for coal-fired electric utility sources under the federal Clean Air Act. The ACE rule directs states to develop specific SIPs to implement the rule, and provides six heat rate improvement technologies that may be considered by the states to establish emission standards of performance on a plant-by-plant basis. States may also consider the remaining useful life of the EGUs, as provided by the CAA. While the ACE rule reduces regulatory burden on coal fired EGUs compared to the CPP, its ultimate effect on coal demand is unknown. Several states and public interest groups have petitioned for review of the ACE rule in the D.C. Circuit. The EPA has requested for an expedited review of the challenges, seeking a resolution in the D.C. Circuit in 2020.
 National Environmental Policy Act. The National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to taking a “major Federal action”, which encompasses agencies’ decisions on certain permitting applications that fall under federal jurisdiction. NEPA reviews require federal agencies to review the environmental impacts of their decisions, including those associated with GHG emissions and the effects of climate change. Agencies must issue either an Environmental Impact Statement or an Environmental Assessment, which may create delays in project review and authorization timeframes, or increase the cost of compliance. In June 2018, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on NEPA seeking to streamline the NEPA process, while also minimizing unnecessary litigation, cost and delay for project proponents. On June 26, 2019, CEQ published a “Draft NEPA Guidance on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions” to replace guidance previously issued in 2016. The draft guidance seeks to clarify the scope of review federal agencies should undertake when considering the effects of GHG emissions under NEPA. A final proposed rule is expected to be published in 2020. Certain federal courts have held that GHGs must be considered under NEPA prior to a federal agency taking a “major Federal action,” and any modifications to NEPA will likely be subject to legal challenge.
Laws and Regulations Governing Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Our customers' consumption of the coal we produce results in the emission of GHGs, such as CO2 and nitrous oxide. During operations, our coal mines release methane, a GHG, to promote a safe working environment for our miners underground. GHGs are believed to contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. As a result, global climate change initiatives and regulations intended to reduce GHG emissions have and are expected to continue to result in (i) the decreased utilization or accelerated closure of existing coal-fired EGUs, (ii) the increased utilization of alternative fuels or generating systems, and (iii) a reduction or elimination of new coal-fired power plant construction in certain countries. 
Foreign governments, including the European Union and member countries, have adopted regulations governing GHG emissions. In the United States, findings published by the EPA in 2009 concluded that GHG emissions pose an endangerment to public health and the environment. These findings provided the EPA with the authority to adopt and implement regulations restricting GHG emissions under existing provisions of the CAA. For example, the EPA relied on this authority to promulgate NSPS for CO2 emissions from power plants under the ACE rule, discussed above. 
12

Since 2011, the EPA has required underground coal mines and certain support facilities exceeding a minimum GHG emission threshold to report emissions annually under the Mandatory Reporting Rule. These emissions are currently classified as fugitive emissions associated with coal extraction and are not currently regulated by the EPA. Previous petitions and judicial challenges seeking to compel the EPA to classify coal mines as stationary sources appropriate for regulation have been unsuccessful to date. If the EPA were to regulate coal mine methane emissions in the future, we would likely be required to install additional pollution control devices, pay fees or taxes for our emissions, or incur expenses associated with the purchase of emissions credits, in order to continue operation. Alternatively, we may need to curtail coal production. The magnitude of impact on our operations, capital expenditures, financial condition or cash flows would be dependent on the structure of any proposed regulation and the degree of emission reduction prescribed. 
In the absence of sweeping federal legislation on GHG emissions in the United States, some states, governors, mayors and businesses have committed to the goals of the Paris Agreement or other broad GHG reduction initiatives. For instance, on October 3, 2019, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf issued an Executive Order, “Commonwealth Leadership in Addressing Climate Change through Electric Sector Emissions Reductions,” directing the state’s Department of Environmental Protection to begin a rulemaking process that will allow Pennsylvania to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”). RGGI is a mandatory cap-and- trade program among 10 northeastern states to reduce CO2 emissions from the power sector. Governor Wolf’s authority to commit the state to membership in such a consortium without the approval of lawmakers will likely be subject to legislative and legal challenges, and its ultimate effect on coal demand is presently unknown. Similar to other mandatory cap-and-trade initiatives, such as the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord and the Western Climate Initiative, RGGI seeks to limit CO2 emissions annually in order to achieve a prescribed long-term emissions reduction target. In all cap-and-trade scenarios, power generators are required to purchase allowances, available through auction or a secondary market, that are equal to one ton of CO2 emissions thereby increasing the cost of electric power generation. GHG and climate change initiatives, associated regulation, and cap-and-trade initiatives could result in decreased demand and decreased prices for our coal, in both domestic and international markets.

Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and corresponding state laws affect our coal operations by regulating discharges into certain waters, primarily through permitting. CWA permits issued either by the EPA or an analogous state agency typically require regular monitoring and compliance with limitations on defined pollutants and reporting requirements. Specific to the Partnership's operations, CWA permits and corresponding state laws often require (1) treatment of discharges from coal mining properties for non-traditional pollutants, such as chlorides, sulfates, selenium and dissolved solids and (2) requirements to dispose of produced wastes at approved disposal facilities. 
In order to obtain a permit for certain coal mining activities, including the construction of coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments that may result in impacts to waters of the United States, an operator may need to obtain a permit for the discharge of fill material from the Army Corps of Engineers (“ACOE”) under Section 404, as well as a corresponding permit from the state regulatory authority under Section 401 of the CWA. Alternatively, for specific categories of activities determined to have minimal effects, the Partnership may be required to obtain nationwide permits from the ACOE. All permits associated with the placement of dredge or fill material subject to minimum thresholds require appropriate mitigation. Permit holders must receive explicit authorization from ACOE before proceeding with mining activities, which could result in time or cost burdens to our operations. 
Additionally, the Partnership must obtain National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permits from the appropriate state or federal permitting authority under Section 402 of the CWA. These permits establish effluent limitations for discharges to streams that are protective of water quality standards. For wastewater discharges to receiving waters that are classified as either high-quality or impaired, stringent restrictions are established to ensure anti-degradation and compliance with water quality standards. Permitting such discharges under NPDES could increase the cost, time, and difficulty of complying with permit requirements, and may warrant costly treatment that could affect our operations. 
Under the CWA, citizens may sue permit holders for alleged discharges of pollutants not explicitly limited by NPDES permits, or, citizens may sue to enforce NPDES permit requirements. Beginning in 2012, multiple citizen suits have been filed alleging violations of numeric and narrative water quality standards that broadly prohibit effects to aquatic life. The suits seek penalties and injunctive relief that could limit future discharges or impose expensive treatment technologies. While the outcome of these suits cannot be predicted, court rulings could result in additional treatment expenses that could affect our operations. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” regarding certain actions pertaining to our operations.
 In June 2015, the EPA issued a rule to clarify which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction under the CWA, known as the Clean Water Rule. This rule was quickly challenged and nationwide implementation was blocked by a federal appeals court. The Clean Water Rule would impose additional permitting obligations on the Partnership's operations by increasing the 
number of waterbodies subject to CWA permitting and other regulations. On February 28, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order prompting the EPA and ACOE to consider replacing the blocked Clean Water Rule. On December 11, 2018, the EPA and the ACOE proposed a new regulation to determine which waterbodies are subject to federal jurisdiction. A final rule repealing the 2015 definition of “Waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) became effective on December 23, 2019. The repeal resets a consistent, nationwide regulatory standard to the previous pre-2015 regulations. A replacement rule that redefines WOTUS to comport with the text of the CWA is expected to be finalized in 2020.
On November 3, 2015, the EPA published the final Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards (“ELG”) rule, revising the regulations for the Steam Electric Power Generating category which became effective on January 4, 2016. The rule sets the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants. On September 13, 2017, the EPA finalized a rule postponing for two years certain applicability dates for specific waste streams subject to the effluent limitations. On November 22, 2019, the EPA published its proposed revisions to the stringent limitations and standards included in the 2015 final ELG rule, while establishing a voluntary incentive program which provides power plants until December 31, 2028, to implement changes. 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (“SMCRA”) establishes minimum extraction, environmental, reclamation, and closure standards for mining activities. While SMCRA is a comprehensive statute, it does not supersede other major statutes such as the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act and other statutes discussed herein. Operators must obtain SMCRA permits and permit renewals from the U.S. Office of Surface Mining (“OSM”) or from the applicable state agency where states have been granted regulatory primacy by demonstrating that the state’s regulatory program is at least as stringent as the federal program. Our active operations are located in states which have achieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of SMCRA, with oversight from OSM. The timing of permit issuance is largely at the discretion of the regulatory authorities and is related to the size and complexity of the operation seeking approval. Timing of permit issuance can also be influenced by public engagement in the permitting process, such as through comment, hearings, or legal interventions which could affect our operations. In addition, mining permits can be delayed, refused, or revoked if any entity under common ownership or control have unabated permit violations, including the mining and compliance history of officers, directors, and principal owners of the entity seeking permit approval. 
Under federal and state laws, including SMCRA, we are required to obtain surety bonds or other acceptable security to secure payment of our long-term obligations, including mine closure and reclamation, mine water treatment, federal and state workers’ compensation costs, coal leases, or other miscellaneous obligations. Surety bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis and it is possible that surety-bond issuers may refuse to renew bonds or may demand additional collateral therefor. In recent years, surety bond costs have increased, the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable, and the number of companies willing to issue surety bonds has decreased. Any failure to maintain, or our inability to acquire, surety bonds required by state and federal laws or the related collateral required by bond issuers, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. As of December 31, 2019, we posted an aggregated $89 million in surety bonds for reclamation purposes, as well as approximately $11 million in surety bonds, cash, and letters of credit to secure other obligations including workers compensation, coal lease, and other obligations. 
In addition, SMCRA imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are deposited in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, which is used to restore lands mined, closed, or abandoned before SMCRA's adoption in 1977, and to pay health care benefit costs of orphan beneficiaries of the Combined Fund created by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992. The current per ton fee is $0.12 per ton for underground mined coal. This fee is currently scheduled to be in effect until September 30, 2021. We recognized expense related to Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund fees of approximately $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
 Endangered Species Act. The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and other related federal and state statutes protect species that have been classified as endangered or threatened with possible extinction, or other protective designations. Protection of these species could prohibit or delay authorization of mining activities or may place additional restrictions on our operations related to timbering, construction, vegetation, or water discharges. A number of species indigenous to our operating areas are protected under the ESA or other related laws and regulations; however, we do not believe the ESA would materially or adversely affect our mining operations under current approved mining plans. If more stringent or protective measures were required, or if additional critical habitat areas were designated, our operations could be exposed to additional requirements and expense, or delayed approval timeframes. In August 2018, the Department of the Interior issued three proposed rules intended to update and streamline the ESA as it relates to: (i) factors for the listing, delisting, or reclassifying of species, and the designation of critical habitat and (ii) the blanket extension of prohibitions for endangered species to threatened species. These rules, which became effective on September 26, 2019, are subject to challenge from several states and environmental groups.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) imposes remediation requirements related to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under CERCLA or related state laws, joint and several liability may be imposed on generators of hazardous waste, site owners, waste transporters or others regardless of fault associated with the original disposal activity. Although the EPA excludes most wastes generated during coal mining and processing from hazardous waste laws, such wastes may contain hazardous substances that are governed by CERCLA if released to the environment. Our current operations, operations of our predecessors, or sites to which we have sent waste materials could be subject to liability under CERCLA. 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and corresponding state laws and regulations affect coal mining by imposing requirements for the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal of certain wastes created throughout the coal mining process. Facilities where certain regulated wastes have been treated, stored or disposed of are subject to RCRA and may receive corrective action orders for instances of non-compliance or in the event a hazardous substance is released to the environment. Many waste streams created throughout the mining process are excluded from the regulatory definition of hazardous waste, and coal operations authorized under SMCRA are exempt from RCRA permitting requirements. RCRA is particularly important in the coal industry because it regulates coal combustion residuals - byproducts of coal combustion. In April 2015, the EPA published regulations under RCRA for the disposal of coal combustion residuals from electric utilities and independent power producers (the “coal combustion residuals rule”). Importantly, coal combustion residuals are regulated under RCRA as “non-hazardous” waste and avoid the stricter, costlier regulations under RCRA's “hazardous” waste rules. In 2018, the EPA promulgated the first of a two-part rulemaking amending the national minimum criteria for existing and new coal combustion residuals impoundments. The EPA released its second rulemaking proposal on December 19, 2019, to establish a federal permitting program for states and territories that do not have an approved permitting program for the disposal of coal combustion residuals in surface impoundments and landfills under RCRA. The coal combustion residuals rule imposes new requirements at existing coal combustion residuals impoundments and landfills that would generally increase the cost of coal combustion residuals management. The combined effect of the coal combustion residuals rule and ELG regulations (discussed above) has compelled power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and may force the closure of certain older existing coal burning power plants that cannot comply with the new standards. Such retirements may adversely affect the demand for our coal.
 Other Environmental Regulations. We are required to comply with other state, federal and local environmental laws in addition to those discussed above. These laws include, for example, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, the Toxic Release Inventory, and the rules governing the use and storage of explosives regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and the Department of Homeland Security.
Health and Safety Laws
Mine Safety. Legislative and regulatory changes have required us to purchase additional safety equipment, construct stronger seals to isolate mined out areas, and engage in additional training. We have also experienced more aggressive inspection protocols, and with new regulations, the volume of civil penalties have increased. The actions taken thus far by federal and state governments include requiring:

• | the caching of additional supplies of self-contained self-rescuer devices underground;


• | the purchase and installation of electronic communication and personal tracking devices underground;


• | the purchase and installation of proximity detection devices on continuous miner machines;


• | the placement of refuge chambers, which are structures designed to provide refuge for groups of miners during a mine emergency when evacuation from the mine is not possible, which will provide breathable air for 96 hours;


• | the purchase of new fire resistant conveyor belting underground;


• | additional training and testing that creates the need to hire additional employees;


• | more stringent rock dusting requirements; and


• | the purchase of personal dust monitors for collecting respirable dust samples from certain miners.

On September 2, 2015, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) published proposed rules for underground coal mining operations concerning proximity detection systems for coal hauling machines and scoops. The rulemaking record for this proposed rule was closed on December 15, 2016, but on January 9, 2017, MSHA published a notice reopening the record and extending the comment period for this proposed rule for 30 days. MSHA has not issued a final rule regarding these proposed rules.
Since March 2015, all underground coal mine operations have been required by MSHA to equip continuous mining machines (except full-face continuous mining machines) with proximity detection systems. The proximity detection system 
strengthens protection for miners by reducing the potential of pinning, crushing and striking hazards that result in life-threatening injuries and death.
Since August 1, 2014, we have been subject to additional rules designed to lower miners’ exposure to respirable coal mine dust. Accordingly, we have been required to take full shift dust samples from the designated occupations and areas using the new continuous personal dust monitor (“CPDM”) technology, which provides real time dust exposure information to the miner. CPDM equipment was purchased and was placed into service which was required to meet compliance with the new rule. Dust Coordinators and Dust Technicians were hired in order to meet the staffing demand to manage compliance with the new rule. The current respirable dust standard was reduced from 2.0 to 1.5mg/m3 for designated occupations and from 1.0 to 0.5mg/m3 for Part 90 miners (coal miners who show evidence of the development of black lung disease).
Black Lung Legislation. Under federal black lung benefits legislation, each coal mine operator is required to make payments of black lung benefits or contributions to: 

• | current and former coal miners totally disabled from black lung disease;


• | certain survivors of miners who have died from black lung disease; and


• | a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants whose last mine employment was before January 1, 1970, where no responsible coal mine operator has been identified for claims (where a miner’s last coal employment was after December 31, 1969), or where the responsible coal mine operator has defaulted on the payment of such benefits. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on U.S. production of coal, at a 2018 rate of up to $1.10 per ton for deep mined coal and up to $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, neither amount to exceed 4.4% of the gross sales price. On January 1, 2019, the excise tax levels reverted to pre-2008 levels, at $0.50 per ton for deep mined coal and $0.25 per ton for surface-mined coal. In December 2019, Congress restored the 2018 rates (of up to $1.10 per ton for deep mined coal and up to $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal), effective through December 31, 2020.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act made two changes to the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. First, it provided changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims by creating a legal presumption that miners are entitled to benefits if they have worked at least 15 years in underground coal mines, or in similar conditions, and suffer from a totally disabling lung disease. To rebut this presumption, a coal company would have to prove that a miner did not have black lung or that the disease was not caused by the miner’s work. Second, it changed the law so that black lung benefits will continue to be paid to dependent survivors when the miner passes away, regardless of the cause of the miner’s death. The changes have increased the cost to us of complying with the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. In addition to the federal legislation, we are also liable under various state statutes for our portion of black lung claims.
Other State and Local Laws
  Ownership of Coal Rights. The Partnership’s coal business acquires ownership or leasehold rights to coal properties prior to conducting operations on those properties. As is customary in the coal industry, we have generally conducted only a summary review of the title to coal rights that are not in our development plans, but which we believe we control. This summary review is conducted at the time of acquisition or as part of a review of our land records to determine control of coal rights. Given our experience as a coal producer, we believe we have a well-developed ownership position relating to our coal control. Prior to the commencement of development operations on coal properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. We generally will not commence operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. We are typically responsible for the cost of curing any title defects. We have completed title work on substantially all of our coal-producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry.
Employees
Neither we nor our subsidiaries have any employees. Our general partner has the sole responsibility for procuring the employees and other personnel necessary to conduct our operations. The directors and executive officers of our general partner manage our and our subsidiaries’ operations and activities. The executive officers of our general partner are employed and compensated by CONSOL Energy or its affiliates, other than the general partner. Under our omnibus agreement, we reimburse CONSOL Energy for compensation-related expenses (including salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts) attributable to the portion of an executive’s compensation that is allocable to our general partner. Pursuant to the operating agreement, CONSOL Thermal Holdings, our wholly owned subsidiary, manages and controls the day-to-day operations of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. Under our employee services agreement, employees of CONSOL Energy and its subsidiaries continue to mine, process and market coal from the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, subject to our direction and control under the operating agreement. All of the field-level employees required to conduct and support our operations are employed by 
CONSOL Energy or its subsidiaries and are subject to the employee services agreement. As of December 31, 2019, CONSOL Energy employed approximately 1,594 people, who provide direct support to our operations pursuant to the employee services agreement. None of the employees who provide direct support to the Pennsylvania Mining Complex are represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement. 
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”), for as long as the Partnership remains an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from the SEC’s reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking unitholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.
The Partnership will remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2020, although we will lose that status sooner if:

• | we have more than $1.07 billion of revenues in a fiscal year;


• | our limited partner interests held by non-affiliates have a market value of more than $700 million; or


• | we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.

The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Partnership has irrevocably elected to “opt out” of this exemption and, therefore, is subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
Additionally, under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, the Partnership also qualifies as a “smaller reporting company” because its public float as of the last business day of the Partnership’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter was less than $250 million. For as long as the Partnership remains a “smaller reporting company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from the SEC’s reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies that are not smaller reporting companies.
