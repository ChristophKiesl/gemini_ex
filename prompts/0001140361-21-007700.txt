ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
Lincoln Educational Services Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”, “we”, “our” and “us”, as applicable) provide diversified career-oriented post-secondary education to recent high school graduates and working adults.  The Company, which currently operates 22 campuses in 14 states, offers programs in automotive technology, skilled trades (which include HVAC, welding and computerized numerical control and electrical and electronic systems technology, among other programs), healthcare services (which include nursing, dental assistant and medical administrative assistant, among other programs), hospitality services (which include culinary, therapeutic massage, cosmetology and aesthetics) and information technology (which consists of information technology programs).  The schools operate under Lincoln Technical Institute, Lincoln College of Technology, Lincoln Culinary Institute, and Euphoria Institute of Beauty Arts and Sciences and associated brand names.  Most of the campuses serve major metropolitan markets and each typically offers courses in multiple areas of study.  Five of the campuses are destination schools, which attract students from across the United States and, in some cases, from abroad. The Company’s other campuses primarily attract students from their local communities and surrounding areas.  All of the campuses are nationally or regionally accredited and are eligible to participate in federal financial aid programs by the U.S. Department of Education (the “DOE”) and applicable state education agencies and accrediting commissions which allow students to apply for and access federal student loans as well as other forms of financial aid. The Company was incorporated in New Jersey in 2003 as the successor-in-interest to various acquired schools including Lincoln Technical Institute, Inc. which opened its first campus in Newark, New Jersey in 1946. 
 
Our business is organized into three reportable business segments: (a) Transportation and Skilled Trades, (b) Healthcare and Other Professions, or “HOPS”, and (c) Transitional, which refers to campus operations that have been closed.  As of December 31, 2020, we had 12,217 students enrolled at 22 campuses which excludes 102 students on leave of absence due to the coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”).  Our average enrollment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 11,729 students which represented an increase of 6.8% from average enrollment in 2019 which excludes 375 average enrollments on leave of absence due to COVID-19.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenues were $293.1 million, which represented an increase of 7.2% from the prior year.  For more information, relating to our revenues, profits and financial condition, please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
We believe that we provide our students with the highest quality career-oriented training available for our areas of study in our markets. We offer programs in areas of study that we believe are typically underserved by traditional providers of post-secondary education and for which we believe there exists significant demand among students and employers. Furthermore, we believe our convenient class scheduling, career-focused curricula and emphasis on job placement offer our students valuable advantages that have been neglected by the traditional academic sector. By combining substantial distance training with traditional classroom-based training led by experienced instructors, we believe we offer our students a unique opportunity to develop practical job skills in many of the key areas of expected job demand. We believe these job skills enable our students to compete effectively for employment opportunities and to pursue salary and career advancement.
 
Impact of COVID-19 on the Company
 
During the first quarter of 2020, COVID-19 began to spread worldwide and has caused significant disruptions to the U.S. and world economies.  In early March 2020, the Company began seeing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic. On March 13, 2020, a national emergency was declared, which made federal funds available to respond to the crisis. Beginning on March 15, 2020, many businesses closed or reduced hours throughout the U.S. to combat the spread of COVID-19. All 50 states have reported cases of COVID-19 and the states have implemented various containment efforts, including lockdowns on non-essential businesses. The circumstances related to COVID-19 are unprecedented, dynamic and evolving and currently, with variants of the virus arising, remain unpredictable.  As the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to change, we could see significant changes to our operations.
 
To date, the impact of COVID-19 has primarily related to transitioning classes from in-person, hands-on learning to online, remote learning and back.  As part of this transition, the Company has incurred additional expenses.  Related to this transition, 102 students have been placed on leave of absence as they could not complete their externships.
 
Additionally, certain programs were extended due to restricted access to externship sites and classroom labs.   In response to COVID-19, we have also implemented initiatives to safeguard our students and our employees in this time of crisis. Due to phased re-opening on a state-by-state basis, our schools have been reopening since May 2020. As of December 31, 2020, all of our schools are open and we expect the majority of the students who were placed on leave or otherwise deferred their programs to finish their programs.

Transition to Distance Learning
 
In the first and second quarters of 2020, the Company quickly transitioned all of its programs from in-person, hands-on learning to online, remote learning.  The Company obtained approvals from the Department of Education (the “DOE”), certain states and agencies to transition to distance learning.  The Company worked with its book vendors to obtain e-books for the students.  The Company has ensured that all students have either received laptops or tablets or that they already owned a device.  The Company has enhanced its education platform for online learning through a software program.  As schools have reopened, we are adhering to social distancing protocols which may differ from school-to-school depending on physical circumstances as well as other factors and we are limiting the number of students on campus at one time.  The schools continue to teach a portion of each program through distance learning and labs are generally taught in-person.
Employees
 
Our employees have been affected by COVID-19 in many ways, including disruptions due to unexpected school and day-care closings, family underemployment or unemployment, and learning how to work remotely and, in some cases, with new tools and technology to learn and to support that work. Our goal has been to support our employees during the present uncertainty while remaining focused on meeting the needs of our students and business continuity. Early in the crisis, we provided employees with information about best practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other viruses and illnesses. We recommended that non-student interfacing employees work from home and we reduced the density and provided physical space for us to implement social distancing protocols for the employees who were required to work in our offices. Later, we enabled substantially all of our workforce to work remotely. In addition, we have limited in-person meetings, non-employee visits to our locations, and non-essential business travel.
 
To further protect the health and welfare of our employees we have also encouraged employees who potentially have been exposed to COVID-19 to self-quarantine for 14 days while we continue to pay them. To ease access to medical assistance, we are waiving co-payments for COVID-19 testing and telemedicine for those employees enrolled in our health insurance plans.  The Company’s vacation policy was enhanced in the second quarter of 2020 to include up to two weeks of payments for unused vacation days for instructors.
 
Community
 
We understand that the communities in which our employees live, work, and serve are also suffering distress as a result of COVID-19. Due to the growing needs of our neighbors, healthcare providers and many of the organizations in place to provide assistance are overburdened. In March 2020, several campuses in the Tri-State (NY, NJ & CT) area donated medical supplies and personal protective equipment to major medical facilities throughout the region.
Operations
 
We have robust pandemic and business continuity plans that include our business units and technology environments. When COVID-19 advanced to a pandemic, we activated our business continuity plan (the “Continuity Plan”). As an element of the Continuity Plan, we activated our Health Communications Response Team (“HCRT”), a group of the corporate senior managers, who directed a series of activities to address the health and safety of our workforce, to assist students, to sustain business operations, to coordinate communication and to address our management of other ongoing pandemic activities.
 
In response to a growing infected population across the United States, as noted above, we executed plans for social-distancing in our facilities and implemented work-from-home contingencies. As the virus spread, we created remote-working capabilities for our employees. We also completed a series of additional steps to appropriately ensure compliance with our telecommuting policy. The policy is designed to create a secure at-home work environment that protects our students’ information and transactions while also providing the necessary technology capabilities to enable effective remote-working for our staff.
 
There has been a modest decline in productivity for certain departments as our personnel have been adjusting to this significant change in work environment. We currently believe our technology infrastructure is sufficient to maintain a remote-working environment for the vast majority of our workforce for the foreseeable future and that productivity should improve as our staff adjust to this significant change in work environment. The level and ability of our employees to continue working from home could change, however, as conditions surrounding COVID-19 evolve and should infections increase, or if there are interruptions in the internet infrastructure where our employees live or if our internet service providers are otherwise adversely affected.
 
Return to In-Person Operations
 
Due to the phase-in of reopening which has been addressed on a state-by-state basis, we reopened our schools and we continue to follow the guidelines released by each state and city in which our schools are located.  The HCRT is continuing to closely monitor the guidelines released by each state and city in which our schools are located for any change.  As part of reopening our schools, we purchased personal protective equipment, are limiting the number of students in classrooms, have separated students by at least 6 feet, have closed/limited all common areas, have increased the sanitation of our facilities, require everyone at the schools to wear a cloth face mask and maintain a daily log of anyone at the school and monitor body temperatures of those at the school through non-contact thermometers.  In a similar way, we are also rotating employees’ schedules to limit/control the number of employees in spaces.

Student Population and Financial Results
 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had placed 102 students on leave of absence due to COVID-19.  It is expected that a majority of these students will complete their externships.
 
The Company has extended the length and graduation dates of a few programs in which distance learning can only be utilized for a small percentage of these programs.
 
The Company has campuses where students live in dorms that are operated by either the Company itself, Collegiate Housing or other housing options.  The majority of the students had returned home and their dorm charges have been reversed.  In addition, at campuses where students have meal plans, the Company’s cafeterias have been closed and all charges for meal plans have been reversed.  For students that remain in dorms, the Company has given the students gift cards to assist in replacing their meal plans.  As the students are returning to campus the dorms have reopened and the schools have limited the number of students in dorms to adhere to social distancing.
 
Extended Student Financing Programs
 
COVID-19 is having far reaching, negative impacts on individuals, businesses, and, consequently, the overall economy. Specifically, COVID-19 has materially disrupted business operations resulting in significantly higher levels of unemployment or underemployment. As a consequence, we expect many of our individual students will experience financial hardship, making it difficult, if not impossible, to meet their payment obligations to us without temporary assistance.
 
As a result of the negative impact on employment from COVID-19, we are observing higher levels of financial hardship for our students, which we expect will lead to higher levels of forbearance, delinquency and defaults. We expect that, left unabated, this deterioration in forbearance, delinquency and default rates will persist until such time as the economy and employment return to relatively normal levels.
 
We expect that, as the economic impact of COVID-19 evolves, we will continue to evaluate the measures we have put in place to assist our students during this unprecedented challenge. We continue to adapt and evolve our collections practices to meet the needs of our students.
 
Business Strategy
 
We strive to strengthen our position as a leading provider of career‑oriented post-secondary education by continuing to pursue the following strategy:
 

• | Expand Existing Areas of Study and Existing Facilities. We believe we can leverage our operations to expand our program offerings in existing areas of study and new high-demand areas of study in the Transportation and Skilled Trades segment to capitalize on demand from students and employers in our target markets. Whenever possible, we seek to replicate programs across our campuses. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize Utilization of Existing Facilities. We are focused on improving capacity utilization of existing facilities through increased enrollments, the introduction of new programs and partnerships with industry. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Market. We plan to deploy our resources to strengthen our brand, invest in new programs and seek opportunities to expand our footprint in new markets. We have a solid portfolio of corporate and industry partners and they are constantly asking us to explore new geographies to serve them better. Regardless of whether we expand our current campuses to take advantage of the operating leverage or establish new campuses, our goal is to remain competitive and prudently deploy our resources. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Teaching Platform. Using the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe we can continue to transform our in-person education model to a hybrid in-person/virtual training model that combines instructor-facilitated online teaching and demonstrations with hands-on labs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our graduates obtain entry-level positions with both small and large corporations.  As of December 31, 2020, we offered these programs at six of our campuses.
Marketing and Student Recruitment
 
We utilize a variety of marketing and recruiting methods to attract students and increase enrollment. Our marketing and recruiting efforts are targeted at prospective students who are high school graduates entering the workforce, or who are currently underemployed or unemployed and require additional training to enter or re-enter the workforce.
 
Marketing and Advertising.  We utilize a fully integrated marketing approach in our lead generation and admissions process that includes the use of traditional media such as television, radio, billboards, direct mail, a variety of print media and event marketing campaigns intended to raise brand awareness. In addition, we continually grow and enhance our digital marketing efforts, which include paid search, search engine optimization, online video and display advertising and social media channels. These channels currently drive the majority of our new student leads and enrollments. Our fully integrated marketing campaigns direct prospective students to contact us directly, visit the Lincoln website or other customized landing pages on the internet where they will find details regarding our programs and campuses and can request additional information regarding the programs that interest them.  Our internal systems enable us to closely monitor and track the effectiveness of each marketing execution on a daily or weekly basis and make adjustments accordingly to enhance our efficiency and limit our student acquisition costs.
 
Referrals.  Referrals from current students, high school counselors and satisfied graduates and their employers have historically represented 16% of our new student starts. Due to COVID-19 referrals were approximately 13% of our new student starts.  Our school administrators actively work with our current students to encourage them to recommend our programs to prospective students. We endeavor to build and retain strong relationships with high school guidance counselors and instructors by offering annual seminars at our training facilities to further familiarize these individuals on the strengths of our programs.
Recruiting.  Our recruiting efforts are conducted by a group of approximately 250 campus-based and field representatives who meet directly with prospective students during presentations conducted at high schools, in the prospective students’ homes or during a visit to one of our campuses.  We also recruit adult career-seekers or career-changers through our campus based representatives.
 
During 2020, we recruited approximately 23% of our students directly out of high school.  Field sales continue to be a large part of our business and developing local community relationships is one of our most important functions.
 
During 2020, COVID-19 has impacted our recruitment efforts in many ways. Many of our students do not need a physical tour in order to commit to a Lincoln school. In addition, representative efficiencies can be had with a virtual interview thus reducing the time frame from student inquiry to application.  The current remote learning in high schools has made it difficult to get in front of high school students as they make career plans.  This has impacted overall student inquiries for 2020 but has only marginally impacted student applications. The Company continues to adapt to these changes and finds different process improvements and efficiencies.
 
Student Admissions, Enrollment and Retention
 
Admissions.  In order to attend our schools, students must have either a high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate (or General Education Development Certificate, GED). In addition, students must complete an admissions interview and complete a learner assessment. We take admissions requirements very seriously as they are the best indicators of our students’ likelihood for program success and completion thus leading to successful employment in the industry. The learner assessment is a questionnaire designed to discover student challenges and address them prior to attending. While each of our programs has different admissions criteria, we screen all applications and counsel prospective students on the most appropriate program to increase the likelihood that our students complete the requisite coursework and obtain and sustain employment following graduation.

Index

Enrollment.  We enroll students continuously throughout the year, with our largest classes enrolling in late summer or early fall following high school graduation. As of December 31, 2020, we had 12,217 students enrolled at 22 campuses which excludes 102 students on leave of absence due to COVID-19 and our average enrollment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 11,729 students which represented an increase of 6.8% from average enrollment in 2019 which excludes 375 average enrollments on leave of absence due to COVID-19.
Retention.  To maximize student retention, the staff at each school is trained to recognize the early warning signs of a potential drop and to assist and advise students on academic, financial and employment matters. We monitor our retention rates by instructor, course, program and school. When we become aware that a particular instructor or program is experiencing a higher than normal dropout rate, we quickly seek to determine the cause of the problem and attempt to correct it. When we identify that a student is experiencing difficulty academically, we offer tutoring. As we moved to online delivery of instruction we saw a slight decline in our student retention rate but we believe this is temporary and will improve as our as faculty become better skilled at online delivery and to ensure that this happens we have developed online teacher training for all faculty.
Job Placement
 
 We believe that assisting our graduates in securing employment after completing their program of study is critical to our mission as a post-secondary educational institution as well as to our ability to attract high quality students and enhance our reputation in the industry.  In addition, we believe that high job placement rates result in low student loan default rates, an important requirement for continued participation in Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (“Title IV Programs”). See Part I, Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment—Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs.”  Accordingly, we dedicate significant resources to maintaining an effective graduate placement program. Our non-destination schools work closely with local employers to ensure that we are training students with skills that local employers seek. Each school has an advisory council comprised of local employers who provide us with direct feedback on how well we are preparing our students to succeed in the workplace. This enables us to tailor our programs to the marketplace. The placement staff in each of our destination schools maintains databases of potential employers throughout the country, allowing us to more effectively assist our graduates in securing employment in their career field upon graduation. Throughout the year, we hold numerous job fairs at our facilities where we provide the opportunity for our students to meet and interact with potential employers.  In addition, many of our schools have internship programs that provide our students with opportunities to work with employers prior to graduation. For example, some of the students in our automotive programs have the opportunity to complete a portion of their hands-on training in an actual work environment. In addition, some of our students in health sciences programs are required to participate in an externship program during which they work in the field as part of their career training. We also assist students with resume writing, interviewing and other job search skills. As a result of COVID-19, many employers temporarily ceased hiring or scaled back their needs while they assessed the impact to their business from the virus.  Consequently, our placement rates declined slightly in 2020, but as more and more businesses reopen, we have seen increased demand for our graduates and we expect that the pressures of the skills gap will once again provide strong employment opportunities for our students.
Human Capital Management
 
Overview
 
We believe that each of our employees plays an important role in our enterprise.  This is particularly true of our faculty.  We are focused on attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel needed to support of our objectives of providing superior education in the programs which our schools address.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,933 employees, including 491 full-time instructors and 391 part-time instructors, and approximately 1,051 employees serving in various administrative and management positions.  We had no seasonal workers. The number of individuals comprising our workforce has stayed largely the same in the last few years and we currently have no expectation of a significant change.
 
Our Board of Directors regularly reviews with management the following areas regarding our human capital management:
 
Staffing Our Schools
 
Our schools typically are staffed by a school president, a director of career services, a director of education, a director of financial-aid, a director of administrative services, a director of admissions and, of course, a variety of instructors, all of whom are industry professionals with experience in the areas of study at that particular school.
 
Our average student/teacher ratio is approximately 16 to 1, however, in 2020 due to COVID-19, our average in-person student/teacher ratio has decreased slightly based on social distancing requirements which varied on a state-by-state basis.

Index

Diversity and Inclusion
 
We strive to create a culture of diversity and inclusion through our human capital management practices.  The achievement of workforce diversity is one important goal in the outreach efforts for professional acquisition.  As a result, since January 1, 2017, our minority workforce percentage has increased from 33.5% to 40.1%.  Further, the generational range of our workforce, at the end of 2020, was approximately equally divided among Baby Boomers, GenXers and Millennials.  Our human resources programs work to eliminate discrimination and harassment in all forms.
Development, Training and Retention
 
The Company employs a staff to attract and engage talent and applies fully integrated recruiting software to track and manage hiring processes for our campuses and corporate functions.  We hire our faculty in accordance with established criteria, including relevant work experience, educational background and accreditation and state regulatory standards. We require meaningful industry experience of our teaching staff in order to maintain the high quality of instruction in all of our programs that we expect and to address current and industry-specific issues in our course content. In addition, we provide intensive instructional training and continuing education, including quarterly instructional development seminars, annual reviews, technical upgrade training, faculty development plans and weekly staff meetings.
 
The Company acknowledges the relevance of managing productivity and efficiency of its workforce.  The Company uses current technology resources for sales and student services tasks, education support, graduate placement services, and internal talent management. Through the application of these technology tools, productivity data are obtained for key positions and used for process improvement, training, and evaluative purposes.
 
The Company recognizes the value to both the Company and our students of employee knowledge and skill development throughout their careers and of preparing current employees for succession opportunities.  Therefore, employees receive position-based training, as well as online access to a multitude of programs designed to support their effectiveness and growth-potential.  The Company identifies high-performing employee participants for acceleration training programs to develop internal candidates for succession opportunities in key functions.
 
Labor Relations
 
 We believe that we have good relationships with all of our employees.  At six of our 22 campuses, the teaching professionals are represented by various unions. These approximately 161 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2021 and 2023.  Those expiring in the short term are in the process of renegotiation.  We believe that we have good relationships with these unions and with the employees covered by these collective bargaining agreements and do not foresee issues with entering into satisfactory new agreements.
Health and Safety; COVID-19 Response
 
The Company considers the well-being and safety of our employees to be of significant importance.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we applied CDC guidance and safety protocols; developed work-from-home options where possible; covered COVID-19 testing and vaccination 100% through our health plans; and reduced the number of personnel and students onsite at any time.   Our COVID-19 management procedures resulted in continuing operations with strong student support and no reductions in force in 2020.
Our Management
 
We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively implement our growth strategy and continue to drive positive educational and employment outcomes for our students. Under the circumstances of the challenging and changing landscape of COVID-19, our management demonstrated its abilities in innovation and resilience.  For discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Competition
 
The for-profit, post-secondary education industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented with no one provider controlling significant market share.  Direct competition between career-oriented schools like ours and traditional four-year colleges or universities is limited. Thus, our main competitors are other for-profit, career-oriented schools, not-for-profit public schools and private schools, and public and private two-year junior and community colleges, most of which are eligible to receive funding under the federal programs of student financial aid authorized by Title IV Programs. Competition is generally based on location, the type of programs offered, the quality of instruction, placement rates, reputation, recruiting and tuition rates; therefore, our competition is different in each market depending on, among other things, the availability of other options. Public institutions are generally able to charge lower tuition than our schools, due in part to government subsidies and other financial sources not available to for-profit schools. In addition, some of our other competitors have a more extensive network of schools and campuses which enables them to recruit students more efficiently from a wider geographic area. Nevertheless, we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our local markets because of the diversity of our program offerings, quality of instruction, the strength of our brands, our reputation and our graduates’ success in securing employment after completing their program of study.

Index

Our competition differs in each market depending on the curriculum that we offer. For example, a school offering automotive technology, healthcare services and skilled trades programs will have a different group of competitors than a school offering healthcare services and IT technology programs. Also, because schools can add new programs within six to twelve months, competition can emerge relatively quickly. Moreover, with the introduction of online education, the number of competitors in each market has increased because students can now attend classes from an online institution. On average, each of our schools has at least three direct competitors and at least a dozen indirect competitors.

We use hazardous materials at our training facilities and campuses, and generate small quantities of regulated waste such as used oil, antifreeze, paint and car batteries. As a result, our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, the use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste, and the clean-up of contamination at our facilities or off-site locations to which we send or have sent waste for disposal. We are also required to obtain permits for our air emissions and to meet operational and maintenance requirements at certain of our campuses. In the event we do not maintain compliance with any of these laws and regulations, or are responsible for a spill or release of hazardous materials, we could incur significant costs for clean-up, damages, and fines or penalties. Climate change has not had and is not expected to have a significant impact on our operations.
Regulatory Environment
 
Students attending our schools finance their education through a combination of personal resources, family contributions, private loans and federal and state financial aid programs. Each of our schools participates in the Title IV Programs, which are administered by the DOE. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 77% (calculated based on cash receipts) of our revenues were derived from the Title IV Programs. Students obtain access to federal student financial aid through a DOE prescribed application and eligibility certification process.
 
In connection with the students’ receipt of federal financial aid under the Title IV Programs, our schools are subject to extensive regulation by governmental agencies and licensing and accrediting bodies. In particular, the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended the (“HEA”), and the regulations issued by the DOE subject us to significant regulatory scrutiny in the form of numerous standards that each of our schools must satisfy in order to participate in the Title IV Programs. To participate in the Title IV Programs, a school must be authorized to offer its programs of instruction by the applicable state education agencies in the states in which it is physically located, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the DOE and be certified as an eligible institution by the DOE. All of our schools are currently offering both online and in-person learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The DOE, accrediting agencies and state agencies have waived certain requirements related to distance education and are permitting our schools to offer programs via distance education.  The DOE defines an eligible institution to consist of both a main campus and its additional locations, if any.  Our schools are either a main campus or an additional location of a main campus. Each of our schools is subject to extensive regulatory requirements imposed by state education agencies, accrediting commissions, and the DOE. Because the DOE periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations, we cannot predict with certainty how Title IV Program requirements will be applied in all circumstances. Our schools also participate in other federal and state financial aid programs that assist students in paying the cost of their education and that impose standards that we must satisfy.
 
State Authorization
 
Each of our schools must be authorized by the applicable education agencies in the states in which the school is physically located, and in some cases other states, in order to operate on ground and online and to grant degrees, diplomas or certificates to its students. State agency authorization is also required in each state in which a school is physically located in order for the school to become and remain eligible to participate in Title IV Programs.  If we are found not to be in compliance with the applicable state regulations and a state seeks to restrict one or more of our business activities within its boundaries, we may not be able to recruit or enroll students in that state and may have to stop providing services in that state, which could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.  Currently, each of our schools is authorized by the applicable state education agencies in the states in which the school is physically located and in which it recruits students.
 
Our schools are subject to extensive, ongoing regulation by each of these states. State laws typically establish standards for instruction, curriculum, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities and equipment, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, student outcomes and other operational matters. State laws and regulations may limit our ability to offer educational programs and to award degrees, diplomas or certificates. It is possible that states could change their state laws and regulations in the future that could impact the Company and its schools. Some states prescribe standards of financial responsibility that are different from, and in certain cases more stringent than, those prescribed by the DOE. Some states require schools to post a surety bond. We have posted surety bonds on behalf of our schools and education representatives with multiple states in a total amount of approximately $12.3 million.

Index

The DOE published regulations that took effect on July 1, 2011, that expanded the requirements for an institution to be considered legally authorized in the state in which it is physically located for Title IV Program purposes.  In some cases, the regulations required states to revise their current requirements and/or to license schools in order for institutions to be deemed legally authorized in those states and, in turn, to participate in Title IV Programs.  If the states do not amend their requirements where necessary and if schools do not receive approvals where necessary that comply with these new requirements, then the institution could be deemed to lack the state authorization necessary to participate in Title IV Programs.  The DOE stated when it published the final regulations that it will not publish a list of states that meet, or fail to meet, the requirements, and it is uncertain how the DOE will interpret these requirements in each state.
 
If any of our schools fail to comply with state licensing requirements, they are subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization. If any one of our schools lost its authorization from the education agency of the state in which the school is located, or failed to comply with the DOE’s state authorization requirements, that school would lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, the Title IV Program eligibility of its related additional locations could be affected, the impacted schools would be unable to offer its programs, and we could be forced to close the schools. If one of our schools lost its state authorization from a state other than the state in which the school is located, the school would not be able to recruit students or to operate in that state.
 
Due to state budget constraints in certain states in which we operate, it is possible that those states may continue to reduce the number of employees in, or curtail the operations of, the state education agencies that oversee our schools. A delay or refusal by any state education agency in approving any changes in our operations that require state approval could prevent us from making such changes or could delay our ability to make such changes.  States periodically change their laws and regulations applicable to our schools and such changes could require us to change our practices and could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.
 
Accreditation
 
Accreditation is a non-governmental process through which a school submits to ongoing qualitative and quantitative review by an organization of peer institutions. Accrediting commissions primarily examine the academic quality of the school’s instructional programs, and a grant of accreditation is generally viewed as confirmation that the school’s programs meet generally accepted academic standards. Accrediting commissions also review the administrative and financial operations of the schools they accredit to ensure that each school has the resources necessary to perform its educational mission.
 
Accreditation by an accrediting commission recognized by the DOE is required for an institution to be certified to participate in Title IV Programs. In order to be recognized by the DOE, accrediting commissions must adopt specific standards for their review of educational institutions. As of December 31, 2020, all 22 of our campuses are nationally accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges, or ACCSC.  The following is a list of the dates on which each campus was accredited by its accrediting commission and the date by which its accreditation must be renewed.

 In early February 2019, the Company received a letter dated January 31, 2019 from ACCSC, which indicated that the ACCSC commission voted to continue our schools on financial reporting with a subsequent review scheduled for ACCSC’s August 2019 meeting.  The commission continued the financial reporting status based on the net working capital deficit, accumulated deficit, and net loss reported in the nine-month financial statements submitted to ACCSC.  The commission recognized the Company’s continued efforts to improve its financial position through, among other things, closing underperforming schools and growing student enrollments, and determined that, while improvements are being realized, additional monitoring of the Company’s financial position is warranted.  The letter required us to submit certain financial information to ACCSC by July 12, 2019 which was timely submitted, and despite the passage of time, we have not received any further communications to date from ACCSC regarding this matter and we remain on financial reporting status.


If one of our schools fails to comply with accrediting commission requirements, the institution and its main and/or branch campuses are subject to the loss of accreditation or may be placed on probation or a special monitoring or reporting status which, if the noncompliance with accrediting commission requirements is not resolved, could result in loss of accreditation or restrictions on the addition of new locations, new programs, or other substantive changes. If any one of our schools loses its accreditation, students attending that school would no longer be eligible to receive Title IV Program funding, and we could be forced to close that school.
 
Programmatic accreditation is the process through which specific programs are reviewed and approved by industry and program-specific accrediting entities. Although programmatic accreditation is not generally necessary for Title IV Program eligibility, such accreditation may be required to allow students to sit for certain licensure exams or to work in a particular profession or career or to meet other requirements.  Failure to obtain or maintain such programmatic accreditation may lead to a decline in enrollments in such programs.
 
Nature of Federal and State Support for Post-Secondary Education
 
The federal government provides a substantial part of the support for post-secondary education through Title IV Programs, in the form of grants and loans to students who can use those funds at any institution that has been certified as eligible by the DOE. Most aid under Title IV Programs is awarded on the basis of financial need, generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending the institution and the expected amount a student and his or her family can reasonably contribute to that cost. A recipient of Title IV Program funds must maintain a satisfactory grade point average and progress in a timely manner toward completion of his or her program of study and must meet other applicable eligibility requirements for the receipt of Title IV Program funds. In addition, each school must ensure that Title IV Program funds are properly accounted for and disbursed in the correct amounts to eligible students and provide reports on recipient data.

Other Financial Assistance Programs
 
Some of our students receive financial aid from federal sources other than Title IV Programs, such as programs administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. In addition, some states also provide financial aid to our students in the form of grants, loans or scholarships. The eligibility requirements for state financial aid and these other federal aid programs vary among the funding agencies and by program. States that provide financial aid to our students are facing significant budgetary constraints and some of these have reduced the level of state financial aid available to our students.  Due to state budgetary shortfalls and constraints in certain states in which we operate, we believe that the overall level of state financial aid for our students is likely to continue to decrease in the near term, but we cannot predict how significant any such reductions will be or how long they will last. Federal budgetary shortfalls and constraints, or decisions by federal lawmakers to limit or prohibit access by our institutions or their students to federal financial aid, could result in a decrease in the level of federal financial aid for our students.
 
In 2020 we derived approximately 8% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from veterans’ benefits programs, which include the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Veteran Readiness and Employment services. To continue participation in veterans’ benefits programs, an institution must comply with certain requirements established by the VA, including that the institution report on the enrollment status of eligible students; maintain student records and make such records available for inspection; follow rules applicable to the individual benefits programs; and comply with applicable limits on the percentage of students receiving certain veterans’ benefits on a program and campus basis.
 
The VA shares responsibility for VA benefit approval and oversight with designated State Approving Agencies (“SAAs”). SAAs play a critical role in evaluating institutions and their programs to determine if they meet VA benefit eligibility requirements. Processes and approval criteria, as well as interpretation of applicable requirements, can vary from state to state. Therefore, approval in one state does not necessarily result in approval in all states.
 
The VA imposes limitations on the percentage of students per program receiving benefits under certain veterans’ benefits programs, unless the program qualifies for certain exemptions. If the VA determines that a program is out of compliance with these limitations, the VA will continue to provide benefits to current students, but new students will not be eligible to use their veterans’ benefits for an affected program until we demonstrate compliance. Additionally, the VA requires a campus be in operation for two years before it can apply to participate in VA benefit programs. All of our campuses are eligible to participate in VA education benefit programs.
 
During 2012, President Obama signed an Executive Order directing the DOD, Veterans Affairs and Education to establish “Principles of Excellence” (“Principles”), based on certain guidelines set forth in the Executive Order, to apply to educational institutions receiving federal funding for service members, veterans and family members. As requested, we provided written confirmation of our intent to comply with the Principles to the VA in June 2012. We are required to comply with the Principles to continue recruitment activities on military installations. Additionally, there is a requirement to possess a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with the DOD as well as with certain individual installations. Our access to bases for student recruitment has become more limited due to recent changes in the Transition Assistance Program (Transition Goals, Plans, Success) and increased enforcement of the MOU requirement. Each of our institutions has an MOU with the DOD. We have MOUs with certain key individual installations and are pursuing MOUs at additional locations; however, some installations will not provide MOUs to institutions that do not teach at the installation. We continue to strengthen and develop relationships with our existing contacts and with new contacts in order to maintain and rebuild our access to military installations.
 
In addition to Title IV Programs and other government-administered programs, all of our schools offer extended financing programs to their students. This extension of credit helps fill the gap between what the student receives from all financial aid sources and what the student may need to cover the full cost of his or her education. Students or their parents can apply to a number of different lenders for this funding at current market interest rates.  We are required to comply with applicable federal and state laws related to certain consumer and educational loans and credit extensions.

Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs
 
To participate in Title IV Programs, an institution must be authorized to offer its programs by the relevant state education agencies in the state in which it is physically located, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the DOE and be certified as eligible by the DOE. The DOE will certify an institution to participate in Title IV Programs only after reviewing and approving an institution’s application to participate in the Title IV Programs. The DOE defines an institution to consist of both a main campus and its additional locations, if any. Under this definition, for DOE purposes as of December 31, 2020 we had the following three institutions, collectively consisting of three main campuses and 19 additional locations:
 

Main Institution/Campus(es) | Additional Location(s) 
----------------------------+--------------------------
Iselin, NJ | Moorestown, NJ 
 | Paramus, NJ 
 | Somerville, MA 
 | Lincoln, RI 
 | Marietta, GA

Each institution must periodically apply to the DOE for continued certification to participate in Title IV Programs. The institution also must apply for recertification when it undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control. The institution also may come under DOE review when it undergoes a substantive change that requires the submission of an application, such as opening an additional location or raising the highest academic credential it offers.  All institutions are recertified on various dates for various periods of time.  The following table sets forth the expiration dates for each of our institutions’ current Title IV Program participation agreements:
 

Institution | Expiration Date of Current Program Participation Agreement 
-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------
Iselin, NJ | December 31, 20221 
Indianapolis, IN | September 30, 20221 
New Britain, CT | December 31, 20221 


1 | Provisionally certified.
--+-------------------------

 
The DOE typically provides provisional certification to an institution following a change in ownership resulting in a change of control and also may provisionally certify an institution for other reasons, including, but not limited to, noncompliance with certain standards of administrative capability and financial responsibility.  All of our institutions are provisionally certified by the DOE.  These institutions generate 100% of the Company’s revenue based on revenues for the 2020 fiscal year.  All of our institutions are provisionally certified based on findings in recent audits of the institutions’ Title IV Program compliance that the DOE alleges identified deficiencies related to DOE regulations regarding an institutions’ level of administrative capability.  An institution that is provisionally certified receives fewer due process rights than those received by other institutions in the event the DOE takes certain adverse actions against the institution, is required to obtain prior DOE approvals of new campuses and educational programs, and may be subject to heightened scrutiny by the DOE.  Provisional certification makes it easier for the DOE to revoke or decline to renew our Title IV eligibility if the DOE under the new administration chooses to take such an action against us and other provisionally certified for-profit schools without undergoing a formal administrative appeal process.  Provisional certification does not otherwise limit an institution’s access to Title IV Program funds.

Index

The DOE is responsible for overseeing compliance with Title IV Program requirements. As a result, each of our schools is subject to detailed oversight and review, and must comply with a complex framework of laws and regulations. Because the DOE periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretation of existing laws and regulations, we cannot predict with certainty how the Title IV Program requirements will be applied in all circumstances.
 
Significant factors relating to Title IV Programs that could adversely affect us include the following:
 
Congressional Action. Political and budgetary concerns significantly affect Title IV Programs. Congress periodically revises the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (“HEA”) and other laws governing Title IV Programs.  Congress is currently considering reauthorization of Title IV Programs, but it is not known if or when Congress will pass final legislation that amends the Higher Education Act or other laws affecting U.S. Federal student aid.
 
In addition, Congress reviews and determines federal appropriations for Title IV Programs on an annual basis. Congress can also make changes in the laws affecting Title IV Programs in the annual appropriations bills and in other laws it enacts between the HEA reauthorizations. Because a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from Title IV Programs, any action by Congress or the DOE that significantly reduces Title IV Program funding, that limits or restricts the ability of our schools, programs, or students to receive funding through the Title IV Programs, or that imposes new restrictions or constraints upon our business or operations could reduce our student enrollment and our revenues, and could increase our administrative costs and require us to modify our practices in order for our schools to comply fully with Title IV Program requirements. The potential for changes that may be adverse to us and other for-profit schools like ours may increase as a result of the change in administration and changes in Congress.
 
Further, current requirements for student or school participation in Title IV Programs may change or one or more of the present Title IV Programs could be replaced by other programs with materially different student or school eligibility requirements.  If we cannot comply with the provisions of the HEA, as they may be amended, or if the cost of such compliance is excessive, or if funding is materially reduced, our revenues or profit margin could be materially adversely affected.
 
Gainful Employment.  In October 2014, the DOE issued final gainful employment regulations requiring each educational program offered by our institutions to achieve threshold rates in at least one of two debt measure categories related to an annual debt to annual earnings ratio and an annual debt to discretionary income ratio.  On July 1, 2019, the DOE issued final regulations that rescind the gainful employment regulations.  The final regulations have an effective date of July 1, 2020, but the DOE stated in an electronic announcement dated June 28, 2019 that institutions may elect to implement immediately the new regulations and that institutions that early implement the regulations will not be required to report gainful employment data for the 2018-2019 award year, to comply with requirements for including a gainful employment disclosure template in their promotional materials or directly distributing the disclosure template to prospective students, to post the gainful employment template and any other gainful employment disclosures required under the gainful employment regulations on their web pages, or to comply with certification requirements for gainful employment.  The DOE stated in the electronic announcement that institutions that do not early implement the new regulations are expected to comply with the existing gainful employment regulations until July 1, 2020.  We have elected to implement the new regulations early and have documented our early implementation of the new regulations as required by the DOE. It is possible that Congress or the DOE could enact or establish new law or regulations that could restore the gainful employment requirements or similar and potentially stricter requirements, but we cannot predict the likelihood, timing or scope of such requirements.
 
 Borrower Defense to Repayment Regulations.  The DOE published proposed regulations on July 31, 2018 that would modify the DOE’s defense to repayment regulations, including regulations regarding, among other things, (i) acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of certain Title IV Program loans; (ii) permitting the use of arbitration clauses and class action waivers in enrollment agreements and (iii) triggering events that would result in recalculating a school’s financial responsibility score and require the school to post a letter of credit or other surety.  On September 23, 2019, the DOE published the final regulations which had a general effective date of July 1, 2020.


Among other things, the new regulations amend the processes for borrowers to receive from DOE a discharge of the obligation to repay certain Title IV Program loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2020 based on certain acts or omissions by the institution or a covered party.  The new and existing DOE regulations establish detailed procedures and standards for the loan discharge processes for periods prior to July 1, 2017, between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2020, and on or after July 1, 2020, including the information required for borrowers to receive a loan discharge, and the authority of the DOE to seek recovery from the institution of the amount of discharged loans.  The regulations also modify certain components of the financial responsibility regulations, including the list of triggering events that could result in the DOE determining that the institution lacks financial responsibility and must submit to the DOE a letter of credit or other form of acceptable financial protection and accept other conditions on the institution’s Title IV Program eligibility. See Part I, Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment – Financial Responsibility Standards.”  The final regulations also generally will permit the use of arbitration clauses and class action waivers while requiring institutions to make certain disclosures to students.

Index

The current and future rules could have a material adverse effect on our schools’ business and results of operations, and the broad sweep of the rules may, in the future, require our schools to submit a letter of credit based on expanded standards of financial responsibility.  See Part I, Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment – Financial Responsibility Standards.”  It also is possible that Congress or the DOE could enact or establish new law or regulations that could restore prior versions of the borrower defense to repayment requirements or similar and potentially stricter requirements, but we cannot predict the likelihood, timing or scope of such requirements.
 
The “90/10 Rule.”   Under the HEA, a proprietary institution that derives more than 90% of its total revenue from Title IV Programs (its “90/10 Rule percentage”) for two consecutive fiscal years becomes immediately ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs and may not reapply for eligibility until the end of at least two fiscal years. An institution with revenues exceeding 90% for a single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification and may be subject to other enforcement measures, including a potential requirement to submit a letter of credit.  See Part I, Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment – Financial Responsibility Standards.”  If an institution violated the 90/10 Rule and became ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs but continued to disburse Title IV Program funds, the DOE would require the institution to repay all Title IV Program funds received by the institution after the effective date of the loss of eligibility.
 
 We have calculated that, for our 2020 fiscal year, our institutions’ 90/10 Rule percentages ranged from 74% to 83%.  For 2019, none of our existing institutions derived more than 90% of their revenues from Title IV Programs.  Our calculations are subject to review by the DOE.


If Congress or the DOE were to amend the 90/10 Rule to treat other forms of federal financial aid as Title IV Program revenue for 90/10 Rule purposes, lower the 90% threshold, or otherwise change the calculation methodology (each of which has been proposed by some Congressional members in proposed legislation), or make other changes to the 90/10 Rule, those changes could make it more difficult for our institutions to comply with the 90/10 Rule.  A loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs for any of our institutions would have a significant impact on the rate at which our students enroll in our programs and on our business and results of operations.
 
Student Loan Defaults.  The HEA limits participation in Title IV Programs by institutions whose former students defaulted on the repayment of federally guaranteed or funded student loans above a prescribed rate (the “cohort default rate”).  The DOE calculates these rates based on the number of students who have defaulted, not the dollar amount of such defaults.  The cohort default rate is calculated on a federal fiscal year basis and measures the percentage of students who enter repayment of a loan during the federal fiscal year and default on the loan on or before the end of the federal fiscal year or the subsequent two federal fiscal years.
 
Under the HEA, an institution whose Federal Family Education Loan, or FFEL, and Federal Direct Loan, or FDL, cohort default rate is 30% or greater for three consecutive federal fiscal years loses eligibility to participate in the FFEL, FDL, and Pell programs for the remainder of the federal fiscal year in which the DOE determines that such institution has lost its eligibility and for the two subsequent federal fiscal years.  An institution whose FFEL and FDL cohort default rate for any single federal fiscal year exceeds 40% loses its eligibility to participate in the FFEL and FDL programs for the remainder of the federal fiscal year in which the DOE determines that such institution has lost its eligibility and for the two subsequent federal fiscal years.  If an institution’s three-year cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30% in two of the three most recent federal fiscal years for which the DOE has issued cohort default rates, the institution may be placed on provisional certification status and could be required to submit a letter of credit to the DOE.  See Part I, Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment – Financial Responsibility Standards.”
 
In September 2020, the DOE released the final cohort default rates for the 2017 federal fiscal year.  These are the most recent final rates published by the DOE.  The rates for our existing institutions for the 2017 federal fiscal year range from 8.0% to 11.0%.  None of our institutions had a cohort default rate equal to or greater than 30% for the 2017 federal fiscal year.
 
In February 2021, the DOE released draft three-year cohort default rates for the 2018 federal fiscal year.  The draft cohort default rates are subject to change pending receipt of the final cohort default rates, which the DOE is expected to publish in September 2021.  The draft rates for our institutions for the 2018 federal fiscal year range from 6.6% to 11.3%.  None of our institutions had draft cohort default rates of 30% or more.
 
Financial Responsibility Standards.
 
All institutions participating in Title IV Programs must satisfy specific standards of financial responsibility. The DOE evaluates institutions for compliance with these standards each year, based on the institution’s annual audited financial statements, as well as following a change in ownership resulting in a change of control of the institution.
 
The most significant financial responsibility measurement is the institution’s composite score, which is calculated by the DOE based on three ratios:
 
 
• | The equity ratio, which measures the institution’s capital resources, ability to borrow and financial viability;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The primary reserve ratio, which measures the institution’s ability to support current operations from expendable resources; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The net income ratio, which measures the institution’s ability to operate at a profit.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 14
 
Index

The DOE assigns a strength factor to the results of each of these ratios on a scale from negative 1.0 to positive 3.0, with negative 1.0 reflecting financial weakness and positive 3.0 reflecting financial strength. The DOE then assigns a weighting percentage to each ratio and adds the weighted scores for the three ratios together to produce a composite score for the institution. The composite score must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further oversight.
 
If an institution’s composite score is below 1.5, but is at least 1.0, it is in a category denominated by the DOE as “the zone.” Under the DOE regulations, institutions that are in the zone typically may be permitted by the DOE to continue to participate in the Title IV Programs by choosing one of two alternatives:  1) the “Zone Alternative” under which an institution is required to make disbursements to students under the Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 (“HCM1”) payment method, or a different payment method other than the advance payment method, and to notify the DOE within 10 days after the occurrence of certain oversight and financial events or 2) submit a letter of credit to the DOE equal to 50 percent of the Title IV Program funds received by the institution during its most recent fiscal year.  The DOE permits an institution to participate under the “Zone Alternative” for a period of up to three consecutive fiscal years.  Under the HCM1 payment method, the institution is required to make Title IV Program disbursements to eligible students and parents before it requests or receives funds for the amount of those disbursements from the DOE.  As long as the student accounts are credited before the funding requests are initiated, an institution is permitted to draw down funds through the DOE’s electronic system for grants management and payments for the amount of disbursements made to eligible students.  Unlike the Heightened Cash Monitoring 2 (“HCM2”) and the reimbursement payment methods, the HCM1 payment method typically does not require schools to submit documentation to the DOE and wait for DOE approval before drawing down Title IV Program funds.  Effective July 1, 2016, a school under HCM1, HCM2 or reimbursement payment methods must also pay any credit balances due to a student before drawing down funds for the amount of those disbursements from the DOE, even if the student or parent provides written authorization for the school to hold the credit balance.
 
If an institution’s composite score is below 1.0, the institution is considered by the DOE to lack financial responsibility. If the DOE determines that an institution does not satisfy the DOE’s financial responsibility standards, depending on its composite score and other factors, that institution may establish its eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs on an alternative basis by, among other things:
 

• | Posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 50% of the total Title IV Program funds received by the institution during the institution’s most recently completed fiscal year; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 10% of the Title IV Program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year accepting provisional certification; complying with additional DOE monitoring requirements and agreeing to receive Title IV Program funds under an arrangement other than the DOE’s standard advance funding arrangement. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The DOE has evaluated the financial responsibility of our institutions on a consolidated basis. We submitted to the DOE our audited financial statements for the 2018 fiscal year reflecting a composite score of 1.1 based upon our calculations. The DOE indicated in a January 13, 2020 letter its determination that our institutions are “in the zone” based on our composite score for the 2018 fiscal year and that we are required to operate under the Zone Alternative requirements, including the requirement to make disbursements under the HCM1 payment method and to notify the DOE within 10 days of the occurrence of certain oversight and financial events. We also are required to submit to the DOE bi-weekly cash balance submissions outlining our available cash on hand, monthly actual and projected cash flow statements, and monthly student rosters.
 
Because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the DOE extended the deadline for institutions to submit audited financial statements.
 
We initially submitted to the DOE our audited financial statements for the 2019 fiscal year on July 2, 2020 and anticipated that our composite score for the year would be 1.6.  The DOE requested that we resubmit 2019 audited financials and composite score calculation utilizing new technical revisions to the composite score calculation that took effect on July 1, 2020.
 
 We prepared an updated submission and composite score calculation in response to the DOE’s notice and resubmitted our financial statements for the 2019 fiscal year on November 13, 2020 with a recalculated composite score of 1.5. Subsequently, on February 16, 2021, we received a letter from the DOE confirming our composite score of 1.5 for fiscal year 2019 as well as removing the Company from the Zone Alternative requirements. However, the Company will remain on HCM1 until we meet certain requirements outlined by the DOE in its letter which we are hopeful will be complete within the next few months.


For the 2020 fiscal year, we calculated our composite score to be 2.7. This score is subject to determination by the DOE based on its review of our consolidated audited financial statements for the 2020 fiscal year, but we believe it is likely that the DOE will determine that our institutions comply with the composite score requirement.
 
On September 23, 2019, the DOE published final regulations with a general effective date of July 1, 2020 that, among other things, modified the list of triggering events that could result in the DOE determining that the institution lacks financial responsibility and must submit to the DOE a letter of credit or other form of acceptable financial protection and accept other conditions on the institution’s Title IV Program eligibility.  The regulations create lists of mandatory triggering events and discretionary triggering events.  An institution is not able to meet its financial or administrative obligations if a mandatory triggering event occurs.  The mandatory triggering events include:
 
 15
 
Index


• | the institution’s recalculated composite score is less than 1.0 as determined by the DOE as a result of an institutional liability from a settlement, final judgment, or final determination in an administrative or judicial action or proceeding brought by a Federal or State entity; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the institution’s recalculated composite score goes from less than 1.5 to less than 1.0 as determined by the DOE as a result of a withdrawal of owner’s equity from the institution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the SEC takes certain actions against the institution or the institution fails to comply with certain filing requirements; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the occurrence of two or more discretionary triggering events (as described below) within a certain time period.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The DOE also may determine that an institution lacks financial responsibility if one of the following discretionary triggering events occurs and the event is likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the institution:
 

• | a show cause or similar order from the institution’s accrediting agency that could result in the withdrawal, revocation or suspension of institutional accreditation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a notice from the institution’s state licensing agency of an intent to withdraw or terminate the institution’s state licensure if the institution does not take steps to comply with state requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a default, delinquency, or other event occurs as a result of an institutional violation of a security or loan agreement that enables the creditor to require an increase in collateral, a change in contractual obligations, an increase in interest rates or payment, or other sanctions, penalties or fees; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a failure to comply with the 90/10 Rule during the institution’s most recently completed fiscal year;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | high annual drop-out rates from the institution as determined by the DOE; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | official cohort default rates of at least 30 percent for the two most recent years unless a pending appeal could sufficiently reduce one of the rates.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The regulations require the institution to notify the DOE of the occurrence of a mandatory or discretionary triggering event and to provide certain information to the DOE to demonstrate why the event does not establish the institution’s lack of financial responsibility or require the submission of a letter of credit or imposition of other requirements.
 
The expanded financial responsibility regulations could result in the DOE recalculating and reducing our composite score to account for DOE estimates of potential losses under one or more of the extensive list of triggering circumstances and also could result in the imposition of conditions and requirements including a requirement to provide a letter of credit or other form of financial protection.
 
It is difficult to predict the amount or duration of any letter of credit requirement that the DOE might impose under the regulation.  The requirement to submit a letter of credit or to accept other conditions or restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our schools’ business and results of operations.
 
Return of Title IV Program Funds.  An institution participating in Title IV Programs must calculate the amount of unearned Title IV Program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completing them, and must return those unearned funds to the DOE or the applicable lending institution in a timely manner, which is generally within 45 days from the date the institution determines that the student has withdrawn.
 
If an institution is cited in an audit or program review for returning Title IV Program funds late for 5% or more of the students in the audit or program review sample or if the regulatory auditor identifies a material weakness in the institution’s report on internal controls relating to the return of unearned Title IV Program funds, the institution may be required to post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE in an amount equal to 25% of the total amount of Title IV Program funds that should have been returned for students who withdrew in the institution’s prior fiscal year.
 
On January 11, 2018, the DOE sent letters to our then Columbia, Maryland and Iselin, New Jersey institutions requiring each institution to submit a letter of credit to the DOE based on findings of late returns of Title IV Program funds in the annual Title IV Program compliance audits submitted to the DOE for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.  Accordingly, we submitted letters of credit in the amounts of $0.5 million and $0.1 million to the DOE by the February 23, 2018 deadline and we continue to comply with the letter of credit requirement.  By letter dated February 16, 2021, the DOE notified us that our Columbia and Iselin institutions failed to comply with the refund requirements based on their 2017, 2018, and 2019 audits.  Consequently, the DOE has required us to maintain with the DOE a letter of credit in the amount of $600,020 until January 31, 2022.
 
Negotiated Rulemaking.  The DOE periodically issues new regulations and guidance that can have an adverse effect on our institutions.  We cannot predict the timing and content of any new regulations or guidance that the DOE may seek to impose or whether and to what extent the DOE under the new administration may issue new regulations and guidance that could adversely impact for-profit schools including our institutions.

On October 15, 2018, the DOE published a notice in the Federal Register announcing its intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee and three subcommittees to develop proposed regulations related to several matters, including, but not limited to, requirements for accrediting agencies in their oversight of member institutions and programs; criteria used by the DOE to recognize accrediting agencies; simplification of the DOE’s recognition and review of accrediting agencies; clarification of the core oversight responsibilities amongst accrediting agencies, states and the DOE to hold institutions accountable; clarification of the permissible arrangements between an institution of higher education and another organization to provide a portion of an educational program; roles and responsibilities of institutions and accrediting agencies in the teach-out process; regulatory changes required to ensure equitable treatment of brick-and-mortar and distance education programs; regulatory changes required to enable expansion of direct assessment programs, distance education, and competency-based education; regulatory changes required to clarify disclosure and other requirements of state authorization; protections to ensure that accreditors recognize and respect institutional mission and evaluate an institution’s policies and educational programs based on that mission; simplification of state authorization requirements related to distance education; defining “regular and substantive interaction” as it relates to distance education; defining the term “credit hour”; defining the requirements related to the length of educational programs and entry level requirements for the occupation; addressing regulatory barriers in the DOE’s institutional eligibility and general provision regulations; addressing direct assessment programs and competency-based education; and other matters. The DOE released draft proposed regulations for consideration and negotiation by the negotiated rulemaking committee and subcommittees that covered additional topics and made additional revisions and updates to the draft proposed regulations prior to subsequent meetings of the committee and subcommittee in early 2019, including, but not limited to, amendments to current regulations regarding the clock to credit hour conversion formula; the requirements for measuring the lengths of certain educational programs; the requirements for returning unearned Title IV Program funds received for students who withdraw before completing their educational programs; and the requirements for measuring a student’s satisfactory academic progress.  The committee and subcommittees completed their meetings in April 2019 and reached consensus on draft proposed regulations.  On June 12, 2019, the DOE published proposed regulations on some of the topics in a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register for public comment and to consider revisions to the regulations in response to the comments before publishing final versions of the regulations.  The regulations have a general effective date of July 1, 2020.
 
On April 2, 2020, the DOE published proposed regulations related primarily to distance education and to topics addressed during negotiated rulemaking committee meetings that took place in early 2019. The proposed regulations address topics including, among other things, correspondence courses, direct assessment programs, foreign institutions, written arrangements with ineligible institutions or organizations to provide a portion of an educational program, requirements for prompt action by the DOE on certain Title IV eligibility applications, requirements related to the length of educational programs and entry level requirements for the occupation, the clock to credit hour conversion formula, the requirements for returning unearned Title IV Program funds received for students who withdraw before completing their educational programs, and the requirements for measuring a student’s satisfactory academic progress. On September 2,2020, the DOE published the final regulations with some amendments and a general effective date of July 1, 2021.
 
Substantial Misrepresentation.  The DOE’s regulations prohibit an institution that participates in the Title IV Programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation of the nature of its educational programs, financial charges, graduate employability or its relationship with the DOE. A “misrepresentation” includes any false, erroneous, or misleading statement (whether made in writing, visually, orally, or through other means) that is made by an eligible institution, by one of its representatives, or by a third party that provides to the institution educational programs, marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services and that is made to a student, prospective student, any member of the public, an accrediting or state agency, or to DOE.  The DOE defines a “substantial misrepresentation” to include any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person’s detriment. The definition of “substantial misrepresentation” is broad and, therefore, it is possible that a statement made by the institution or one of its service providers or representatives could be construed by the DOE to constitute a substantial misrepresentation. If the DOE determines that one of our institutions has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, the DOE may impose sanctions or other conditions upon the institution including, but not limited to, initiating an action to fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs and may seek to discharge students’ loans and impose liabilities upon the institution. See Part I, Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment – Borrower Defense To Repayment Regulations.”
 
School Acquisitions.  When a company acquires a school that is eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, that school undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control as defined by the DOE. Upon such a change of control, a school’s eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs is generally suspended until it has applied for recertification by the DOE as an eligible school under its new ownership, which requires that the school also re-establish its state authorization and accreditation. The DOE may temporarily and provisionally certify an institution seeking approval of a change of control under certain circumstances while the DOE reviews the institution’s application. The time required for the DOE to act on such an application may vary substantially. The DOE recertification of an institution following a change of control will be on a provisional basis. Thus, any plans to expand our business through acquisition of additional schools and have them certified by the DOE to participate in Title IV Programs must take into account the approval requirements of the DOE and the relevant state education agencies and accrediting commissions.

Change of Control.   In addition to school acquisitions, other types of transactions can also cause a change of control. The DOE, most state education agencies and our accrediting commissions have standards pertaining to the change of control of schools, but these standards are not uniform. DOE regulations describe some transactions that constitute a change of control, including the transfer of a controlling interest in the voting stock of an institution or the institution’s parent corporation. For a publicly traded corporation, DOE regulations provide that a change of control occurs in one of two ways: (a) if a person acquires ownership and control of the corporation so that the corporation is required to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing the change of control or (b) if the corporation has a shareholder that owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest shareholder of the corporation, and that shareholder ceases to own at least 25% of such stock or ceases to be the largest shareholder.  These standards are subject to interpretation by the DOE.   A significant purchase or disposition of our common stock could be determined by the DOE to be a change of control under this standard.
 
Most of the states and our accrediting commissions include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change of control although some agencies could determine that the sale or disposition of a smaller interest would result in a change of control. A change of control under the definition of one of these agencies would require the affected school to reaffirm its state authorization or accreditation. Some agencies would require approval prior to a sale or disposition that would result in a change of control in order to maintain authorization or accreditation.  The requirements to obtain such reaffirmation from the states and our accrediting commissions vary widely.
 
A change of control could occur as a result of future transactions in which the Company or our schools are involved. Some corporate reorganizations and some changes in the board of directors of the Company are examples of such transactions. Moreover, the potential adverse effects of a change of control could influence future decisions by us and our shareholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance or redemption of our stock. In addition, the adverse regulatory effect of a change of control also could discourage bids for shares of our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares.
 
Opening Additional Schools and Adding Educational Programs.  For-profit educational institutions must be authorized by their state education agencies and be fully operational for two years before applying to the DOE to participate in Title IV Programs. However, an institution that is certified to participate in Title IV Programs may establish an additional location and apply to participate in Title IV Programs at that location without reference to the two-year requirement, if such additional location satisfies all other applicable DOE eligibility requirements. Our expansion plans are based, in part, on our ability to open new schools as additional locations of our existing institutions and take into account the DOE’s approval requirements.
 
A student may use Title IV Program funds only to pay the costs associated with enrollment in an eligible educational program offered by an institution participating in Title IV Programs. Generally, unless otherwise required by the DOE or by DOE regulations, an institution that is eligible to participate in Title IV Programs may add a new educational program without DOE approval. However, institutions that are provisionally certified may be required to obtain approval of new educational programs.   Our Indianapolis, New Britain, and Columbia institutions are provisionally certified and required to obtain prior DOE approval of new locations and of new educational programs because of our composite score.  If an institution erroneously determines that an educational program is eligible for purposes of Title IV Programs, the institution would likely be liable for repayment of Title IV Program funds provided to students in that educational program. Our expansion plans are based, in part, on our ability to add new educational programs at our existing schools.
 
Some of the state education agencies and our accrediting commission also have requirements that may affect our schools’ ability to open a new campus, establish an additional location of an existing institution or begin offering a new educational program.
 
Closed School Loan Discharges.    The DOE may grant closed school loan discharges of Federal student loans based upon applications by qualified students. The DOE also may initiate discharges on its own for students who have not reenrolled in another Title IV Program eligible school within three years after the closure and who attended campuses that closed on or after November 1, 2013, as did some of our former campuses. If the DOE discharges some or all of these loans, the DOE may seek to recover the cost of the loan discharges from us. On September 3, 2020, we received determination letters asserting liabilities for closed school loan discharges in connection with the closure of three campuses. We subsequently provided additional documentation to the DOE that support reductions in the liability amounts. The DOE subsequently issued letters reducing the liabilities for two of the campuses to approximately $81,000 and $46,000, respectively.  We have paid these amounts to the DOE.  We are currently waiting for the DOE to respond to our response for the third campus.  The DOE asserted liabilities of $412,000, but we provided documentation demonstrating that the liabilities should be reduced to $104,000.  On February 11, 2021, we received a determination letter from the DOE for closed school loan discharges for the closure of a fourth campus in the amount of approximately $74,000.  We expect to provide documentation demonstrating that the liabilities should be reduced to approximately $64,000.  We cannot predict the timing or amount of the outcome of the DOE’s consideration of our response for the third and fourth campuses, nor can we predict any additional loan discharges that the DOE may approve or the liabilities that the DOE may seek from us for these campuses or other campuses that have closed in the past. We have the right to appeal any asserted liabilities under an administrative appeal process within the DOE. We cannot predict the timing or potential outcome of any administrative appeals of any such liabilities.
Administrative Capability.  The DOE assesses the administrative capability of each institution that participates in Title IV Programs under a series of separate standards. Failure to satisfy any of the standards may lead the DOE to find the institution ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs or to place the institution on provisional certification as a condition of its participation. These criteria require, among other things, that the institution:

--+--------------------------------------------------------

 
The DOE has placed three of our institutions on provisional certification based on findings in recent audits of the institutions’ Title IV compliance that the DOE alleges identified deficiencies in regulations related to DOE regulations regarding an institutions’ level of administrative capability.  See Part I. Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment – Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs.”  Failure by us to satisfy any of these or other administrative capability criteria could cause our institutions to be subject to sanctions or other actions by the DOE or to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, which would have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.
 
Restrictions on Payment of Commissions, Bonuses and Other Incentive Payments.  An institution participating in Title IV Programs may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV Program funds. The DOE’s regulations established twelve “safe harbors” identifying types of compensation that could be paid without violating the incentive compensation rule.  On October 29, 2010, the DOE adopted final rules that took effect on July 1, 2011 and amended the incentive compensation rule by, among other things, eliminating the twelve safe harbors (thereby reducing the scope of permissible compensatory payments under the rule) and expanding the scope of compensatory payments and employees subject to the rule.  We cannot predict how the DOE will interpret and enforce the revised incentive compensation rule and the limited published guidance that the DOE has provided, nor how it will apply the rule and guidance to our past, present, and future compensation practices.  The implementation of the final regulations required us to change our compensation practices and has had and will continue to have a significant impact the productivity of our employees, on the retention of our employees and on our business and results of operations.
 
Compliance with Regulatory Standards and Effect of Regulatory Violations.  Our schools are subject to audits, program reviews, site visits, and other reviews by various federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the DOE, the DOE’s Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), state education agencies and other state regulators, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and other federal agencies, and by our accrediting commissions. In addition, each of our institutions must retain an independent certified public accountant to conduct an annual audit of the institution’s administration of Title IV Program funds. The institution must submit the resulting audit report to the DOE for review.  Some of the findings in the annual Title IV Program compliance audits for some of our institutions resulted in the DOE placing those institutions on provisional certification.  See Part I. Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment – Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs.”  On December 16, 2020, the OIG began an audit of our Indianapolis institution to ensure we used the funds provided under the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (“HEERF”) for allowable and intended purposes and to perform limited work on the institution’s cash management practices and HEERF reporting.  We are cooperating with the OIG during its audit of the institution.  To date, the OIG has not issued a draft audit report or any findings arising out of its audit.
 
If one of our schools fails to comply with accrediting or state licensing requirements, such school and its main and/or branch campuses could be subject to the loss of state licensure or accreditation, which in turn could result in a loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs. If the DOE or another agency determined that one of our institutions improperly disbursed Title IV Program funds or violated a provision of the HEA or DOE regulations, the institution could be required to repay such funds and related costs to the DOE and lenders, and could be assessed an administrative fine. The DOE could also place the institution on provisional certification status and/or transfer the institution to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of receiving Title IV Program funds, under which an institution must disburse its own funds to students and document the students’ eligibility for Title IV Program funds before receiving such funds from the DOE.  See Part I, Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment – Financial Responsibility Standards.”

Significant violations of Title IV Program requirements by the Company or any of our institutions could be the basis for the DOE to limit, suspend, terminate, revoke, or decline to renew the participation of the affected institution in Title IV Programs or to seek civil or criminal penalties. Generally, a termination of Title IV Program eligibility extends for 18 months before the institution may apply for reinstatement of its participation. There is no DOE proceeding pending to fine any of our institutions or to limit, suspend or terminate any of our institutions’ participation in Title IV Programs, nor has the DOE notified us of an intent to revoke or decline to renew any of our institutions’ participation in Title IV Programs.
 
We and our schools are also subject to claims and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by federal and state regulatory agencies and our accrediting bodies, but also by third parties, such as present or former students or employees and other members of the public. If we are unable to successfully resolve or defend against any such claim or lawsuit, we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of federal funding, injunctions or other penalties. Moreover, even if we successfully resolve or defend against any such claim or lawsuit, we may have to devote significant financial and management resources in order to reach such a result.
 
 Scrutiny of the For-Profit Postsecondary Education Sector.  In recent years, Congress, the DOE, states, accrediting agencies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), state attorneys general and the media have scrutinized the for-profit postsecondary education sector. Congressional hearings and roundtable discussions were held regarding various aspects of the education industry, including issues surrounding student debt as well as publicly reported student outcomes that may be used as part of an institution’s recruiting and admissions practices, and reports were issued that are highly critical of for-profit colleges and universities. A group of influential U.S. senators, consumer advocacy groups and some media outlets have strongly and repeatedly encouraged the DOE, the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs and its state approving agencies to take action to limit or terminate the participation of institutions such as ours in existing tuition assistance programs. Both major political parties have conveyed significantly different views on how they would propose to reauthorize the Title IV Programs and the various conditions on program or institutional eligibility they would require.  As a result of the election of President Biden and the new leadership of DOE, there is an increased likelihood of scrutiny of our institutions by federal agencies. It is not possible to know how this may affect the Company, however, any actions that limit our participation in Title IV Programs or the amount of student financial aid for which our students are eligible would negatively impact our business.


Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”).  On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, which includes a $2 trillion federal economic relief package providing financial assistance and other relief to individuals and businesses impacted by the spread of COVID-19.  The CARES Act includes provisions for financial assistance and other regulatory relief benefitting students and their postsecondary institutions.
  
Among other things, the CARES Act includes a $14 billion HEERF funds for the DOE to distribute directly to institutions of higher education.  Institutions are required to use at least half of the HEERF funds for emergency grants to students for expenses related to disruptions in campus operations (e.g., food, housing, etc.).  Institutions are permitted to use the remainder of the funds for additional emergency grants to students or to cover institutional costs associated with significant changes to the delivery of instruction due to the COVID-19 emergency, provided that those costs do not include payment to contractors for the provision of pre-enrollment recruitment activities, endowments, or capital outlays associated with facilities related to athletics, sectarian instruction, or religious worship.  The law requires institutions receiving funds to continue to the greatest extent practicable to pay its employees and contractors during the period of any disruptions or closures related to the COVID-19 emergency.
 
The DOE has allocated funds to each institution of higher education based on a formula contained in the CARES Act. The formula is heavily weighted toward institutions with large numbers of Pell Grant recipients.  The DOE allocated $27.4 million to our schools to be distributed in two equal installments which must be utilized by April 30, 2021.  The Company had $13.7 million available in the first installment which was intended for emergency grants to students.  As of December 31, 2020, the Company has distributed $13.3 million to the students and remainder was distributed in January 2021.  As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $13.7 million available from the second installment which is intended for institutional costs and additional emergency grants to students.  As of December 31, 2020, the Company has utilized $5.8 million of these funds for permitted expenses which was netted against the original expenses included in selling, general and administrative on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  The DOE also has published guidance regarding permitted and prohibited use of these funds and requirements for reporting the use of these funds.  If the funds are not spent or accounted for in accordance with applicable requirements, we could be required to return funds or be subject to other sanctions.
 
The CARES Act also contains separate educational provisions that relieve both institutions and students from complying with the requirement to repay Title IV funds following a student’s withdrawal as a result of the COVID-19 emergency.  Ordinarily, when a student withdraws, the institution (and, in some cases, the student) may be required to return unearned portions of the Title IV grant and loan funds awarded for the period.  Institutions will be required to report to the DOE the total amount of grant and loan funds the institution has not returned due to the waiver.  For federal loan borrowers, the CARES Act also directs the DOE to cancel the borrower’s obligation to repay any Direct Loan associated with the relevant period.  The law also expands the options to avoid student withdrawals due to a cessation of attendance by placing students on an approved leave of absence and waives certain requirements normally applicable to a leave of absence.  The CARES Act also allows institutions to exclude from the calculation of a student’s satisfactory academic progress any attempted credits not completed due to the COVID-19 emergency.

Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (“CRRSAA”).  On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law.  This annual appropriations bill contained the CRRSAA.  CRRSAA provided an additional $81.9 billion to the Education Stabilization Fund including $22.7 billion for the HEERF, which were originally created by the CARES Act in March 2020.  The higher education provisions of the CRRSAA are intended in part to provide additional financial assistance benefitting students and their postsecondary institutions in the wake of the spread of COVID-19 across the country and its impact on higher educational institutions.
 
Like the CARES Act, the CRRSAA directs the majority of HEERF funds to a general program providing direct grants to institutions.  Institutions generally must designate “at least the same amount” of the funds for direct grants to students as was required under the CARES Act.  However, for-profit institutions may only use the new HEERF funds for grants to students. The student grants must prioritize students with exceptional need and may be used for any component of the student’s cost of attendance or for emergency costs that arise due to coronavirus, such as tuition, food, housing, health care (including mental health care), or child care.  Public and nonprofit institutions may use the remaining HEERF funds to (1) defray expenses associated with coronavirus (including lost revenue, reimbursement for expenses already incurred, technology costs associated with a transition to distance education, faculty and staff trainings, and payroll); (2) carry out student support activities authorized by the Higher Education Act that address needs related to coronavirus; or (3) for additional financial aid grants to students.
 
   Upon the passage of the CRRSAA, DOE began allocating the funds to each institution of higher education based on a formula contained in the law.  The DOE has allocated a total of $15.4 million to our schools and the funds were made available as of February 2021.  The DOE has begun releasing guidance relating to the use of these funds and is expected to provide additional information in the coming weeks.  Failure to comply with requirements for the usage and reporting of these funds could result in requirements to repay some or all of the allocated funds and in other sanctions.
