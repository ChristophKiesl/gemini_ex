Item 1. Business.
Introduction



We are a blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “business combination”). While we may pursue an acquisition in any business industry or sector, we intend to focus our efforts identifying businesses offering technology-enabled consumer goods and/or service sectors. We intend to focus on companies that have powerful and differentiated relationships with their customers, and that have market-leading insight into how their consumers live, what they need, and how to communicate with them effectively. These companies may serve both domestic and international audiences.



We are focused on identifying companies that would benefit from becoming publicly-traded entities. We believe that our business strategy creates a compelling alternative for a growing company in a traditionally underfunded area to become a public entity and thus gain liquidity, diversify funding sources, and benefit from public market participation.



We have developed the following high-level, non-exclusive investment criteria that we will use to screen for and evaluate target businesses.



We will seek to acquire a business that have strong business fundamentals and that:



Would Benefit Uniquely from our Capabilities — a business where the collective capabilities of our management and advisors can be leveraged to tangibly improve the operations and market position of the target.



Is Sourced Through our Proprietary Channels — we do not expect to participate in broadly marketed processes, but rather will aim to leverage our extensive network to source potential targets.



Has a Committed and Capable Management Team — a business with a professional management team whose interests are aligned with those of our investors and complement the expertise of our founders. Where necessary, we may also look to complement and enhance the capabilities of the target business’s management team by recruiting additional talent through our network of contacts.
Has the Potential to Grow Through Further Acquisition Opportunities — a business that has the platform to grow inorganically through acquisitions.



Offers an Attractive Potential Return for our Stockholders, weighing potential growth opportunities and operational improvements in the target business against any identified downside risks.



These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as on other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).











Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. We have generated no operating revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination.



On October 22, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 23,000,000 units (the “units”), including the issuance of 3,000,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $230 million.



Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we completed the private sale (the “private placement”) of an aggregate of 1,060,000 units (the “private placement units”) to Athena Consumer Acquisition Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per private placement unit, generating gross proceeds of $10,600,000.



Prior to the consummation of the IPO, on June 29, 2021, the Sponsor paid $25,000 to cover certain of our offering costs in exchange for 5,900,000 shares of our Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “founder shares”), and on September 23, 2021, the Company effected a 1.36440678 for 1 stock split of its common stock, resulting in the Sponsor owning an aggregate of 8,050,000 founder shares. Up to 1,050,000 founder shares were subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option was exercised. In connection with the underwriters’ full exercise of their over-allotment option on October 22, 2021, the 1,050,000 founder shares were no longer subject to forfeiture.



A total of $234,600,000, comprised of $230,000,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $8,650,000 of the underwriters’ deferred underwriting commissions, which commissions were subsequently waived in full by Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (“Citi”) on December 8, 2022) and $4,600,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement units, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the “Trust Account”) maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.



The funds held in the Trust Account are invested in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.



On December 21, 2022, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”), at which our stockholders voted in favor of a proposal to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Charter Amendment”) to provide us with the right to extend the date (the “Deadline Date”) by which we must consummate an initial business combination up to six times for an additional one month each time (each, an “Extension”), from January 22, 2023 to up to July 22, 2023. On the same date, we filed the Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. A total of 20,951,064 shares of our Class A common stock were presented for redemption in connection with the Special Meeting, and there were 2,048,936 shares of Class A common stock held by public stockholders (the “public shares”) remaining outstanding following such redemptions.











If an Extension is implemented, the Sponsor or its designees will deposit into the Trust Account, as a loan, the lesser of (x) $121,000 or (y) $0.055 per public share multiplied by the number of public shares outstanding (the “Contribution”), on each of the following dates: (i) January 23, 2023; and (ii) one business day following our public announcement disclosing that our board of directors (the “Board”) has determined to extend the date by which we must consummate an initial business combination for an additional month in accordance with the Extension. As there were 2,048,936 public shares outstanding following redemptions in connection with the Special Meeting, the Contribution amount for each month of the Extension is equal to $112,691.48, which is the product of $0.055 per public share multiplied by the 2,048,936 public shares outstanding, or up to an aggregate of $676,148.88 in the event the Extension is effectuated for the full six months.



As of March 20, 2023, our Board has implemented three Extensions and has extended the Deadline Date from January 22, 2023 for three additional months to April 22, 2023. In connection with these Extensions, the Sponsor has deposited an aggregate of $338,074.44 into the Trust Account, with each Contribution of $112,691.48 deposited on January 23, 2023, February 17, 2023 and March 21, 2023.



As of December 31, 2022, there was $21,752,492 in cash and securities held in the Trust Account, which includes interest income available to us of $3,259,199. $13,612 of cash is held outside the Trust Account, available for working capital needs.



Effecting Our Initial Business Combination



General



We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of the private placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the IPO or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing.



If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination



While we may pursue an acquisition in any business industry or sector, we intend to focus our efforts identifying businesses offering technology-enabled consumer goods and/or services. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits us from effectuating a business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations.



The rules of the NYSE require that we must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our Board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions. While we consider it unlikely that our Board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects.











We will complete our initial business combination only if the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or is otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock or shares of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% fair market value test described above. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination; however, in the event that the business combination does involve more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as our initial business combination for purposes of a seeking stockholder approval or conducting a tender offer, as applicable. 



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, code reviews, security audits, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry.



Each of our directors and officers will own founder shares and/or private placement units following the IPO and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, such officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.



Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary duties (including Athena Technology Acquisition Corp. II). Subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law, none of the members of our management team who are also employed by our Sponsor or its affiliates have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware. If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity (including Athena Technology Acquisition Corp. II) prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law and any other applicable fiduciary duties. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions stating that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.











e.GO Business Combination



On July 28, 2022, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as amended by that certain first amendment to the Business Combination Agreement on September 29, 2022, and as it may be further amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among the Company, Next.e.GO Mobile SE, a German company (“e.GO”), Next.e.GO B.V., a Dutch private limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of e.GO (“TopCo”), and Time is Now Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of TopCo (“Merger Sub”), for the Company’s initial business combination (the “e.GO Business Combination”). Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, among other things, (i) TopCo will issue to the holders of e.GO’s equity securities (the “e.GO Shareholders”) and convertible loan lenders of e.GO (the “Lenders”) an aggregate of up to 79,019,608 newly issued ordinary shares, par value $10.20 per share, of TopCo (the “TopCo Ordinary Shares”), representing aggregate consideration to the e.GO Shareholders of $800,000,000, 30,000,000 of such shares will be unvested and subject to an earn-out (the “Earn-Out Shares”), in exchange for the contribution by the e.GO Shareholders of all of the paid up no-par value shares of e.GO to TopCo and the convertible loans held by the Lenders, assuming that all e.GO Shareholders and Lender participate in the exchange; (ii) each issued and outstanding share of the Company’s Class A common stock will be automatically cancelled and extinguished and converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the surviving company (the “Surviving Company Common Stock”), (iii) each issued and outstanding share of the Company’s Class B common stock will be automatically cancelled and extinguished and converted into a number of shares of Surviving Company Common Stock calculated as the sum of (x) one plus (y) the lower of (a) the total amount funded under the credit agreement, dated September 29, 2022, between e.GO, Brucke Funding LLC, Brucke Agent LLC and certain lenders party thereto (the “Bridge Financing”), divided by $15,000,000 and multiplied with one-fifth and (b) one-fifth; (iv) TopCo will change its legal form from a Dutch private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) to a Dutch public limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap); (v) Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving company and, after giving effect to the merger, becoming a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of TopCo; (vi) each share of the Company’s common stock will be converted into one share of the Surviving Company Common Stock; (vii) immediately thereafter, each of the resulting shares of Surviving Company Common Stock will be automatically exchanged for one TopCo Ordinary Share; and (viii) each outstanding warrant to purchase a share of the Company’s Class A common stock will be converted into a warrant to purchase a TopCo Ordinary Share on the same contractual terms and conditions as were in effect with respect to each warrant prior to the e.GO Business Combination.
Shareholder Undertakings



On July 28, 2022, concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, substantially all of the shareholders of e.GO (who will receive TopCo Ordinary Shares pursuant to and in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement) entered into a shareholder undertaking (the “Shareholder Undertaking”), by and among the Company, e.GO, and the e.GO shareholders party thereto, pursuant to which, among other things, each such e.GO shareholder (i) agreed to grant one or more powers of attorney authorizing the respective persons identified in such powers of attorney (acting on behalf of such e.GO shareholder), among other things, to execute and deliver the documents relating to the e.GO Business Combination to which such e.GO shareholder is or will be a party (including Dutch deeds of issue and German share transfer deeds, among other documents), (ii) undertook to take all necessary or desirable actions in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and the other transaction documents, and (iii) agreed to certain covenants to support the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and the other transaction documents (including by way of restrictions on the sale, disposition or transfer of such e.GO shareholder’s holdings in e.GO), in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Shareholder Undertaking.
Lender Undertaking



On July 28, 2022, concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, Lenders holding substantially all of the outstanding amount under the existing convertible loans entered into a lender undertaking (the “Lender Undertaking”), by and among the Company, e.GO, and the Lenders thereto, pursuant to which, among other things, each such Lender (i) agreed to grant one or more powers of attorney authorizing the respective persons identified in such powers of attorney (acting on behalf of such Lender), among other things, to execute and deliver the documents relating to the e.GO Business Combination to which such Lender is or will be a party, (ii) undertook to take all necessary or desirable actions in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and the other transaction documents, and (iii) agreed to certain covenants to support the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and the other transaction documents (including by ways of restriction on sale, transfer, disposition or conversion of the Lender’s respective rights and obligations as convertible loan lender), in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Lender Undertaking.
Shareholder Lock-Up Agreement



On July 28, 2022, concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, substantially all of e.GO’s shareholders entered into a lock-up agreement, pursuant to which they agreed not to effect any sale or distribution of any equity securities of TopCo issued to them at the closing of the e.GO Business Combination (the “Closing”) until the date that is six months after the Closing (each, a “Shareholder Lock-Up Agreement”) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Shareholder Lock-Up Agreement.
Sponsor Letter Agreement



On July 28, 2022, concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company, the Sponsor, e.GO, TopCo and certain of the Company’s officers and directors (the “Athena Insiders”) entered into a Sponsor Letter Agreement, which was amended on September 29, 2022 (as it may be further amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Sponsor Letter Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Sponsor and the Athena Insiders have agreed to (i) vote all of its, his or her shares of the Company’s Class A common stock to approve and adopt the Business Combination Agreement and the e.GO Business Combination, (ii) waive its, his or her redemption rights with respect to its, his or her shares of the Company’s Class A common stock in connection with the e.GO Business Combination, (iii) not transfer any of its, his or her shares of the Company’s Class A common stock until the Closing or termination of the Business Combination Agreement (except in limited circumstances), (iv) not transfer (a) with respect to the Sponsor, 75% of its TopCo shares and (b) with respect to all other Athena Insiders any of its, his or her TopCo ordinary shares until the date that is 180 days after the Closing (except in limited circumstances), (v) waive any adjustment to the conversion ratio set forth in the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or any other anti-dilution or similar protection with respect to the shares of the Company’s Class B common stock held by the Sponsor or the Athena Insiders, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions contemplated by the Sponsor Letter Agreement.



Pursuant to the Sponsor Letter Agreement, TopCo will indemnify the Sponsor from and against certain liabilities relating to the e.GO Business Combination for a period of six years after the Closing and subject to an aggregate maximum indemnity of $4,000,000.



Permitted Purchases of Our Securities



If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and the NYSE rules. However, (apart from the purchase of the private placement units) they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.











We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. We expect any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.



The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.



Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination


We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is anticipated to be $10.86 per public share as of March 30, 2023. Our initial stockholders, Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares, private placement shares and public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Limitations on Redemptions



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed initial business combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares in connection with such initial business combination, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements, in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such net tangible assets or minimum cash requirements.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE American, we will be required to comply with the NYSE’s stockholder approval rules.



The requirement that we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares by one of the two methods listed above is contained in provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will apply whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on the NYSE American. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon. If we amend such provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with a stockholder meeting.



If we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with a stockholder meeting, we will




● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | file proxy materials with the SEC. 




If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote any founder shares and private placement shares they hold and any public shares purchased during or after the IPO (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As of the date hereof and as a result of redemptions in connection with the Special Meeting, our initial stockholders own approximately 81.6% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, our initial stockholders will be able to approve our initial business combination, even if none of our public stockholders vote in favor of approving the initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction, whether they participate in or abstain from voting, or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction.











If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will




● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.




In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.



Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.



We intend to require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. We believe that this will allow our transfer agent to efficiently process any redemptions without the need for further communication or action from the redeeming public stockholders, which could delay redemptions and result in additional administrative cost. If the proposed initial business combination is not approved and we continue to search for a target company, we will promptly return any certificates or shares delivered by public stockholders who elected to redeem their shares.



Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Stockholder Approval



If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the IPO without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination



We originally had up to 15 months from the closing of our IPO, or until January 22, 2023, to consummate an initial business combination. However, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to six times for an additional one month each time, from January 22, 2023 to up to July 22, 2023 (the date which is 21 months from the closing of our IPO). As of March 20, 2023, our Board has implemented three Extensions and has extended the Deadline Date from January 22, 2023 for three additional months to April 22, 2023. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by the Deadline Date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the Deadline Date.
Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees



We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information



We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events in a Current Report on Form 8-K. Such reports and other information filed by the Company with the SEC are available free of charge on the Company’s website at www.athenaspac.com when such reports are available on the SEC’s website. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet website is located at www.sec.gov. In addition, the Company will provide copies of these documents without charge upon request from us in writing at 442 5th Avenue, New York, NY 10018 or by telephone at (970) 925-1572. The information included on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only.











We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.



We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th.
