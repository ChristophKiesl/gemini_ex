ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of chemical products that improve the quality of life for downstream consumers and promote a sustainable future. Our products comprise a broad range of innovative chemicals and formulations that bring color and vibrancy to a variety of applications, protect and extend product life, and reduce energy consumption. We market our products globally to a diversified group of industrial customers through two segments: Titanium Dioxide, which consists of our TiO2 business, and Performance Additives, which consists of our functional additives, color pigments, timber treatment and water treatment businesses. We are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including those within TiO2, color pigments and functional additives, a leading North American producer of timber treatment products and a leading European producer of water treatment products. Headquartered in Wynyard, U.K., we employ approximately 3,700 associates worldwide and sell our products in more than 120 countries. We became an independent publicly traded company following our IPO and separation from Huntsman in August 2017.
We operate in a variety of end markets, including industrial and architectural paints and coatings, plastics, construction materials, paper, printing inks, pharmaceuticals, food, cosmetics, fibers and films and personal care. Within these end markets, our products serve approximately 3,400 customers globally. Our production capabilities allow us to manufacture a broad range of high quality functional TiO2 products as well as specialty and differentiated TiO2 products that provide critical performance for our customers and sell at a premium for certain end-use applications. Our functional additives, color pigments and timber treatment products provide essential properties for our customers’ end-use applications by enhancing the color and appearance of construction materials and delivering performance benefits in other applications such as corrosion and fade resistance, water repellence and flame suppression. We believe that our global footprint and broad product offerings differentiate us from our competitors and allow us to better meet our customers’ needs.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had total revenues of $1,938 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $136 million, which includes $127 million from our Titanium Dioxide segment and $55 million from our Performance Additives segment.
Our Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives segments have evolved in recent years through certain site closures, reductions in operating costs and new product introductions. We have a well-established position in each of the industries in which we operate. We continue to implement business improvements within our Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives segments which are expected to provide incremental benefit in our earnings as these programs are achieved.

functional TiO2. We also have complementary functional additives, color pigments, timber treatment and water treatment businesses. We have 23 manufacturing facilities operating in nine countries with a total nameplate production capacity of approximately 1.1 million metric tons per year, excluding our plant in Pori, Finland, ongoing closure of which was announced in the third quarter of 2018. Of these facilities, seven are TiO2 manufacturing facilities in Europe, North America and Asia, and 16 are color pigments, functional additives, water treatment and timber treatment manufacturing and processing facilities in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenues were $1,938 million.
Titanium Dioxide Segment
TiO2 is derived from titanium-bearing ores and is a white inert pigment that provides whiteness, opacity and brightness to thousands of everyday items, including coatings, plastics, paper, printing inks, fibers, food and personal care products. We own a portfolio of brands, including the TIOXIDE®, HOMBITAN®, HOMBITEC® and ALTIRIS® ranges, the products for which are produced in our seven manufacturing facilities around the globe (excluding our plant in Pori, Finland, ongoing closure of which was announced in the third quarter of 2018). We service over 1,200 customers in most major industries and geographic regions. Our global manufacturing footprint allows us to service the needs of both local and global customers, including AkzoNobel, Color Tech (US), Ampacet group, Avient, PPG grp, Standridge, Jotun, Sun Chemicals, LyondellBasell, and CPO Guild. Annual industry demand for TiO2 products tends to correlate with GDP growth rates over time and is seasonal. This seasonality is subject to global, regional, end-use application and other factors.
We are among the largest global TiO2 producers, with nameplate production capacity of approximately 602,000 metric tons per year (excluding our plant in Pori, Finland, ongoing closure of which was announced in the third quarter of 2018). We are able to manufacture a broad range of high quality TiO2 products for functional, differentiated and specialty applications. Our specialty and differentiated product grades generally sell at a premium into more specialized applications such as fibers, catalysts, food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. 
There are two manufacturing processes for the production of TiO2; the sulfate process and the chloride process. We believe that the chloride process accounts for approximately 44% of global production capacity. Most end-use applications can use pigments produced by either process, although there are markets that prefer pigment from a specific manufacturing route—for example, the inks market prefers sulfate products whereas the automotive coatings market prefers chloride products. Regional customers typically favor products that are available locally. The sulfate process produces TiO2 in both the rutile and anatase forms, the latter being used in certain high-value specialty applications. 

 | Rutile TiO2 | Anatase TiO2 | Ultrafine TiO2 
Characteristics | Most common form of TiO2. Harder and more durable crystal | Softer, less abrasive pigment, preferred for some specialty applications | Very small particles of either rutile or anatase TiO2 (typically less than 100nm in diameter)
Typical Applications | Coatings, printing inks, PVC window frames, plastic masterbatches | Cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food, polyester fibers, polyamide fibers | Catalysts and cosmetics 

Our production capabilities are distinguished from some of our competitors because of our ability to manufacture high quality TiO2 using both sulfate and chloride manufacturing processes, which gives us the flexibility to tailor our products to meet our customers’ needs. By operating both sulfate and chloride processes, we also have the ability to use a wide range of titanium feedstocks, which enhances the competitiveness of our manufacturing operations, by providing flexibility in the selection of raw materials. This mitigates, to some extent, fluctuations in availability for any particular feedstock and allows us to manage our raw material costs. 
Once an intermediate TiO2 pigment has been produced using either the chloride or sulfate process, it is "finished" into a product with specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications. Co-products from both processes require treatment prior to disposal to comply with environmental regulations. In order to reduce our disposal costs and to increase our cost competitiveness, we have developed and marketed the co-products from the manufacture of titanium dioxide at our facilities. We sell approximately 38% of the co-products generated by our TiO2 business.

We have a broad customer base and have successfully differentiated our business by establishing ourselves as a market leader in a variety of niche end-use applications where the innovation and specialization of our products is rewarded with higher growth prospects and strong customer relationships.

Customers, Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Titanium Dioxide Segment
We serve over 1,200 customers through our Titanium Dioxide segment. These customers produce paints and coatings, plastics, paper, printing inks, fibers and films, pharmaceuticals, food and cosmetics.
Our ten largest customers accounted for 25% of the segment’s sales in 2020 and no single TiO2 customer represented more than 10% of our sales in 2020. Approximately 86% of our TiO2 sales are made directly to customers through our own global sales and technical services network. This network enables us to work directly with our customers and develop a deep understanding of our customers’ needs resulting in valuable relationships. The remaining 14% of sales are made through our distribution network. We maximize the reach of our distribution network by utilizing specialty distributors in selected markets.
Larger customers are typically served via our own sales network and these customers often have annual volume targets with associated pricing mechanisms. Smaller customers are served through a combination of our global sales teams and a distribution network, and the route to market decision is often dependent upon customer size and end-use application.
Our focus is on marketing products and services to higher growth and higher value applications. For example, we believe that our Titanium Dioxide segment is well-positioned to benefit from sectors such as fibers and films, catalysts, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food, where customers’ needs are complex resulting in fewer companies that have the capability to support them. We maximize reach through specialty distributors in selected markets. Our focused sales effort, technical expertise, strong customer service and local manufacturing presence have allowed us to achieve leading market positions in a number of countries.

of a supervisory committee on which each partner has equal representation. Our investment in LPC is accounted for using the equity method.
Viance is our 50%-owned joint venture with DuPont. In the fourth quarter of 2019, it was announced that DuPont and International Flavors and Fragrances, Inc. ("IFF") entered into a definitive agreement for the merger of IFF and DuPont’s Nutrition & Biosciences business. We do not anticipate that this merger will have a material impact on our business. The merger is expected to close during the first quarter of 2021. Upon closure, it is expected that DuPont’s interest in Viance will transfer to IFF. Viance markets our timber treatment products. Our joint venture interest in Viance was acquired as part of the Rockwood acquisition. The joint venture sources all of its products through a contract manufacturing arrangement at our Harrisburg, North Carolina facility, and we bear a disproportionate amount of working capital risk of loss due to the supply arrangement whereby we control manufacturing on Viance’s behalf. As a result, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and as a result, we consolidate the assets, liabilities and operating results of Viance into our consolidated financial statements.
Pacific Iron Products Sdn Bhd ("PIP") is our 50%-owned joint venture with Coogee Chemicals Pty. Ltd. that manufactures products for Venator. It was determined that the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance are raw material supply, manufacturing and sales. In this joint venture we supply all the raw materials through a fixed cost supply contract, operate the manufacturing facility and market the products of the joint venture to customers. Through a fixed price raw materials supply contract with the joint venture we are exposed to the risk related to the fluctuation of raw material pricing. We concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and as a result we consolidate the assets, liabilities and operating results of PIP into our consolidated financial statements.
Raw Materials
Titanium Dioxide Segment
The primary raw materials that are used to produce TiO2 are various types of titanium feedstock, which include ilmenite, rutile, titanium slag (chloride slag and sulfate slag) and synthetic rutile. The world market for titanium-bearing ores has a diverse range of suppliers with the five largest accounting for approximately 40% of global supply. The majority of our titanium-bearing ores are sourced from Canada, Africa, Australia and India. Ore accounts for approximately 57% of TiO2 variable manufacturing costs, while utilities (electricity, gas and steam), sulfuric acid and chlorine collectively account for approximately 25% of variable manufacturing costs.
The majority of the titanium-bearing ores market is transacted on short-term contracts, or longer-term volume contracts with market-based pricing re-negotiated several times per year. This form of market-based ore contract provides flexibility and responsiveness in terms of pricing and quantity obligations.
Performance Additives Segment
Our primary raw materials for our Performance Additives segment are as follows:

 | FunctionalAdditives | Color Pigments | TimberTreatment | WaterChemicals 
Primary raw materials | Barium and zinc based inorganics | Iron oxide particles, scrap iron, copperas, alkali | DCOIT, copper, monoethanolamine | Aluminum hydroxide


The primary raw materials for functional additives production are barite and zinc. We currently source barite from China, where we have long standing supplier relationships and pricing is negotiated largely on a purchase by purchase basis. The quality of zinc required for our business is mainly mined in Australia but can also be sourced from Canada and South America. The majority of our zinc is sourced from two key suppliers with whom we have long standing relationships.
We source our raw material for the majority of our color pigments business from China, the U.S., France and Italy. Key raw materials are iron powder and metal scrap that are sourced from various mid-size and smaller producers primarily on a spot contract basis.
The primary raw materials for our timber treatment business are dichloro-octylisothiazolinone ("DCOIT") and copper. We source the raw materials for the majority of our timber treatment business from China and the U.S. DCOIT is sourced on a long-term contract whereas copper is procured from various mid-size and larger producers primarily on a spot basis.

Table of Contents

The primary raw materials for our water treatment business are aluminum hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, which are widely available from a number of sources and typically sourced through long-term contracts. We also use sulfuric acid which we source internally.
Competition
The global markets in which our business operates are highly competitive and vary according to segment.
Titanium Dioxide Segment
Competition for Titanium Dioxide products is based on price, product quality and service. Our key competitors are The Chemours Company, Tronox Holdings plc ("Tronox"), Kronos Worldwide Inc. and Lomon Billions each of which has the ability to service global markets. Unlike our chloride technology, the sulfate based TiO2 technology used by our Titanium Dioxide segment is widely available. Accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low. The entrance of new competitors into the industry, the ability of existing or future competitors to increase production in low cost markets, and the development of proprietary technology that enables current or future competitors to produce functional grade products at a significantly lower cost, could render our technology uneconomic and reduce our ability to capture improving margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing. 
Competition within the specialty and differentiated TiO2 markets is based on technical expertise in the customers’ applications, customer service, product attributes (such as product form and quality), and price. Product quality is particularly critical in the technically demanding applications in which we focus as inconsistent product quality adversely impacts consistency in the end-product. Our primary competitors within specialty and differentiated TiO2 applications include Fuji Titanium Industry, ISK, Kronos Worldwide Inc., Precheza a.s., Sakai Chemical Industry Co. and Tayca Corporation. 
Performance Additives Segment
Competition within the functional additives market is primarily based on technical expertise, brand recognition, product quality and price. Key competitors for barium-based additives include 20 Microns Ltd, Sakai Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Solvay S.A. and various Chinese barium producers. Key competitors for zinc-based additives include various Chinese lithopone producers.
Competition within the color pigments market is based on price, product quality, technical capability, brand recognition and innovation. Our primary competitors within color pigments include Cathay Pigments Group, Ferro Corporation, Lanxess AG, and Shanghai Yipin Pigments Co., Ltd.
Competition within the timber treatment market is based on price, customer support services, innovative technology, including sustainable solutions and product range. Our primary competitors are Koppers Inc. and Lonza Group. 
Competition within the water treatment market is based on proximity to customers and price. Our primary competitors are Feralco Group and Kemira Oyj.
Intellectual Property
Proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses, and other technology and inventions is important to our businesses. When appropriate, we file patent and trademark applications, often on a global basis, for new product development technologies. For example, we have obtained patents and trademark registrations covering relevant jurisdictions for key product platforms related to Functional Pigments and Additives and Active Materials technologies. These platforms are used for solar reflection (ALTIRIS® pigments), to keep colored surfaces cooler when they are exposed to the sun, enhance air purification, improve catalytic processes (HOMBIKAT®) or lead to products that help manage heat in plastic applications or lead to metal deactivation in cables (SACHTOLITH®). 
We own a total of approximately 680 issued patents and pending patent applications. Our patent portfolio includes approximately 40 issued U.S. patents, approximately 430 patents issued in countries outside the U.S., and 210 pending patent applications, worldwide. While a presumption of validity exists with respect to issued U.S. patents, we cannot assure that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Furthermore, we cannot assure the issuance of any pending patent application, or that if patents do issue, that these patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. Additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner. 
Table of Contents

We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that confidentiality and other agreements into which we enter and have entered will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means.
In addition to our own patents, patent applications, proprietary trade secrets and know-how, we are a party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing us to use trade secrets, know-how and related technology and/or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities. We also have licensed or sub-licensed intellectual property rights to third parties.
Certain of our products are well-known brand names and we have approximately 870 global trademark registrations and applications. Some of these registrations and applications include filings under the Madrid system for the international registration of marks and may confer rights in multiple countries. However, there can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will provide meaningful protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors, or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted. In our Titanium Dioxide segment, we consider our TIOXIDE®, HOMBITAN®, HOMBITEC®, UVTITAN®, HOMBIKAT™, DELTIO® and ALTIRIS® trademarks to be valuable assets. In our Performance Additives segment, we consider BLANC FIXE™, GRANUFIN®, SACHTOLITH®, FERROXIDE®, ECOLIFE™ and NICASAL® trademarks to be valuable assets.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
General
We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to occupational health and safety, process safety, pollution, protection of the environment and natural resources, product management and distribution, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. In the U.S., these laws include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act ("CAA"), the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), as well as the state counterparts of these statutes.
In the EU, we are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety related provisions. EU regulations are automatically applicable to EU member states from the date they enter into force, while directives become binding upon incorporation into member states' national legislation. Incorporation of directives into national law must take place by the deadline set by the relevant directive, usually within two years. Applicable laws include Directive 2004/35/CE on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage, Directive 2008/98/EC on waste ("Waste Framework Directive"), Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste, the Seveso-III Directive on prevention of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, Directive 2000/60/EC known as the EU Water Framework Directive, Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions and Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH"). Additionally, member states operate their own domestic legislation where not prescribed by EU law, including in the core areas of health and safety in the workplace, statutory nuisance and land contamination legislation, which are subject to national jurisdiction.
On January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the EU. As a result, the U.K. was in a transition period through December 31, 2020, during which time EU rules and regulations applicable to U.K. businesses continued to remain in force. In December 2020, the U.K. and the EU announced they had entered into a post-Brexit agreement on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues, potentially avoiding some of the anticipated disruption of a no-deal, hard Brexit. The full effects of Brexit remain unknown as not all details of the required new U.K. legislation is available. In addition, we do not know if the U.K. and the EU will succeed in negotiating certain terms not addressed in the December 2020 Brexit agreement. Based on the U.K. trade deal agreed with the EU at the end of the transition period, we anticipate the following could impact our operations:
•product registration requirements have changed;
•we have transferred our existing EU REACH Only Representative ("OR") responsibilities away from U.K. legal entities;
Table of Contents

•we transferred our REACH registration dossiers held by Venator U.K. legal entities to alternative EU-based entities before the end of the transition period;
•we assigned EU OR to support transactions of our U.K. manufactured products into the EU; and
•we are monitoring developments on the new U.K. REACH regime and will participate, as appropriate, in the initial notification scheme.
In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation. Actual or alleged violations of safety laws, environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, or injunctions limiting or prohibiting our operations altogether. In addition, some environmental laws may impose liability on a strict, joint and several basis. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations and make significant environmental compliance expenditures. Accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities. Information related to EHS matters may also be found in other areas of this report including "Item 1A. Risk Factors," and "Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 22. Commitments and Contingencies —Other Proceedings and Note 23. Environmental, Health and Safety Matters."
We are subject to a wide array of laws governing chemicals, including the regulation of chemical substances and inventories under the Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA") in the U.S., and REACH, and the Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation ("CLP") regulation in Europe. Analogous regimes exist in other parts of the world, including the U.K., China, South Korea, and Taiwan. Several other countries, including Turkey and Russia, have announced that they will be introducing similar systems in the future. In addition, a number of countries where we operate, including the U.K., have adopted rules to conform chemical labeling in accordance with the globally harmonized system. Many of these foreign regulatory regimes are in the process of a multi-year implementation period for these rules. For example, the Globally Harmonised System ("GHS") established a uniform system for the classification, labeling and packaging of certain chemical substances and the European Chemicals Agency ("ECHA") is currently in the process of determining if certain chemicals should be proposed to the European Commission to receive a carcinogenic classification.
Certain of our products are being evaluated under CLP regulation and their classification could negatively impact sales. On May 31, 2016, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety submitted a proposal to ECHA that would classify TiO2 as a Category 1B Carcinogen presumed to have carcinogenic potential for humans by inhalation. On September 14, 2017, the Risk Assessment ("RAC") published their final opinion, which proposed that TiO2 be classified as a Category 2 carcinogen by inhalation. On October 4, 2019, the European Commission published a Delegated Regulation which applies to some forms of TiO2 (in a powder form containing 1% or more of particles with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm). The regulation was adopted on February 4, 2020 and will apply as of October 1, 2021. Member states, however, may choose to apply the regulation at any time after publication. On May 13, 2020, Venator and a number of other applicants filed a legal challenge seeking the annulment of the TiO2 classification in the General Court of the EU. If successful the delegated act will be annulled, however, a decision by the Court is unlikely to be received before mid 2022.
Following the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU, the Health and Safety Executive in the U.K. has now published the U.K.’s mandatory classification and labelling list, which includes the classification of TiO2 as a suspected carcinogen (in a powder form containing 1% or more of particles with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm). The classification will become mandatory in the U.K. beginning October 2021. 
On April 25, 2019, the French Arrêté of April 17, 2019 suspending the placing on the market of foodstuffs containing additive E171 (TiO2) was published in the French Official Journal. The suspension was effective in France for one year beginning January 1, 2020. On December 23, 2020, France extended the national suspension for one year effective until January 1, 2022 extending the restriction on the sale of TiO2 in foodstuffs in France. 
Adoption of the Category 2 Carcinogen classification may require that some end-use products manufactured with TiO2 are classified and labeled in the EU and U.K. as containing a potentially carcinogenic component, which could negatively impact public perception, market demand and prices of products containing TiO2. The classification may also impact our manufacturing operations leading to increased costs. The classification may have additional effects under other EU laws, e.g., those affecting medical and pharmaceutical applications, cosmetics, food packaging and food additives. The classification of TiO2 in the EU could trigger enhanced regulatory scrutiny in other jurisdictions outside the EU, of products containing TiO2 or products from our Performance Additives segment, which may increase our compliance obligations, impact consumer sentiment and decrease market demand.

The classification could also require that waste containing TiO2 meeting the specifications in the classification be classified as hazardous waste, as separately determined by each Member State, which could result in significant impacts on our customers’ products, wastes from our operations and the implementation of Circular Economy efforts within the EU. It is also possible that heightened regulatory scrutiny could lead to claims by employees or consumers of such products alleging adverse health impacts. Finally, the classification of TiO2 as a Category 2 Carcinogen could lead the ECHA to evaluate other products with similar particle characteristics (such as iron oxides or functional additives) for human carcinogenic potential by inhalation, which may ultimately have similar negative impacts on other products within our portfolio.
On October 14, 2020 the European Commission published a Chemical Strategy for Sustainability. This is part of the EU’s zero pollution ambition, which is a key commitment of the European Green Deal. The strategy aims to protect citizens and the environment by reforming chemicals regulation in Europe and regulating substances classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMRs) in consumer products. The strategy may introduce new regulatory categories and impact the future regulation of our products.
 Environmental, Health and Safety Systems
We are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable EHS legal requirements, and we have developed policies and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of EHS legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements, improve the safety of our employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants. We cannot guarantee, however, that these policies and systems will always be effective or that we will be able to manage EHS legal requirements without incurring substantial costs. Although EHS legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with, these EHS management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and reducing overall risk to us.
Environmental Remediation
We have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials. Similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that was disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses. Under some circumstances, the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources. Based on available information, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material effect on our financial statements. At the current time, we are unable to estimate the total cost to remediate contaminated sites.
We are undertaking detailed assessments of the environmental status of three facilities in the EU and one in the US as part of detailed site investigation and remediation processes. The assessment of the environmental status may lead to a requirement for environmental remediation as a part of these processes. Although the detailed assessment of the environmental status at these facilities is not complete, based on available information, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material effect on our financial statements.
Under CERCLA and similar laws in other jurisdictions, a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred, and a current owner or operator may be liable regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release. Outside the U.S., analogous contaminated property laws, such as those in effect in the EU, can hold past owners and/or operators liable for remediation at former facilities. We have not been notified by third parties of claims against us for cleanup liabilities at former facilities or third-party sites, including, but not limited to, sites listed under CERCLA.
Under the RCRA in the U.S. and similar laws in other jurisdictions, we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties as a condition to our hazardous waste permit. Some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use, including on-site waste disposal. We are aware of soil, groundwater or surface contamination from past operations at some of our sites, and we may find contamination at other sites in the future. Similar laws exist in a number of locations in which we currently operate, or previously operated, manufacturing facilities.
During 2018 and 2019, China implemented new laws and regulations covering environmental contamination and created the Ministry for Environment Protection. Based on available information we do not believe that these regulatory changes will have a material effect on our financial statements.
Climate Change
Table of Contents

Globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHGs"), such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth’s climate. Increasing presence of climate change at the top of the global political and media agenda may lead to further domestic regulations and international agreements and commitments to restrict GHG emissions, all of which can lead to the necessity for increased investment in innovative energy sources and increased capital expenditure. 
Recent developments in climate change related policy and regulations include the Green Deal in the EU, mandatory disclosures in the U.K. by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ("TCFD"), the U.K. commitment to becoming carbon neutral by 2050, and similar policy changes and commitments in other nations worldwide including the announcement that the U.S. is rejoining the Paris climate agreement. These changes could affect us in a number of ways including potential requirements to decarbonize manufacturing processes and increased costs of GHG allowances. As with other jurisdictions, our operations in the U.S. may become subject to increasing climate change regulations and we are currently monitoring these developments closely while investigating appropriate climate change strategies to enable us to comply with the new regulations and conform to new disclosure requirements such as TCFD.
We are already managing and reporting GHG emissions, to varying degrees, at our sites worldwide. These locations are subject to a number of existing GHG related laws and regulations. Potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet GHG emission restrictions and/or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. Currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites.
Increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other extreme climatic events. The potential severity of the changes varies in accordance with the Representative Concentration Pathway ("RPC") used to predict the changes, however, they could have adverse effects on our assets and operations. For example, we have a number of operations in low lying areas that may be at increased risk due to flooding, rising sea levels or disruption of operations from more frequent and severe weather events. These potential effects are also included in our investigation into appropriate climate change strategies.
Human Capital Resources
Talent Management
To remain a leading global manufacturer and marketer of chemical products, it is important that we continue to attract and retain exceptional talent. Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage our human capital resources, including attracting, identifying and retaining key talent. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers and availability of qualified individuals.
We believe that our values-based culture is a competitive advantage that is critical to our success and we implement policies that set forth these values including our Business Conduct Guidelines. We pride ourselves on maintaining high ethical standards and integrity, employee health and safety, teamwork, innovation and performance. We emphasize the importance of each of our employees supporting our core values, establishing standards for work ethic, collaboration, and a commitment to deliver results.
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 3,700 associates in our operations around the world of which approximately 2,400 are in Europe, 700 are in the U.K., 400 are in Asia and 200 are in the US. We believe our relations with our employees are good. A significant number of our employees are employed in jurisdictions where they are represented by a local works council consisting of company and employee representatives. A number of our employees are members of unions and we have entered into collective bargaining agreements with these unions on terms that we believe are typical for the industry in which we operate.
We place considerable value on the growth and development of our employees. We take steps to ensure that we keep them informed on matters affecting them, the overall organization as well as on the performance of the Company. We conduct formal and informal meetings with employees, and maintain a Company intranet website with key information and other matters of interest.
We are committed to a policy of recruitment, reward and promotion on the basis of competence and ability and in compliance with all applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those pertaining to protected characteristics or status.

Total Rewards
We invest in our workforce by offering a competitive total rewards package that includes a combination of features, such as salaries and wages, health and wellness benefits, equity incentives, retirement benefits and training and development. We strive to offer a competitive total rewards package that is responsive to local employment markets and employee needs.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our workforce is fundamental to the success of our business. We provide our employees initial and ongoing safety training applicable to their role, to ensure that safety policies and procedures are effectively communicated and implemented. Personal protective equipment is provided to those employees where needed for the employee to safely perform their job function. We have experienced personnel on site at each of our manufacturing locations that are tasked with providing environmental, health and personal safety education and promoting compliance.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been actively managing our business to enact rigorous safety measures across our organization, including stopping non-essential business travel, increasing personal protective equipment requirements, requiring temperature checks at our sites, removing contractors from site where necessary, increasing cleaning and sanitizing measures, implementing social distancing protocols, requiring work-from-home arrangements as appropriate and reducing the amount of employees working at a site at any given time. We continue to evaluate the appropriate measures to have in place to safeguard our employees and our business and we may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend, or as we determine to be in the best interest of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. We expect to continue these measures until we determine that COVID-19 is adequately contained at each relevant location for purposes of safeguarding our employees and our business.
Human Capital Measures
We monitor several key non-financial human capital measures to manage our business including recordable injuries, process incidents, employee gender diversity and average number of people employed by functional area. We are strongly committed to the safety of all our employees as well as providing equal opportunities to our diverse and talented workforce. These measures help our management team focus on safety, promote diversity and maintain proper functional leverage.
