History of the Company



Wave Sync Corp., formerly known as China Bio-Energy Corp., formerly known as China INSOnline Corp., was initially incorporated on December 23, 1988 under the name Lifequest Medical, Inc. (“DEXT”), a Delaware corporation.



On December 6, 2010, the Company entered into an Amendment (the “Amendment”) to a certain share exchange agreement dated November 12, 2010 with Ding Neng Holdings, a British Virgin Islands company (“Ding Neng Holdings”). This share exchange agreement and the Amendment provided for an acquisition transaction in which the Company, through the issuance of shares of its common stock, representing 90% of the issued and outstanding common stock immediately following the closing of this acquisition, acquired 100% of Ding Neng Holdings.



The closing of this acquisition took place on February 10, 2011, on which date, pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement as amended, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Ding Neng Holdings from the shareholders of Ding Neng Holdings. Accordingly, on the closing of the acquisition, the Company, via Ding Neng Holdings, held 100% of Ding Neng Bio-technology Co., Limited, a Hong Kong Company, which held 100% of Zhangzhou Fuhua Biomass Energy Technology Co., Ltd., a wholly-foreign owned enterprise in China (“Fuhua Biomass”), which, via a series of variable interest entity (or VIE) arrangements, controlled the operating company Fujian Zhangzhou Ding Neng Bio-technology Co., Ltd. (“Ding Neng Bio-tech”). In connection of this share exchange, the Company changed its fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31.



The Company and the previous management believed that from late 2011 to 2014, due to change in law, unfavorable market conditions, and lack of effective management, the business of Ding Neng Bio-tech deteriorated significantly and eventually the Company defaulted on various loan obligations. Eventually, Ding Neng Bio-tech completely ceased its operations.



On June 4, 2015, Fuhua Biomass filed a civil action in Haicang District People’s Court of Xiamen, Fujian, PRC against Ding Neng Bio-tech, alleging that the purposes of those certain Consulting Service Agreement, Operating Agreement, Pledge and Security Agreement, Option Agreement, and Voting Rights Proxy Agreement (the “VIE Agreements”) entered into by Fuhua Biomass and Ding Neng Bio-tech on October 28, 2010 had been frustrated, and that these VIE Agreements should be terminated. On July 14, 2015, this case was settled via in-court mediation directed by the Court. As a result, Fuhua Biomass and Ding Neng Bio-tech entered into binding settlement to, among other things, terminate the VIE Agreements.



Given that the Company was unable to exercise effective control over Ding Neng Bio-tech or gain access to Ding Neng Bio-tech’s financial information since 2011, and that the VIE Agreements were terminated, the Company deconsolidated Ding Neng Bio-tech’s financial results. The Company has written off all investments made in Ding Neng Holdings as loss on investment in subsidiary.



Effective November 1, 2021, we completed a 1 for 5 reverse split of our common stock by filing an amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation with the State of Delaware, reducing the issued and outstanding shares of common stock from 59,327,713 to 11,865,542 (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance remained as previously established at 100,000,000 shares. On February 1, 2022, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Amendment”) to change its corporate name from “Wave Sync Corp.” to “New York Holding Corp,” and the corporate action of such name change is pending with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

Corporate Structure

The following flow chart illustrates our Company’s organizational structure as of March 24, 2021:



Competition



Country Club of South Carolina:



The golf industry is an ever-evolving industry where it takes extensive knowledge and experiences to run a fully operational country club. Our Country Club is located one (1) hour from Myrtle Beach, which is the golf capital of America. As a hidden gem only an hour from Myrtle Beach, the Country Club allows for quick rounds of golf at affordable prices without the over-crowded environment. However, our Golf Club faces intense competition because Myrtle Beach offers a diverse array of golf courses like The Dunes Club, which is highly regarded and TPC Myrtle Beach, another competing public course known for its water obstacles.
Center St. Louis:



Center St. Louis boasts one of the largest indoor sports venues in the Midwest. Having some of the larger tenants in the industry allows for Center St. Louis’ continual growth through many avenues. However, to Target’s knowledge, in the next few years, there will be a few new facilities built that will mirror Center St. Louis’ operations, including Bud Dome and PowerPlex in St. Louis, and 417 Athletics in Springfield, Missouri.
Florence Development:



Florence Development has the potential, through development, to become an industry leader in warehouse space and trade. However, there are many industrial parks surrounding the Florence and South Carolina areas, including Port Dillon and Florence Industrial Park off I-95, which we deem as competitors of Florence Development.
Competitive Strength



The Target believes it possesses the following competitive advantages:




● | Country Club: Our long-term members serve as a solid foundation for our customer base. At the Country Club, each hole's greens and tees stand out among the best in the region, and the course layout is no exception.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Center St. Louis: It has a dominating market position in the St. Louis area's indoor recreational sports complexes. In addition to hosting some of the major volleyball and basketball events in the region, Center St. Louis has established ties with some of the most prominent companies in the industry.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Florence Development: It is one of the largest industrial parks in the North and South Carolina built on the almost 1,000 acres of developed and undeveloped land. In addition, the CSX rail line that passes through the site of Florence Development provides an advantage that no other property in the Florence area can offer.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employees



As of March 31, 2022, we had 49 employees, including 13 full-time and 36 part-time employees. There are no collective bargaining contracts covering any of our employees. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.
