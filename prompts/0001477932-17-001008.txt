ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
We design, engineer and assemble micro-wave component based amplifiers that meet individual customer specifications. Our products consists of RF amplifiers and related subsystems, operating at multiple frequencies from 50kHz to 44GHz, including Low Noise Amplifiers, Medium Power Amplifiers, oscillators, filters, and custom assembly designs. We also offer non-recurring engineering services on a project-by-project basis, for a predetermined fixed contractual amount, or on a time plus material basis.
Our Corporate History and Background
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 30, 2010. From inception until August 2012, we were organized as a vehicle to investigate and acquire a target company or business that seeks to be a publicly held corporation. During that time, we had no revenue and our operations were limited to capital formation, organization and development of our business plan. 
Our Products
 
Our products consist of RF amplifiers and related subsystems, operating at multiple frequencies from 50kHz to 44GHz, including Low Noise Amplifiers, Medium Power Amplifiers, oscillators, filters, and custom assembly designs. 
 
New to our list of products is the 18 to 40 GHz wide band low noise amplifier. It is designed mainly for wideband telecommunications such as military and space applications, point to point radios as well as test equipment.
 
Low Noise Amplifiers
 
Low Noise Amplifiers, or LNAs, are amplifiers used in receivers of almost every type of communication system (Wi-Fi, Radar, Satellite, Base station, Cell phone, Radio, etc.) to improve signal strength and increase sensitivity and range of receivers. 
Medium Power Amplifiers
 
Medium Power Amplifers, or MPAs, provide increased output power and gain in transceiver chains to increase signal power and maintain dynamic range and linearity in Radars, Base-stations, Wireless networks, and almost every communication system.
Oscillators
 
Phase Locked Oscillators, or PLOs, and Dielectric Resonator Oscillators, or DROs, are ultra-stable frequency sources and references in transceiver applications that complement the amplifier chain in the transceivers.
Filters
 
Filters discriminate or block out certain frequencies in communication systems to improve dynamic range and NF response. Our filters are low loss and used on the front-end of the receiver chain that provide low degradation in the NF of the system, thereby maintaining and enhancing the signal clarity.

Our Technology
 
Our products are supported by hybrid design topologies that create highly linear Radio Frequency (RF) products that amplify and transform signals with minimal addition of noise, achieving high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and increased receiver sensitivity and range, at a low cost and low power consumption. Our hybrid design topologies include:

· | Discrete Microwave Integrated Circuit (MIC) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------
· | Pseudomorphic High Electron Mobility Transistor (PHEMT)
· | MIC and Low Noise MIC 

 
The discrete topology that we utilize provides various advantages:
 


· | Can easily optimize Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) and Noise Figure 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Flexibility of design; can easily adapt to change of specs, technology, etc.
· | Low DC power consumption 
· | Can control and optimize and gain flatness due to discrete gain stages 


· | Optimum use of MIC technology and experience
--+---------------------------------------------
· | Use of negative bias is not necessary 
· | Better part availability 

 
Our research and development activities are conducted on new product designs to the extent as requested by the customers. The cost of our research and development activities is incorporated into the unit selling prices and, as such, is borne directly by the customers. For the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has incurred research and development costs of $35,369 and $0, respectively.

Manufacturing
 
Our manufacturing facility is located at our corporate office in Bohemia, New York. Our manufacturing process involves the assembly of numerous individual components and precise fine-tuning by production technicians. Our manufacturing facility is estimated to be capable of assembling up 100 amplifiers per month. If we receive larger quantity orders that need to be fulfilled in a short time-frame, or in excess of our capacity at the main facility, we will outsource the assembly by sending kitted raw materials to a qualified contract assembly facility in the local Northeast.
 
We are currently certified to the ISO 9001:2008 standard. ISO 9001 is a uniform worldwide Quality Management System (QMS) standard.
