ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
Valvoline Inc., a Kentucky corporation, is a worldwide producer, marketer and supplier of engine and automotive maintenance products and services. The terms “Valvoline,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “management” and “our” as used herein refer to Valvoline Inc., its predecessors and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where the context indicates otherwise. On September 28, 2016, Valvoline completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common stock and trades on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol, “VVV.”
Valvoline is one of the most recognized and respected premium consumer brands in the global automotive lubricant industry, known for its high quality products and superior levels of service. Established in 1866, Valvoline’s heritage spans over 150 years, during which it has developed powerful name recognition across multiple product and service channels. 
Valvoline Inc. was incorporated in May 2016 as a subsidiary of Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (which together with its predecessors and consolidated subsidiaries is referred to herein as “Ashland”). Prior to this time, Valvoline operated as an unincorporated commercial unit of Ashland. Following a series of restructuring steps prior to the IPO of Valvoline common stock, the Valvoline business was transferred from Ashland to Valvoline such that the Valvoline business included substantially all of the historical Valvoline business, as well as certain other assets and liabilities transferred to Valvoline by Ashland. In connection with the IPO, 34.5 million shares of Valvoline common stock were sold to investors and Ashland retained 170 million shares, representing approximately 83% of the total outstanding shares of Valvoline common stock. 
Company Developments
On May 12, 2017, Ashland distributed all of its remaining interest in Valvoline to Ashland stockholders (the “Distribution”) through a pro rata dividend on shares of Ashland common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date of May 5, 2017, marking the completion of Valvoline's separation from Ashland. Effective upon the Distribution, Ashland no longer owned any shares of Valvoline common stock, and Valvoline was no longer a controlled and consolidated subsidiary of Ashland. 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, Valvoline acquired 43 company-owned stores within the Quick Lubes reportable segment, including 28 stores related to the acquisition of business assets from Time-It Lube LLC and Time-It Lube of Texas, LP in the second fiscal quarter of 2017. 
Reportable Segments
Valvoline’s reporting structure is composed of three reportable segments: Core North America, Quick Lubes and International. Additionally, to reconcile to consolidated results, certain corporate and other non-operational matters are included in Unallocated and other. Refer to the below for a description of each reportable segment: 
Core North America - The Core North America segment sells Valvoline™ and other branded and private label products in the United States and Canada to both retailers for consumers to perform their own automotive maintenance, referred to as “Do-It-Yourself” or “DIY” consumers, as well as to installer customers who use Valvoline products to service vehicles owned by “Do-It-For-Me” or “DIFM” consumers. Valvoline DIY sales are primarily to retail auto parts stores, such as NAPA Auto Parts, AutoZone, O’Reilly Auto Parts and Advance Auto Parts, as well as leading mass merchandisers and independent auto part stores. Valvoline also sells branded products and services to installer customers such as car dealers, general repair shops and third-party quick lube locations, including Goodyear, Monro, Express Oil Change, TBC Retail Group, directly as well as through a national network of approximately 140 distributors. The Valvoline team also sells branded products and solutions to heavy duty customers, such as on-highway fleets and construction companies and has a strategic relationship with Cummins Inc. (“Cummins”), a leading heavy duty engine manufacturer, for co-branding products in the heavy duty business. 
Quick Lubes - The Quick Lubes segment services the passenger car and light truck quick lube market through two platforms: Valvoline’s company-owned and franchised Valvoline Instant Oil ChangeSM (“VIOC”) stores, the second largest U.S. retail quick lube service chain by number of stores; and Express Care™, a quick lube customer platform developed for independent operators who purchase Valvoline motor oil and other products pursuant to contracts while displaying Valvoline branded signage. VIOC centers offer customers a quick, easy and trusted way to maintain their vehicles, utilizing well-trained technicians who have access to a proprietary service process that sets forth rigorous protocols for both the steps that must be followed in the service of vehicles and for interactions 
4

with customers. As of September 30, 2017, the VIOC network consisted of 384 company-owned and 743 franchised locations and operated in 46 states with eleven years of consecutive same-store sales growth for both company-owned and franchised stores (determined on a fiscal year basis, with new stores excluded from the metric until the completion of their first full fiscal year in operation). The Express Care™ platform supports smaller (typically single store) operators that do not fit Valvoline’s franchise model and typically offer other non-quick lube services such as auto repairs and car washes. As of September 30, 2017, there were 316 Express Care™ locations.
International - Valvoline’s International segment sells Valvoline™ and other branded products through wholly-owned affiliates, joint ventures, licensees and independent distributors in approximately 140 countries outside of the United States and Canada. Key international markets include China; India; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”); Latin America; and Australia Pacific. Valvoline has a growing presence in a number of markets, with primary growth targets being China, India and select countries within Latin America. International sales include products for both light duty (passenger cars, light trucks and two wheelers) and heavy duty (heavy trucks, agricultural, mining and construction equipment). Light duty products are sold internationally primarily through distributors to installer customers. Heavy duty products are sold either directly to key customers or through distributors. Valvoline goes to market in its International business segment in three ways: (1) through its own local sales, marketing, and back office support teams; (2) through joint ventures; and (3) through independent distributors. Valvoline has 50/50 joint ventures with Cummins in India, China and Argentina, and smaller joint ventures in select countries in South America and Asia.
Unallocated and other - Unallocated and other generally includes items that are non-operational in nature and not directly attributable to any of the reportable segments, such as components of pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense/income (excluding service costs, which are allocated to the reportable segments), certain significant company-wide restructuring activities and legacy costs or adjustments that relate to divested businesses, including costs related to the separation from Ashland.
The information required by Item 1 with respect to Valvoline's reportable segments and financial information regarding its geographic operations can be found in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Industry Overview
Valvoline participates primarily in the global finished lubricants market. In total, global lubricants demand is estimated to be approximately 11 billion gallons. Demand for passenger car motor oil and motorcycle oil accounted for approximately 21% of global lubricant demand, while the remaining 79% of demand was for commercial and industrial products. The United States has historically accounted for the largest amount of lubricant demand, followed by China and India. The lubricants market is impacted by the following key drivers and trends:

• | Global lubricants market demand is shifting towards higher performance finished lubricants, largely driven by advancements in vehicle/equipment design and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) requirements for improved efficiency, reduced carbon footprints and optimized fuel consumption.


• | There has been increasingly stringent regulation, particularly in North America and Europe, aimed at reducing toxic emissions, which has led to a continuous drive for innovation given changing specifications for lubricants.


• | Between 2007 and 2012, the North American transport lubes market experienced average annual volume declines of 2.7% per annum, due in part to an increase in oil change intervals, which have resulted from changing OEM recommendations and advancements in engine technology. However, market conditions have shown some indications of improvement due to an increase in the number of cars on the road and miles driven.


• | A surge in the number of cars on the road has led to rapid expansion of passenger vehicle lubricant sales in developing regions.

Business and Growth Strategies
The strength of Valvoline’s business model is the ability to generate profitable sales across multiple channels to market, leveraging the Valvoline brand through effective marketing, innovative product technology and the capabilities of the Valvoline team. Valvoline has delivered strong profits and return on capital, with balanced results. Today, Valvoline is a high margin, high free cash flow generating business, with significant growth opportunities. Valvoline’s key business and growth strategies include:

• | growing and strengthening Valvoline’s quick lube network through organic store expansion, opportunistic, high-quality acquisitions in both core and new markets within the VIOC system and strong sales efforts to partner with new Express Care operators, in addition to continued same-store sales growth and profitability within Valvoline’s existing VIOC

5

system stores as a result of attracting new customers and increasing customer satisfaction, customer loyalty and average transaction size;

• | accelerating international growth across key markets where demand for premium lubricants is growing, such as China, India and select countries in Latin America, by building strong distribution channels in under-served geographies, replacing less successful distributors and improving brand awareness among installer customers in those regions; and


• | leveraging innovation, in terms of product development, packaging, marketing and the implementation of Valvoline’s new digital infrastructure, to strengthen market share and profitability.

Competition
The industry is highly competitive and Valvoline faces competition in all product categories and subcategories. Competition is based on several key criteria, including brand recognition, product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, ability to develop products in cooperation with customers and customer service, as well as the ability to bring innovative products or services to the marketplace.

In the Core North America reportable segment, Valvoline’s principal competitors for retail customers are global integrated oil brands, such as Shell, which produces Pennzoil and Quaker State; BP, which produces Castrol; Exxon Mobil, which produces Mobil 1; as well as mid-tier brands and private label producers. With respect to installer customers in the United States and Canada, Valvoline competes with these same major integrated oil brands, many of which have significantly greater financial resources and more diverse portfolios of products and services, leading to greater operating and financial flexibility. 
The Quick Lubes segment competes with other major franchised brands that offer a turn-key operations management system, such as Jiffy Lube (owned by Shell), Grease Monkey, Take 5 Oil Change, and Express Oil Change, as well as national branded companies that offer a professional signage program with limited business model support, similar to Valvoline’s Express Care network, and regional players such as Super-Lube, American Lube Fast and Express Oil Change that are not directly affiliated with a major brand. Valvoline also competes to some degree with automotive dealerships and service stations, which provide quick lube and other preventative maintenance services. Valvoline believes there are over 9,000 existing quick lube stores currently operating in the U.S. market. Jiffy Lube is currently the Company's largest competitor by number of stores with just over 1,900 stores owned or operated by franchisees.
Major competitors of Valvoline’s International business vary by region. Valvoline generally faces strong competition from global integrated oil brands, as these companies have a particularly strong presence in Europe and Asia. In certain markets, Valvoline also competes with regional brands, including brands produced by national oil companies, such as Sinopec in China and Indian Oil in India.
Competitive factors in all of these markets include price, product or service technology, brand awareness and loyalty, customer service, and sales and marketing. Valvoline’s Core North America and International reportable segments also compete on the basis of shelf space and product packaging.
Marketing and Advertising
Valvoline places a high priority on sales and marketing and focuses marketing efforts on areas expected to yield the highest rate of return. Valvoline has dedicated marketing resources in each reportable segment, which are well qualified to reach target customers. The majority of Valvoline’s large customers are supported by direct sales representatives with a number of key customers having dedicated Valvoline teams. In addition, Valvoline has a number of distributors within the Core North America and International reportable segments that represent the Company's products. In Core North America, Valvoline products are sold to consumers through over 30,000 retail outlets, to installer customers with over 12,000 locations, and in Quick Lubes through 1,127 Valvoline-branded franchised and company-owned stores. Valvoline serves the customer base through an extensive sales force and technical support organization, allowing leverage of the technology portfolio and customer relationships globally, while meeting customer demands locally. 
Valvoline uses a variety of marketing techniques to build awareness of, and create demand for, Valvoline products and services. Valvoline advertises through social and digital media, as well as traditional media outlets such as television, print and radio. Valvoline selectively sponsors teams in high performance racing series, including a current sponsorship of Hendrick Motorsports, featuring drivers Dale Earnhardt Jr., Chase Elliott, Jimmie Johnson and Kasey Kahne. In addition, Valvoline sponsors other teams and players in other high performing sports, including the Manchester City Football Club and the Memphis Grizzlies, as well as Valvoline's joint venture sponsorship of renowned Indian cricket player, Virat Kohli. 
Valvoline has also embarked on a digital infrastructure initiative that will enable the use of technology across the entire enterprise. Valvoline believes its digital marketing infrastructure will drive more effective engagement to deliver growth, customer retention and acquisition as a strategic business partner.
Research and Development
Valvoline’s innovation is central to the successful performance of its business. Valvoline research and development is focused on developing new and innovative products to meet the current and future needs of its customers. These products are developed through Valvoline’s “Hands on Expertise” innovation approach, which begins with the mathematical modeling of critical product design elements and extends through field testing. In addition, Valvoline technology centers, located in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific regions, develop solutions for existing and emerging on and off-road equipment. Valvoline’s research and development team also leverages its strong relationships with customers and suppliers to incorporate their feedback into the research and development process. In addition to its own research and development initiatives, Valvoline also conducts limited testing for other entities, which builds its expertise and partially offsets its research and development costs. Expenses for research and development are classified in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which were $13 million in each of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 and $11 million in fiscal 2015. Valvoline anticipates that the Company will continue to incur research and development expenditures in the future to ensure a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services and to help maintain and enhance Valvoline's competitive position.

Intellectual Property
Valvoline is continually seeking to develop new technology and enhance its existing technology. Valvoline has been issued 34 U.S. and 59 international patents and has 17 U.S. and 51 international patent applications pending or published. Valvoline also holds over 2,450 trademarks in various countries around the world, which Valvoline believes are some of its most valuable assets, for which Valvoline dedicates significant resources to protect. These trademarks include the Valvoline trademark and the famous “V” brand logo trademark, which are registered in over 150 countries. In addition, Valvoline uses various trade names and service marks in its business, including ValvolineTM, Valvoline Instant Oil ChangeSM, MaxLifeTM, All Climate™, DuraBlend™, SynPowerTM and Premium BlueTM. Valvoline also has a variety of intellectual property licensing agreements primarily with its franchisees. Valvoline owns over 700 domain names that are used to promote Valvoline products and services and provide information about the Company.
Raw Material Supply and Prices
The key raw materials used in Valvoline’s business are base oils, additives, packaging materials (high density polyethylene bottles, corrugated packaging and steel drums) and ethylene glycol. Valvoline continuously monitors global supply and cost trends of these key raw materials and obtains these raw materials from a diversified network of large global suppliers and regional providers. Valvoline’s sourcing strategy is to ensure supply through contracting a diversified supply base while leveraging market conditions to take advantage of spot opportunities whenever such conditions are available. Valvoline leverages worldwide spend to obtain favorable contract terms from the global suppliers and use the regional providers to ensure market competitiveness and reliability in its supply chain. For materials that must be customized, Valvoline works with market leaders with global footprints and well developed business continuity plans. Valvoline also utilizes the Company’s research and development resources to develop alternative product formulations, which provide flexibility in the event of supply interruptions. Valvoline closely monitors the Company’s supply chain and conducts annual supply risk assessments of its critical suppliers to reduce risk.
Valvoline has a large manufacturing and distribution footprint in the United States, with seven lubricant blending and packaging plants, two distribution centers and several packaging and warehouse locations. Additional lubricant blending and packaging plants are located in Australia and the Netherlands. Valvoline also has a blending and packaging facility in Canada. In addition, Valvoline also uses numerous third-party toll manufacturers and warehouses.
Valvoline seeks to actively manage fluctuations in supply costs, product selling prices and the timing thereof to preserve unit margins. The prices of many of Valvoline’s products fluctuate based on the price of base oil, which is a large percentage of Valvoline’s cost of sales. Historically, base oil prices have been volatile, which sometimes causes sharp cost increases during periods of short supply. Since 2011, base oil supply has increased dramatically while global demand has generally grown at a steady and moderate rate. Although base oil, a derivative of crude, is highly correlated to the global oil market, excess supply of base oil in recent years has contributed to reduced volatility in the base oil market. Base oil prices generally follow crude prices, but the lag period between changes in the price of crude oil and changes in the price of base oil is influenced by whether there is an excess of or shortness in the supply of base oil.  
Valvoline has generally been successful in adjusting product selling prices to react to changes in base oil costs to preserve unit margins. As part of the strategy to mitigate the impact of base oil volatility, Valvoline has negotiated base oil supply contracts with terms that have reduced the impact of changes in the base oil market on Valvoline’s financial results. Valvoline has revised contracts in several of the Company’s sales channels to accelerate the timing of adjustments to selling prices in response to changes in raw material prices. Pricing adjustments to product sold to Valvoline’s larger national or regional installer customer accounts tend to be made pursuant to contract and are often based on movements in published base oil indices. Pricing for product sold to Valvoline’s franchisees is adjusted on a periodic basis pursuant to an agreed upon index (weighted combination of published base oil indices), the composition and weighting of which may be updated from time to time by Valvoline and representatives of Valvoline’s franchisees. Pricing adjustments for product sold to retail customers, private label products in the United States and product sold to smaller installer customer accounts are generally market driven, based on negotiations in light of base oil costs and the pricing strategies of Valvoline’s competitors. 
Backlog
Although Valvoline may experience availability constraints from time to time for certain products, orders are generally filled within 30 days of receiving them. Therefore, Valvoline usually has a product backlog of less than 30 days at any one time, which the Company does not consider material to its business. 
Seasonality
Overall, there is little seasonality in Valvoline’s business. Valvoline's Quick Lubes business and to a lesser extent, its Core North America business tend to experience slightly higher sales volume in the summer months due to summer vacations and increased 
8

driving, as well as during the periods of time leading into holidays. Both businesses also tend to slow a little from October to February due to inclement weather in parts of the United States and Canada. Valvoline’s International business experiences almost no seasonality due to its geographic diversity and the high percentage of its business in the commercial and industrial lubricants market, which is less influenced by weather. 
Environmental and Regulatory Matters
Valvoline is subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local Environmental Health and Safety (“EHS”) laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern matters such as safe working conditions; product stewardship; air emissions; discharges to the land and surface waters; generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials; and the registration and evaluation of chemicals. Valvoline maintains policies and procedures to control EHS risks and monitor compliance with applicable EHS laws and regulations. These laws and regulations also require Valvoline to obtain and comply with permits, registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities. These authorities can modify or revoke the Company's permits, registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions.
Valvoline expects to incur ongoing costs to comply with existing and future EHS requirements, including the cost of a dedicated EHS group that is responsible for ensuring its business maintains compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This responsibility is carried out through training; formulation of and widespread communication of EHS policies; formulation of procedures and working practices; design and implementation of EHS management systems; internal compliance and management assessments; monitoring legislative and regulatory developments that may affect Valvoline's operations; and incident response planning.
Valvoline is also subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies and by the applicable regulatory authorities in countries in which Valvoline’s products are manufactured and sold. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, classification, labeling, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, advertising and marketing of Valvoline’s products. In addition, the Company is subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other countries’ anti-corruption and anti-bribery regimes.
Valvoline could incur substantial costs if the Company were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or other applicable regulations. Liabilities are accrued when Valvoline considers the matter to be probable of loss and the costs can reasonably be estimated. Such costs and accruals are presently not material to Valvoline's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. There can be no assurances that existing or future environmental laws and other regulations applicable to the Company's operations or products will not lead to a material adverse impact on Valvoline's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Employees
As of September 30, 2017, Valvoline had approximately 5,600 employees worldwide (excluding contract employees).
