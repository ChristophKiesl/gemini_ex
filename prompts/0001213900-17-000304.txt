ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
The Industry
 
Biotechnology industry provides breakthrough products and technologies to combat debilitating and rare diseases, reduce our environmental footprint, feed the hungry, use less and cleaner energy, and have safer, cleaner and more efficient industrial manufacturing process.
 
The biotechnology industry is an extremely important sector in the developed world's economies and human health. Biotechnology companies need to spend large research budgets during the R&D period. Usually it will take 12-16 years to develop a new drug and a new medical device. Not only is a small biotechnology company’s R&D budget smaller than a large, well-known biotechnology company or an international company, but the larger companies are typically more attractive to researchers or employers and maintains better R&D resources. However, at this early stage, we are developing our products, which are licensed from a related party which substantially reduces our R&D cost.
 
Business Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on utilizing our licensed technology to (i) enhance the development of pre-existing pharmaceutical products for the treatment of various cancer indications and other diseases, (ii) prospectively identify patients that may respond to such pharmaceutical products and (iii) commercialize such pharmaceutical products for license in various markets. Our business strategy is to integrate research achievements from medical research institutions (such as Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (“MSKCC”) and MD Anderson Cancer Center), by engaging them to conduct clinical trials of translational medicine for Proof of Concept (“POC”) while we retain ownership of the Products, and then out-license the Products to pharmaceutical companies. We currently have no revenue generated from our principal operations in clinical product development through research and development efforts. Currently, our only operation is the research and development of five compound licensed to us by BioLite Inc. (“BioLite”), a company formed in Taiwan who is one of our principal shareholders.

ABV-1501 and ABV-1502 have the same Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient:” Maitake mushroom extract”. IND and study details are as follows:
 

● | The Phase I/II clinical trial was conducted by MSKCC. A total of 34 eligible study subjects was enrolled from 3/2004 to 1/2007. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability. The test drug was oral administration and a polysaccharide extract from Maitake mushroom is associated with both immunologically stimulatory and inhibitory measurable effects in peripheral blood. Cancer patients should be made aware of the fact that botanical agents produce more complex effects than assumed, and may depress as well as enhance immune function. (A phase I/II trial of a polysaccharide extract from Grifola frondosa (Maitake mushroom) in breast cancer patients: immunological effects by Gary Deng · Hong Lin · Andrew Seidman · Monica Fornier · Gabriella D’Andrea ·Kathleen Wesa · Simon Yeung · Susanna Cunningham Rundles ·Andrew J. Vickers · Barrie Cassileth; J Cancer Res Clin Oncol (2009) 135:1215–1221.) The IND number is 68853 and MSKCC received filing confirmation from the FDA on Jan 22, 2004.

● | Does Maitake Mushroom Extract Enhance Hematopoiesis in Myelodysplastic Patients? A Phase II clinical trial. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Primary endpoint: To describe changes in neutrophil counts and neutrophil function in MDS patients following administration of Maitake mushroom extract.
 
This study to see whether Maitake improves the neutrophil count and function in patients with MDS. The neutrophils are white blood cells which help to fight infection.
 
Total 45 subjects.
 Start Date: April 2010
 Completion Date: September 2014
 Sponsor: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
 Collaborator: YUKIGUNI COMPANY
 Collaborator: Weill Medical College of Cornell University
 Principal Investigator: Kathleen Wesa, MD Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
 Full Source of Clinical Trial Data: https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01099917
 
Normally, for non-cancer patients, phase I clinical trials are performed with healthy subjects to test for safety and phase II clinical trials are performed with patient subjects for efficacy as well as safety. But for cancer patients, however, trials of cancer drugs must necessarily involve subjects with cancer, and as such, phase I/II studies involving cancer patients include primary endpoints relating to safety and tolerability, while at times including efficacy as a secondary endpoint.
 
For “Does Maitake Mushroom Extract Enhance Hematopoiesis in Myelodysplastic Patients? A Phase II clinical trial,” conclusions are described as follows: “Maitake was well tolerated. Enhanced in vitro neutrophil and monocyte function following treatment demonstrate that Maitake has beneficial immunomodulatory potential in MDS. Further study is warranted”.
 
Page 32 of the journal article, “ Does Maitake Mushroom Extract Enhance Hematopoiesis in Myelodysplastic Patients?” indicates that there were 45 subjects were enrolled at the beginning of the study, 18 subjects completed treatment, 3 subjects had adverse effects and 24 subjects were not treated.
 

● | Hematopoiesis: is the formation of blood cellular components. All cellular blood components are derived from haematopoietic stem cells. In a healthy adult person, approximately 1011–1012 new blood cells are produced daily in order to maintain steady state levels in the peripheral circulation (Wikipedia). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Myelodysplastic: are a group of diverse bone marrow disorders in which the bone marrow does not produce enough healthy blood cells (Medscape). Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of disorders caused by poorly formed or dysfunctional blood cells. Myelodysplastic syndromes occur when something goes wrong in your bone marrow — the spongy material inside your bones where blood cells are made. Treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes usually focuses on reducing or preventing complications of the disease and its treatments. In certain cases, myelodysplastic syndromes are treated with a bone marrow transplant (Mayo Clinic).

Market Opportunity and Growth Strategy/Business Plan
 
ABVC will focus on the development of new drugs and innovative medical devices to fulfill unmet medical needs. The business model of ABVC is to integrate research achievements from world-renowned medical research institutions (Such as MSKCC and MD Anderson Cancer Center), conduct clinical trials of translational medicine for POC (Proof of Concept), out-license to international pharmaceutical companies, and tap into global market opportunities. In the USA, any qualified clinic can conduct clinical trials. Though we will strive to continue collaborating with top medical research institutions, if for any reason we cannot cooperate with such medical centers, we will select a qualified clinic to further develop the Products. Our primary goal is to pursue collaborations with top medical centers.
 
Our business plan is to conduct and complete Phase II clinical trials for all five of our Products in the US and/or Canada and if we obtain satisfactory results in the Phase II clinical trial for POC for any such compounds, we will seek to out-license any such compounds to big international pharmaceutical companies for further development. Furthermore, we will continue to search for potential products (drugs or medical devices) worldwide to license and develop in North America.
 
The competitive advantages of our business model are:
 
1. Once we complete POC, we will co-develop our product with leading big international pharmaceuticals and in turn, receive more funding for our research and development. In the unlikely event that such pharmaceutical companies cannot be engaged by us to further develop our product, we will seek a qualified clinic as licensee to develop our product, however, our goal is to secure co-development agreements with leading pharmaceutical companies.
 
2. Our business model is to seek sub-licensee companies in the U.S. and Canada and give them rights to manufacture and commercialize Product. We will collect licensing fees in the form of milestone payments and royalties which will allow us to obtain return on investment (ROI) as milestones are reached, prior to first commercial sale, and thus improve our cash flow circumstances.
 
3. By receiving milestone payments and royalties from sub-licensees, we will have sustainable income to develop our company.
 
The biotechnology industry is an extremely important sector in the developed world's economies and human health. Biotechnology companies need to spend large amount of research budget during R&D period. Usually it will take 12-16 years to develop new drug and new medical device. For a small biotechnology company, the R&D budget amount is much smaller compared to a large biotechnology company or an international company. Moreover, a large company can be more attractive to a researcher or employer and maintain better R&D resources. However, at this early stage, we are developing the Products and licensing them from a related party which can substantially reduce our R&D cost.
 
We are currently in confidential negotiations regarding clinical trial agreements for certain of the above-described compounds with potential medical center partners – we are not permitted at this time to disclose any specifics surrounding the negotiations nor the identifies of the potential partners, pursuant to confidentiality agreements. We will disclose the clinical trial agreement details as soon as any are executed. Furthermore, international pharmaceutical companies have contacted us to express interest in certain of our licensed compounds, however, due to confidentiality concerns we are not able to disclose the substance or nature of these discussions at this time.
 
While the risks presented in our risk factors relating to potential side effects and product liability are inherent to any company engaged in drug-development activities, we do not intend to develop any Products beyond the end of phase 2 clinical trials. We anticipate that upon completion of phase 2 clinical trials, we will seek suitable licensees so that all our Products will be licensed out for further development, marketing and sale by large pharmaceutical companies. In such event, we would seek to mitigate this risk in any and all such licensing agreements so that any such potential occurrences will not cause material setbacks to us or its business. 
 
Under the Collaborative Agreement with BioLite and pursuant to existing practice, we shall own all intellectual property developed with respect to the Products in Canada and the U.S., while BioLite shall own all intellectual property developed with respect to the Products outside of Canada and the U.S. We have the right to sublicense our owned intellectual property to develop Products in Canada and the U.S. These rights have been orally granted to us and we intend to amend the Collaborative Agreement to expressly state these rights.

Government Regulation
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor in development, manufacture and marketing of our proposed pharmaceutical products and in our ongoing research and product development activities. The nature and extent to which such regulation applies to us will vary depending on the nature of any products that may be developed by us. We anticipate that many, if not all, of our proposed products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. Our products are subject to rigorous pre-clinical test and clinical trial and other approval procedures of the FDA, and similar regulatory authorities in European and other countries. Various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence clinical trial, Chemistry, Manufacture and Control (CMC) related to such products and their marketing. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and money, and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted.

FDA Approval Process
 
Prior to commencement of clinical studies involving humans, pre-clinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as a part of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin. Typically, human clinical evaluation involves a time-consuming and costly three-phase process. In Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of people to establish safety pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, possible dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. In Phase III, large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing; and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA.
 
The results of the pre-clinical and clinical testing on a non-biologic drug and certain diagnostic drugs are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales. In the case of vaccines or gene and cell therapies, the results of clinical trials are submitted as a Biologics License Application (“BLA”). In responding to a NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or refuse to approve if the FDA determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria. There can be no assurance that approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our proposed products.
 
European and Other Regulatory Approval
 
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries will likely be necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before granting it, even though the relevant product has been approved by the FDA or another authority. As with the FDA, the regulatory authorities in the European Union (“EU”), Australia and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining approval in particular countries varies, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval. In Europe, the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products provides a mechanism for EU-member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing. The EU has established a European agency for the evaluation of medical products, with both a centralized community procedure and a decentralized procedure, the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one-member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries.
 
We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and recommendations relating to the treatment of oocyte donors, the manufacturing environment under which human cells for therapy are derived, safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research work. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action.
