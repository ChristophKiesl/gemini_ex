ITEM 1. Business
PRGX Global, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a global leader in recovery audit and spend analytics, services designed to improve our clients' source-to-pay ("S2P") business processes. We are based in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and serve clients in more than 30 countries. PRGX Global, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Georgia in 1996. At the heart of our services portfolio is the core capability of mining client data to deliver “actionable insights.” Actionable insights allow our clients to improve their financial performance by reducing costs, improving business processes and managing risks.
The vast majority of our revenue comes from recovery audit, a business service based on the mining of tremendous amounts of our clients’ purchasing-related data, looking for billing errors and overpayments made to their third-party suppliers. PRGX is one of the world's leading providers of recovery audit services principally to large businesses with high volumes of transactions and complex pricing arrangements with suppliers. 
We provide services to 75% of top global retailers and a third of the largest companies in the Fortune 500. We earn the largest portion of our revenue from our retail clients. Retailers’ purchases of merchandise for resale are extremely complex due to the high volume of promotions, allowances and rebates provided by suppliers. Recovery audit in the retail industry is a mature service offering and we have been serving many of our retail clients for decades.
The second largest portion of our business is referred to within the recovery audit industry as “commercial” recovery audit. Commercial recovery auditing is the delivery of recovery audit services to clients in industries other than retail, such as telecommunications, automotive and industrial manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, natural resources, financial services, and transportation. A commercial recovery audit is typically less complex in terms of supplier pricing arrangements, scope of purchase transactions made available for audit and depth of audit programs within individual companies.
Another type of recovery audit focuses on auditing complex supplier billings against large services, construction and licensing contracts and is referred to as a “contract compliance” audit. Although relevant to a large portion of our client base, contract compliance audits are more heavily utilized by commercial clients and are a growing part of our business.
We continue to innovate by (a) expanding the breadth of our services, such as introducing new recovery audit claim concepts, (b) improving our audit methodologies, including the acceleration of the audit itself, such that audits increasingly move closer in time to the original transaction with the ultimate goal of real-time and preventative audits, and (c) continued technological advancements, such as the development and enhancement of our proprietary technology platforms and tools that enable our auditors and clients to work more efficiently and deliver greater returns.
Additionally, we provide advanced S2P analytics, leveraging our established expertise to provide insights and solutions to finance, merchandising and procurement functions to improve working capital, optimize purchasing leverage in vendor pricing negotiations, improve insight into product margin and cost of goods, identify and manage risks associated with vendor compliance, improve quality of vendor master data and improve visibility and diagnostics of direct and indirect spend. These capabilities differentiate our business and are applicable to clients in both the retail and commercial markets.
PRGX is unique in that we are a global recovery audit services provider, serving clients in over 30 countries across a multitude of industries. We conduct our operations through three reportable segments: Recovery Audit Services - Americas, Recovery Audit Services - Europe/Asia-Pacific and Adjacent Services. The Recovery Audit Services - Americas segment represents recovery audit services we provide in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and is our largest segment in terms of clients served and revenue generated. The Recovery Audit Services - Europe/Asia-Pacific segment represents recovery audit services we provide in Europe, Asia and the Pacific region and is responsible for a significant portion of our revenue. The Adjacent Services segment includes our software-as-a-service (SaaS) and advisory advanced analytics solutions provided to clients in any country. We report the unallocated portion of corporate selling, general and administrative expenses not specifically attributable to the three reportable segments in Corporate Support. For additional financial information relating to our reporting segments, see Note 2 - Operating Segments and Related Information of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2015, the Company discontinued its HCRA services business. The Company has settled with two of the three Medicare RAC-related third-parties. The Company believes the likelihood of further claims related to the final Medicare RAC contract is remote and does not expect to incur additional charges in future periods related to its HCRA services business. As a result, the associated liability and receivable balances that relate to the final contract were reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2019. The HCRA services business is reported as Discontinued Operations in accordance with GAAP.

The Recovery Audit Industry and PRGX
Many businesses generate substantial volumes of payment transactions involving multiple vendors, numerous discounts and allowances, fluctuating prices and complex pricing arrangements or rate structures. Although these businesses correctly process the vast majority of payment transactions, errors occur in a small percentage of transactions. These errors include, but are not limited to, missed or inaccurate discounts, allowances and rebates, vendor pricing errors, erroneous coding, unapplied credits and duplicate payments. Many factors contribute to the errors, including communication failures between the purchasing and accounts payable departments, complex pricing arrangements or rate structures, personnel turnover and changes in information and accounting systems. Recovery auditing is a business service focused on finding overpayments created by these errors. These audits are either accounts payable audits or contract compliance audits and entail comprehensive and customized data acquisition from the client, frequently including purchasing, receiving, point-of-sale, pricing, deal and contract documentation, emails, and payment data. 
PRGX, like most companies in the recovery audit services industry, generates the majority of its revenue through contingent fee arrangements, sharing a pre-determined percentage of successful claims or “recoveries” generated from an audit. There are certain recovery audit services or types of audits that are billed as a fixed fee or on a time and materials basis, but the majority of our revenue is generated through contingent fee contracts. 
Recovery audit clients generally recover claims by either (a) taking credits against outstanding payables or future purchases from the involved vendors or service providers, or (b) receiving refund checks directly from those vendors or service providers. Industry practice generally dictates the manner in which a client receives the benefit for a recovery audit claim. In many cases, we must satisfy client-specific procedural guidelines before we can submit recovery audit claims for client approval. 
Contracts with recovery audit clients generally vary in length from one year to three years, with some being evergreen. Most of our recovery audit contracts provide that the client may terminate the contract without cause prior to the completion of the term of the agreement by providing relatively short prior written notice of termination. 
As business practices have evolved, PRGX and the recovery audit industry has evolved with them, innovating processes, error identification tools, and claim types to maximize recoveries. The following are a number of factors impacting recovery auditing:

• | Source to Pay Proliferation & Data Complexity. Businesses increasingly are using many different forms of proprietary and third-party technology to manage complex procurement and accounts payable systems in an effort to realize greater operating efficiencies. Many businesses worldwide communicate with vendors electronically, including the use of email, Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) and the Internet or third-party platforms to exchange inventory and sales data, transmit purchase orders, submit invoices, forward shipping and receiving information and remit payments. Though the complexity of capturing the data has increased significantly, these systems capture more detailed data, which should further inform transactional reviews by recovery auditors.


• | Globalization & Global Supply Chain Complexity. As the operations of business enterprises become increasingly multi-national, they often seek service providers with a global reach. Sophistication in systems and processes varies markedly across the global network of suppliers which further drives the need for our services. Companies are sourcing from all parts of the world, at times with minimal understanding of the associated risks. Companies have created vast networks of potential transaction partners that will continue to create complexity and risk throughout the supply chain. PRGX serves clients in more than 30 countries and we believe we are the recovery audit service provider best suited to deliver multi-national audits.


• | Increased Role of Email Documentation in Client Transaction Data. Clients and vendors increasingly document transaction terms in email correspondence that is not integrated into their financial or merchant deal systems, which increases opportunities for errors. To efficiently identify these errors, recovery audit firms must use sophisticated technology-based tools that are able to ingest and search through massive volumes of emails to identify potential errors that then are investigated by the auditors. A comprehensive recovery audit requires the effective use of technology-based email search tools and techniques.


• | Increasing Claim Categories and Accelerating Audits. Traditionally, the focus of a recovery audit was on a simple, or “disbursement,” claim type, such as the duplicate payment of invoices. Enhancements to accounts payable software, particularly large enterprise software solutions used by many large companies, have reduced the extent to which companies make simple disbursement errors. However, the introduction of creative vendor discount programs, complex pricing arrangements and activity-based incentives has led to an increase in auditable transactions and potential sources of error. These transactions are complicated to audit, as the underlying transaction data is difficult to access and recognizing mistakes can be complex. Recovery audit firms such as PRGX with significant industry-specific expertise and sophisticated technology are best equipped to audit these complicated claim categories. Historically these claims were audited months and in some cases years after the original transaction. PRGX is working to bring the timing of auditing closer to the original

transaction. Audit acceleration has multiple benefits, including reduced vendor abrasion for clients, and greater accuracy of claims.

• | Significant Promotional Activity. Trade promotion spending is substantial within the retail trade and significant sums are being spent in categories with numerous transactions and a high potential for errors, such as scan downs, or discounts at the point of sale. Because of the high volume of trade promotion within retail, there are significant opportunities for mistakes and, therefore, auditable claims.


• | Technology Platform. The ability to efficiently and cost-effectively ingest large volumes of structured and unstructured data is critical to providing best-in-class recovery audit services. We believe we have developed the most sophisticated and highest performing large data processing infrastructure in our industry, including the following components of our proprietary Verigon™ Solution Suite, which enable our recovery audit services:


• | the Epiphany Data Foundation™ , which allows us to effectively process and manage our clients’ data in large scale volumes and at superior speeds, accelerating our data processing speeds for both structured and unstructured data sets and supporting our efforts to accelerate audit results and transform our core audit processes; and


• | the Panoptic™ Compliance Audit Platform, which provides a configurable toolkit for tailoring the audit, project, and claims management processes to each of the industry and audit types we serve.

We expect the evolution of the recovery audit industry to continue. In particular, we expect that the industry will continue to move towards the electronic capture and presentation of data, more automated, centralized processing and auditing closer to the time of the payment transaction.
Adjacent Services 
Our Adjacent Services business leverages our significant S2P knowledge, expertise and capabilities, and enables us to provide additional insights and solutions to finance, merchandising and procurement executives, many of whom we have a long history with because of our recovery audit services. Typical Adjacent Services involve applying data science to our clients' structured and unstructured data to solve challenging business problems, such as improving working capital, optimizing purchasing leverage in vendor pricing negotiations, improving insight into product margin and cost of goods for resale, identifying and managing risks associated with vendor compliance, improving the quality of vendor master data and improving visibility and diagnostics of direct and indirect spend.
Our Adjacent Services business includes our supplier information management (“SIM”) and deduction management solutions as well as S2P analytics tools offered as part of our Lumen™ Advanced Analytics, a combination of technology and applied data science methodologies used to derive actionable insights from the S2P data now explorable within the Epiphany Data Foundation. As our clients’ supplier base, data volumes and complexity levels continue to grow, we are using our deep data management experience to develop new actionable insight solutions, compliance-related tools, analytics solutions and data transformation services. Taken together, our deep understanding of our clients’ S2P data and our Adjacent Services solutions provide multiple routes to help our clients achieve greater profitability.
Clients
PRGX provides its services principally to large businesses having a high volume of payment transactions and complex procurement environments. Retailers continue to constitute the largest part of our client and revenue base. Our five largest clients contributed to our revenue from continuing operations by approximately 36.6% in 2019, 35.4% in 2018 and 36.6% in 2017. We have one client, The Kroger Co., that accounted for approximately 10% of our revenue from continuing operations in 2019, and 12% of our revenue from continuing operations in 2018 and 2017.
Some organizations (primarily large retailers) maintain internal recovery audit departments to recover certain types of payment errors and identify opportunities to reduce costs. Despite having such internal resources, many companies also retain independent recovery audit firms, such as PRGX, due to their specialized knowledge, capabilities and focused technologies. In the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Mexico, Brazil, and Australia, large retailers routinely engage independent recovery audit firms as a standard business practice. It is typical in the retail industry for large firms to engage a primary audit firm at one contingency fee rate and a secondary firm to audit behind the primary at a higher rate. Our commercial recovery audit clients are typically Fortune 1000 companies in industries other than retail and with multi-billion dollars of purchase transactions to be audited. These clients range from large multi-national manufacturing and resource companies, to large regional or national telecommunications and financial services institutions to global high-tech software organizations. The contract compliance audit practice is a specific type of recovery auditing which is more heavily utilized by commercial clients and is expected to be a growing part of our business. This service offering focuses on auditing complex supplier billings against large services, construction and licensing contracts, and is relevant to a large portion of our client base.

The PRGX Strategy 
PRGX is a global leader in recovery audit and spend analytics, services designed to improve our clients' S2P business processes. Our solutions include services and technologies for recovery audit, contract compliance, and advanced analytics. We principally offer our solutions to large businesses with a high volume of payment transactions and complex procurement environments. 
We plan to achieve revenue growth and higher profitability through the following strategy:
1.Grow our core recovery audit business through continued process and technology innovation; 
2.Differentiate our service offerings and capabilities;
3.Increase the global adoption of contract compliance auditing, which has demonstrated value across many industries and
regions; and
4.Expand our clients' use of advanced analytics to improve their S2P business processes
Grow our core recovery audit business through continued process and technology innovation
We continue to be the industry leader by introducing innovative audit concepts and processes. In addition, we are deploying global best practices and rolling out world-class proprietary technology platforms and audit tools to drive deeper recoveries and enable next generation audit concepts. We expect to achieve our growth objectives through process redesign coupled with investments in our technology infrastructure and implementing our new technologies across our global audits.
Differentiate our service offerings and capabilities
We plan to differentiate our service offerings and capabilities by enhancing our current services and implementing innovations such as:

• | Audit acceleration. Our clients are constantly seeking to accelerate the recovery audit process to deliver audit results closer to the time of the transaction to increase recovery yields, provide a greater opportunity to address process errors, and reduce supplier abrasion. We believe that our deep and broad business process experience across thousands of audits, together with our enhanced and new technology initiatives will uniquely position us to achieve superior results for our clients.


• | Global audit best-practice programs. Our global programs take advantage of our best-practice audit operations that serve clients in over 30 countries to provide true global audit capabilities to multi-national companies. We believe this unique perspective gives our clients visibility to their business practice variations around the world and creates value for our clients by allowing them to see their data in new ways.

Increase the global adoption of contract compliance auditing, which has demonstrated value across many industries and regions
Contract compliance auditing, a specific type of recovery auditing that is more heavily utilized by commercial clients, continues to be a growing part of our business. This service offering focuses on auditing complex supplier billings against large complex contracts and is relevant to a large portion of our client base. In additional to reviewing supplier contracts to ensure compliance and identify opportunities for cash recovery, a contract compliance audit identifies the source of issues, such as ambiguity in contract language, to identify improvements for future contract negotiations and contract quality. This type of audit is important to global corporations not only because any monies recovered increase profits, but also because these audits improve the discipline of future contracting and reduce future lost profits. Conducting contract compliance audits also deters fraud.
Many of the same types of companies we work with for our accounts payable recovery audits are ideal fits for contract compliance audits - those with highly complex procurement processes, involvement with many suppliers, and complex supply chains. We believe contract compliance audits are a logical extension of the services we provide to our accounts payable recovery audit clients, have the potential to provide enormous value to our clients, both retail and commercial, and are an attractive market opportunity for us.
Expand our clients’ use of advanced analytics to improve their S2P business processes
We will continue to offer additional services that complement our recovery audit services and provide increased value to our customers.
Our advanced analytics offerings target client functional and process areas where we have established expertise, enabling us to provide services to support our clients' finance, merchandising and procurement functions. These services can be project-based (advisory services), which are typically billed on a rates and hours basis, or subscription-based (typically SaaS offerings), which are billed on a monthly basis. The advanced analytics offerings assist our clients in improving many aspects of their

businesses, including increased working capital, optimization of purchasing leverage in vendor pricing negotiations, improved insight into product margin and cost of goods for resale, identification and management of risks associated with vendor compliance, improved quality of vendor master data and improved visibility and diagnostics of direct and indirect spend.

Technology
The PRGX Verigon™ Solution Suite is an ecosystem of foundational technology infrastructure, platforms and solutions focused on our recovery audit and advanced analytics service offerings. The suite includes advanced and proprietary solutions, systems and processes and incorporates a large-scale technology infrastructure to support our broad range of audit and advanced analytics solutions.
Foundational to the Verigon Solution Suite is the Epiphany™ Data Foundation, which provides the ability to efficiently and cost effectively ingest, prepare, and transform large volumes of structured and unstructured data. We believe we have developed the most sophisticated and highest performing large data processing infrastructure system in the recovery audit industry. This system is critical to providing best-in-class recovery audit and advanced S2P analytics services. This system utilizes queue-driven data pipelines and in-memory processing to manage our clients' data in large scale volumes at superior speeds. We are continuing to accelerate data processing speeds for both structured and unstructured data sets. This allows us to support our efforts to accelerate audit results, deliver preventative and pre-payment audit capabilities, and transform our core audit processes.
We believe that our proprietary technology and processes serve as important competitive advantages over both our principal competitors and our clients’ internal recovery audit functions. To sustain these competitive advantages, we continually invest in technology initiatives to deliver innovative solutions that improve both the effectiveness and efficiency of our services.
We design our data acquisition, data processing and data management solutions to maximize efficiencies and productivity - all while maintaining the highest standards of transaction auditing and spend analytics accuracy. Further, we uphold highly reliable security standards utilizing the most sophisticated and effective tools to protect all data under our control. 
Our technology professionals clean and map massive volumes of structured and unstructured client data into standardized layouts and formats, and generate statistical reports to verify the completeness and accuracy of the data. We utilize high performance database and storage technologies to maintain the data at one of our secure data processing facilities.
The Panoptic™ Compliance Audit Platform provides our auditors with a configurable toolkit for tailoring the audit, project and claims management processes for all clients and audit types we serve. The platform processes the data using proprietary algorithms (business rules) leveraging our experience to help uncover patterns or potential issues in our clients’ various transactional streams. We deliver this processed data to our auditors who, using our proprietary audit software, sort, filter and search the data to validate and identify actual transaction errors. We maintain a secure database of audit information with the ability to query on multiple variables, including claim categories, industry codes, vendors and audit years. This allows us to identify additional recovery opportunities and provide recommendations for process improvements to our clients.
Once we identify and validate transaction errors, we present the information to our clients for approval and submission to vendors as “claims.” We offer a proprietary web-based claim presentation and collaboration solution to help our clients view, approve, and submit claims to vendors.
The third layer of our Verigon Solution Suite is Lumen™ Advanced Analytics, a combination of technology and applied data science methodologies used to derive actionable insights from the S2P data now explorable within the Epiphany Data Foundation. Our advanced analytics include our supplier information management (“SIM”) and deduction management solutions.

Competition
Accounts Payable Recovery Audit Services
We believe that the principal providers of domestic and international accounts payable recovery audit services in major markets worldwide consist of PRGX, two substantial competitors, and numerous other smaller competitors. The smaller recovery audit firms generally do not possess multi-country service capabilities and advanced technology infrastructure necessary to support our clients' large and complex purchasing and accounts payable operations. In addition, many of these firms have limited resources and may lack the experience and knowledge of complex promotions, seasonal allowances and current recovery audit practices. As a result, we believe that compared to most other firms providing accounts payable recovery audit services, PRGX has competitive advantages based on its domestic and international presence, well-trained and experienced professionals, and advanced technology.
While we believe that PRGX has the greatest depth and breadth of audit expertise, data and technology capabilities, scale and global presence in the industry, we face competition from the following:
Client Internal Recovery Audit Departments. A number of large retailers (particularly those in the discount, grocery and pharmacy sectors) have developed an internal recovery audit process to review transactions prior to turning them over to external recovery audit firms. The scale and scope of these client internal organizations varies by client based on their level of in-house expertise and investment in required tools and technologies. Regardless of the level of recoveries made by internal recovery audit departments, virtually all large retail clients retain at least one (primary), and frequently two (primary and secondary), external recovery audit firms to capture errors not identified by their internal recovery audit departments.
Other Accounts Payable Recovery Audit Firms. The competitive landscape in the recovery audit industry is comprised of:

• | Full-service accounts payable recovery audit firms. We believe that only two companies other than PRGX offer a full suite of U.S. and international recovery audit services;


• | A large number of smaller accounts payable recovery audit firms which have a limited client base, and which use less sophisticated tools to mine disbursement claim categories at low contingency rates. These firms are most common in the U.S. and UK markets. Competition in most international markets, if any, typically comes from small niche providers;


• | Firms, including one of our two substantial competitors, that offer a hybrid of audit software tools and training for use by internal audit departments, or general accounts payable process improvement enablers; and


• | Firms with specialized skills focused on recovery audit services for discrete sectors such as sales and use tax, telecom, freight or real estate.

Other Providers of Recovery Audit Services. The major international accounting firms provide recovery audit services; however, we believe their practices tend to be primarily focused on tax-related services.
Adjacent Services
Our Adjacent Services business faces competition from global and regional consulting firms, as well as some software vendors, including ERP and point-solution providers, such as procurement-specific software and specialized SaaS analytics providers. These competitors generally compete on the basis of the breadth of services, market reputations and integration with other services. Since we provide our Adjacent Services to our recovery audit clients, we believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our in-depth knowledge of our clients’ data, systems, and purchasing processes, along with advanced and specialized technology tools.
 Hiring, Training and Compensation of Personnel
Many of our auditors and other professionals formerly held finance-related management positions in the industries we serve. Training primarily is provided in the field by our experienced professionals enabling newly hired personnel to develop and refine their skills and improve productivity. We also use various other training materials such as process manuals and documented policies and procedures to supplement the field training provided by our experienced professionals. We periodically upgrade our training programs based on feedback from auditors and changing industry protocols. Many of our professionals participate in one of our incentive compensation plans that link their compensation to the financial performance of their service offering(s).

Proprietary Rights
From time to time, we develop new software and methodologies that replace or enhance existing proprietary software and methodologies. We rely primarily on trade secret and copyright protection for our proprietary software and other proprietary information. We capitalize the costs incurred for the development of computer software that will be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed or that will be used in our operations beginning when technological feasibility has been established. We consider the costs associated with developing or replacing methodologies to be development costs. 
We own or have rights to various trademarks, trade names and copyrights, including U.S. and foreign registered trademarks and trade names and U.S. registered copyrights, that are valuable assets and important to our business. We monitor the status of our copyright and trademark registrations to maintain them in force and renew them as appropriate. The duration of our active trademark registrations varies based upon the relevant statutes in the applicable jurisdiction, but generally endure for as long as they are used. The duration of our active copyright registrations similarly varies based on the relevant statutes in the applicable jurisdiction, but generally endure for the full statutory period. Our trademarks and trade names are of significant importance and include, but are not limited to, the following: PRGX®, Epiphany Data Foundation™, GET™, Lavante®, Lavante SIM™, Lumen™, Panoptic™, PRGX OPTIX®, PRGX MailTrax™, PRGX APTrax™, PRGX AuditTrax™, PRGX ClaimTrax™, and Verigon™.
Regulation
Various aspects of our business, including, without limitation, our data flows and our data acquisition, processing and reporting protocols, are subject to extensive and frequently changing governmental regulation in the U.S. and the numerous other countries around the world where we operate. These regulations include extensive data protection and privacy requirements. In the U.S., we are subject to the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) with respect to information regarding our employees, as well as our discontinued HCRA business, and subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, with respect to personal data of California consumers, households, and employees. Internationally, we must comply with the European data protection requirements, including the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which went into effect in May 2018, and as a result of Brexit, the Data Protection Act of 2018 and The Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, which substantially implements GDPR in U.K. domestic legislation. We must also comply with data protection laws that exist in many of the other countries where we serve clients. Failure to comply with such regulations may, depending on the nature of the noncompliance, result in the termination or loss of contracts, the imposition of contractual damages, civil sanctions, and damage to our reputation or in certain circumstances, criminal penalties.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, PRGX had approximately 1,500 employees, of whom approximately 600 were in the U.S. The majority of our employees are involved in our recovery audit business. 
Website
