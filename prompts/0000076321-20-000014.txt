Recent Developments
Stockholder Approval of Stock Splits Transaction and Delisting of our Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange
On January 9, 2020, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). At the Special Meeting, the holders of a majority of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote approved amendments to the Company’s certificate of incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), to effect a reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”), followed immediately by a forward stock split of the Company’s common stock (the “Forward Stock Split,” and together with the Reverse Stock Split, the “Stock Splits”), at a ratio (i) not less than 1-for-5 and not greater than 1-for-100, in the case of the Reverse Stock Split, and (ii) not less than 5-for-1 and not greater than 100-for-1, in the case of the Forward Stock Split. If the Stock Splits are effectuated, then as a result of the Stock Splits, a stockholder owning immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split fewer than a minimum number of shares, which, depending on the stock split ratios chosen by the Board, would be between 5 and 100, would be paid $30.00, without interest, for each share of common stock held by such holder immediately prior to the effective time. Cashed out stockholders would no longer be stockholders of the Company. On January 29, 2019, in connection with the anticipated Stock Splits, the Company filed a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to voluntarily delist its common stock from trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and to deregister its common stock under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The delisting occurred ten calendar days after the filing of the Form 25 so that trading was suspended on February 10, 2020, prior to the market opening. Following the delisting, the Company’s Board has continued to evaluate updated ownership data to ascertain the aggregate costs within the ranges of stock split ratios that the Company’s stockholders approved at the Special Meeting. Based upon this analysis, the Board will continue to consider the appropriate ratio to effectuate the Stock Splits. As previously disclosed, the Board, at its sole discretion, may elect to abandon the Stock Splits and the overall deregistration process for any reason, including if it determines that effectuating the Stock Splits would be too costly. Assuming the Board determines to proceed with the Stock Splits and the overall deregistration process, the Company will file with the State of Delaware certificates of amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effectuate the Stock Splits. Following the effectiveness of the Stock Splits, the Company will file a Form 15 with the SEC certifying that it has less than 300 stockholders, which will terminate the registration of the Company’s common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. As a result, the Company would cease to file annual, quarterly, current, and other reports and documents with the SEC, and stockholders will cease to receive annual reports and proxy statements. Even if the Company effectuates the Stock Splits and terminates its registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, the Company intends to continue to prepare audited annual and unaudited quarterly financial statements and to make such information available to its stockholders on a voluntary basis. However, the Company would not be required to do so by law and there is no assurance that even if the Company did make such information available that it would continue to do so in the future.
Change in Chief Executive Officer
On July 11, 2019, Gary Rich, the Company’s former President and Chief Executive Officer, entered into a transition and separation agreement (the “Separation Agreement”) with the Company and Parker Drilling Management Services Ltd. In accordance with the Separation Agreement, on December 31, 2019, Mr. Rich retired from his positions of President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and resigned from the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). The Separation Agreement was amended on February 21, 2020. Pursuant to the amended Separation Agreement, two-thirds of Mr. Rich’s outstanding restricted stock options and outstanding restricted stock units were forfeited, while on February 21, 2020, the remaining one-third of the 
restricted stock options fully vested, one‑half of the remaining restricted stock units vested and one‑half of the remaining restricted stock units were paid as cash.
As the Company searches for a Chief Executive Officer to replace Mr. Rich, the Board has established the Office of the Chief Executive Officer Committee to perform the executive functions and responsibilities formerly performed by Mr. Rich. Mr. Eugene Davis, the Company’s Chairman of the Board, was appointed to serve as the Chair of the Office of the Chief Executive Officer Committee and, in such capacity, has been designated by the Board as the Company’s principal executive officer. 
Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11
Overview
On December 12, 2018, prior to the commencement of the voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) (the “Chapter 11 Cases”), Parker Drilling and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) entered into a restructuring support agreement (as amended on January 28, 2019, the “RSA”) with certain significant holders of (1) 7.50% Senior Notes, due 2020 (the “7.50% Note Holders”) issued pursuant to the indenture (the “7.50% Notes Indenture”) dated July 30, 2013 (the “7.50% Notes”), by and among Parker Drilling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”), (2) 6.75% Senior Notes, due 2022 (the “6.75% Note Holders”) issued pursuant to the indenture (the “6.75% Notes Indenture”) dated January 22, 2014 (the “6.75% Notes” and together with the 7.50% Notes, the “Senior Notes”), by and among Parker Drilling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and the Trustee, (3) the Predecessor’s common stock (the “Predecessor Common Stock”) and (4) the Predecessor’s 7.25% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Predecessor Preferred Stock” and such holders to support a restructuring (the “Restructuring”).
On December 12, 2018 (the “Petition Date”), the Debtors filed a prearranged plan of reorganization (the “Plan”) and commenced the Chapter 11 Cases in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on March 7, 2019, and the Debtors emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings on March 26, 2019 (the “Plan Effective Date”). 
Fresh Start Accounting
Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting (“Fresh Start Accounting”) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 852, Reorganizations (“Topic 852”), which resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. References to “Successor” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company as of and subsequent to March 31, 2019. References to “Predecessor” relate to the financial position of the Company prior to, and results of operations through and including, March 31, 2019. As a result of the adoption of Fresh Start Accounting and the effects of the implementation of the Plan, the Company’s consolidated financial statements of the Successor (as of and subsequent to March 31, 2019), are not comparable to its consolidated financial statements of the Predecessor.
For more information relating to Fresh Start Accounting, see Note 3 - Fresh Start Accounting in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Business Overview
Our business is comprised of two business lines: (1) rental tools services and (2) drilling services. We report our rental tools services business as two reportable segments: (1) U.S. rental tools and (2) International rental tools. We report our drilling services business as two reportable segments: (1) U.S. (lower 48) drilling and (2) International & Alaska drilling. For information regarding our reportable segments and operations by geographic areas, see Note 17 - Reportable Segments in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Rental Tools Services Business
In our rental tools services business, we provide premium rental equipment and services to exploration & production companies, drilling contractors, and service companies on land and offshore in the U.S. and select international markets. Tools we provide include standard and heavy-weight drill pipe, all of which are available with standard or high-torque connections, tubing, drill collars, pressure control equipment, including blowout preventers, and more. We also provide well construction services, which includes tubular running services and downhole tool rentals, well intervention services, which includes whipstocks, fishing, and related services, as well as inspection and machine shop support. Rental tools are used during drilling and/or workover programs and are requested by the customer as needed, requiring us to keep a broad inventory of rental tools in stock. Rental tools are usually rented on a daily or monthly basis. 
    U.S. Rental Tools
Our U.S. rental tools segment maintains an inventory of rental tools for deepwater drilling, completion, workover, and production applications at facilities in Louisiana, Texas, Wyoming, North Dakota, and West Virginia. We also provide well construction and well intervention services. Our largest single market for rental tools is U.S. land drilling, a cyclical market driven primarily by oil and natural gas prices and our customers’ access to project financing. A portion of our U.S. rental tools business supplies tubular goods and other equipment to offshore Gulf of Mexico (“GOM”) customers. 
    International Rental Tools
Our International rental tools segment maintains an inventory of rental tools and provides well construction, well intervention, and surface and tubular services to our customers in the Middle East, Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions. 
 Drilling Services Business
In our drilling services business, we drill oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells for customers globally. We provide this service with both Company-owned rigs and customer-owned rigs. We refer to the provision of drilling services with customer-owned rigs as our operations and management (“O&M”) service in which our customers own their drilling rigs, but choose Parker to operate and manage the rigs for them. The nature and scope of activities involved in drilling a well is similar whether it is drilled with a Company-owned rig (as part of a traditional drilling contract) or a customer-owned rig (as part of an O&M contract). In addition, we provide project-related services, such as engineering, procurement, project management, commissioning of customer-owned drilling rig projects, operations execution, and quality and safety management. We have extensive experience and expertise in drilling geologically challenging wells and in managing the logistical and technological challenges of operating in remote, harsh, and ecologically sensitive areas.
U.S. (lower 48) Drilling
Our U.S. (lower 48) drilling segment provides drilling services with our GOM barge drilling rig fleet and markets our U.S. (lower 48) based O&M services. We also provide O&M services for a customer-owned rig offshore California. Our GOM barge rigs drill for oil and natural gas in shallow waters in and along the inland waterways and coasts of Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas. The majority of these wells are drilled in shallow water depths ranging from 6 to 12 feet. Our rigs are suitable for a variety of drilling programs, from inland coastal waters requiring shallow draft barges, to open water drilling in both state and federal waters. Contract terms typically consist of well-to-well or multi-well programs, most commonly ranging from 20 to 180 days.
International & Alaska Drilling
Our International & Alaska drilling segment provides drilling services, using both Company-owned rigs and O&M contracts, and project-related services. The drilling markets in which this segment operates have one or more of the following characteristics:

• | customers typically are major, independent, or national oil and natural gas companies or integrated service providers;


• | drilling programs in remote locations with little infrastructure, requiring a large inventory of spare parts and other ancillary equipment and self-supported service capabilities;


• | complex wells and/or harsh environments (such as high pressures, deep depths, hazardous or geologically challenging conditions and sensitive environments) requiring specialized equipment and considerable experience to drill; and


• | O&M contracts that generally cover periods of one year or more.

We have rigs under contract in Alaska, Kazakhstan, the Kurdistan region of Iraq, Guatemala, Mexico, and on Sakhalin Island, Russia. In addition, we have O&M and ongoing project-related services for customer-owned rigs in Alaska, Kuwait, Canada, Indonesia, and on Sakhalin Island, Russia.
Our Business Strategy
We intend to successfully compete in select energy service businesses that benefit our customers’ exploration, appraisal, and development programs, and in which operational execution is the key measure of success. We plan to do this by:

• | Consistently delivering innovative, reliable, and efficient results that help our customers reduce their operational risks and manage their operating costs; and


• | Over the longer-term, investing to improve and grow our existing business lines and to expand the scope of products and services we offer, both organically and through acquisitions.

Customers and Scope of Operations
Our customer base consists of major, independent, national oil and natural gas E&P companies, and other oil field service providers. Each of our segments depends on a limited number of key customers and the loss of any one or more key customers could have a material adverse effect on a segment. In 2019, our largest customer, Exxon Neftegas Limited (“ENL”), accounted for approximately 29.3 percent and 31.2 percent of our total consolidated revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively. For information regarding our reportable segments and operations by geographic areas, see Note 17 - Reportable Segments in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Competition 
We operate in competitive businesses characterized by high capital requirements, rigorous technological challenges, evolving regulatory requirements, and challenges in securing and retaining qualified field personnel.
In drilling markets, most contracts are awarded on a competitive bidding basis and operators often consider reliability, efficiency, and safety in addition to price. We have been successful in differentiating ourselves from competitors through our drilling performance and safety record, and through providing services that help our customers manage their operating costs and mitigate their operational risks.
In international drilling markets, we compete with a number of international drilling contractors as well as local contractors. Although local drilling contractors often have lower labor and mobilization costs, we are generally able to distinguish ourselves from these companies based on our technical expertise, safety performance, quality of service, and experience. We believe our expertise in operating in challenging environments has been a significant factor in securing contracts. 
In the GOM barge drilling market, we compete with a small number of contractors. We have the largest number and greatest diversity of rigs available in this market, allowing us to provide equipment and services that are well-matched to customers’ requirements. We believe the market for drilling contracts will continue to be competitive with continued focus on reliability, efficiency, and safety, in addition to price.
In rental tools markets, we compete with both large and small suppliers. We compete against other rental tool companies based on breadth of inventory, availability of product, quality of product and service, as well as price. In the U.S. market, our network of locations provides broad and efficient product availability for our customers. In international markets, some of our rental tools business is obtained in conjunction with our drilling and O&M projects.
Contracts
Most drilling contracts are awarded based on competitive bidding. The rates specified in drilling contracts vary depending upon the type of rig employed, equipment and services supplied, crew complement, geographic location, term of the contract, competitive conditions, and other variables. Our contracts generally provide for an operating dayrate during drilling operations, with lower rates for periods of equipment downtime, customer stoppage, well-to-well rig moves, adverse weather, or other conditions, and no payment when certain conditions continue beyond contractually established parameters. Contracts typically provide for a different dayrate or specified fixed payments during mobilization or demobilization. The terms of most of our contracts are based on either a specified period of time or a specified number of wells. The contract term in some instances may be extended by the customer exercising options for an additional time period or for the drilling of additional wells, or by exercising a right of first refusal. Most of our contracts allow termination by the customer prior to the end of the term without penalty under certain circumstances, such as the loss of or major damage to the drilling unit or other events that cause the suspension of drilling operations beyond a specified period of time. See “Certain of our contracts are subject to cancellation by our customers without penalty and with little or no notice” in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Certain contracts require the customer to pay an early termination fee if the customer terminates a contract before the end of the term without cause. Our project services contracts include engineering, procurement, and project management consulting, for which we are compensated through labor rates and cost-plus arrangements for non-labor items.
Rental tool contracts are typically on a dayrate basis with rates based on type of equipment and competitive conditions. Depending on market and competitive conditions, rental rates may be applied from the time the equipment leaves our facility or only when the equipment is actually in use by the customer. Rental contracts generally require the customer to pay for lost-in-hole or damaged equipment. Some of the services provided in the rental tools segment are billed per well section with pricing determined by the length and diameter of the well section. In addition, some tools, such as whipstocks, are sold to the customer.
Seasonality
Our rigs in the inland waters of the GOM are subject to severe weather during certain periods of the year, particularly during hurricane season from June through November, which could halt operations for prolonged periods or limit contract opportunities during that period. In addition, mobilization, demobilization, or well-to-well movements of rigs in arctic regions can be affected by seasonal changes in weather or weather so severe that conditions are deemed too unsafe to operate.
Backlog
Backlog is our estimate of the dollar amount of drilling contract revenues we expect to realize in the future as a result of executing awarded contracts. The Company’s backlog of firm orders was approximately $701.3 million as of December 31, 2019 and $243.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and is primarily attributable to the International & Alaska segment of our drilling services business. We estimate that, as of December 31, 2019, 28.3 percent of our backlog will be recognized as revenues within one year. 
The amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned could be different from amounts disclosed in our backlog calculations due to a lack of predictability of various factors, including the scope of equipment and service provided, unscheduled repairs, maintenance requirements, weather delays, contract terminations or renegotiations, new contracts, and other factors. See “Our backlog of contracted revenues may not be fully realized and may reduce significantly in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows” in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 Insurance and Indemnification
Substantially all of our operations are subject to hazards that are customary for oil and natural gas drilling operations, including blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment defects, cratering, oil and natural gas well fires and explosions, natural disasters, pollution, mechanical failure, and damage or loss during transportation. Some of our fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, either while on-site or during mobilization, such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision, damage from severe weather, and marine life infestations. These hazards could result in damage to or destruction of drilling equipment, personal injury and property damage, suspension of operations, or environmental damage, which could lead to claims by third parties or customers, suspension of operations, and contract terminations. We have had accidents in the past due to some of these hazards.
Our contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification between ourselves and our customers. We maintain insurance with respect to personal injuries, damage to or loss of equipment, and various other business risks, including well control and subsurface risk. Our insurance policies typically have 12-month policy periods.
Our insurance program provides coverage, to the extent not otherwise paid by the customer under the indemnification provisions of the drilling or rental tool contract, for liability due to well control events and liability arising from third-party claims, including wrongful death and other personal injury claims by our personnel as well as claims brought on behalf of individuals who are not our employees. Generally, our insurance program provides liability coverage up to $350.0 million, with retentions of $1.0 million or less.
Well control events generally include an unintended flow from the well that cannot be contained by using equipment on site (e.g., a blowout preventer), by increasing the weight of drilling fluid or by diverting the fluids safely into production. Our insurance program provides coverage for third-party liability claims relating to sudden and accidental pollution from a well control event up to $350.0 million per occurrence. A separate limit of $50.0 million exists to cover the costs of re-drilling of the well and well control costs under a Contingent Operators Extra Expense policy. For our rig-based operations, remediation plans are in place to prevent the spread of pollutants and our insurance program provides coverage for removal, response, and remedial actions. We retain the risk for liability not indemnified by the customer below the retention and in excess of our insurance coverage.
Based upon a risk assessment and due to the high cost, high self-insured retention, and limited availability of coverage for windstorms in the GOM, we have elected not to purchase windstorm insurance for our barge rigs in the GOM. Although we have retained the risk for physical loss or damage for these rigs arising from a named windstorm, we have procured insurance coverage for removal of a wreck caused by a windstorm.
Our contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification from our customers and may require us to indemnify our customers in certain circumstances. Liability with respect to personnel and property is customarily assigned on a “knock-for-knock” basis, which means we and our customers customarily assume liability for our respective personnel and property regardless of fault. In addition, our customers typically indemnify us for damage to our equipment down-hole, and in some cases, our subsea equipment, generally based on replacement cost minus some level of depreciation. However, in certain contracts we may assume liability for damage to our customer’s property and other third-party property on the rig and in other contracts we are not indemnified by our customers for damage to their property and, accordingly, could be liable for any such damage under applicable law. 
Our customers typically assume responsibility for and indemnify us from any loss or liability resulting from pollution, including clean-up and removal and third-party damages, arising from operations under the contract and originating below the surface of the land or water, including losses or liability resulting from blowouts or cratering of the well. In some contracts, however, we may have liability for damages resulting from such pollution or contamination caused by our gross negligence or, in some cases, ordinary negligence.
We generally indemnify the customer for legal and financial consequences of spills of industrial waste, lubricants, solvents and other contaminants (other than drilling fluid) on the surface of the land or water originating from our rigs or equipment. We typically require our customers to retain liability for spills of drilling fluid which circulates down-hole to the drill bit, lubricates the bit and washes debris back to the surface. Drilling fluid often contains a mixture of synthetics, the exact composition of which is prescribed by the customer based on the particular geology of the well being drilled.
The above description of our insurance program and the indemnification provisions typically found in our contracts is only a summary as of the date hereof and is general in nature. Our insurance program and the terms of our drilling and rental tool contracts may change in the future. In addition, the indemnification provisions of our contracts may be subject to differing interpretations, and enforcement of those provisions may be limited by public policy and other considerations.
If any of the aforementioned operating hazards results in substantial liability and our insurance and contractual indemnification provisions are unavailable or insufficient, our financial condition, operating results, or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.

Environmental Considerations
Our operations are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations, as well as the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions in which we operate, pertaining to the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and state equivalents, issue regulations to implement and enforce laws pertaining to the environment, which often require costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties or may result in injunctive relief for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities; limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive, and other protected areas; require remedial action to clean up pollution from former operations; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly compliance could adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as those of similarly situated entities operating in the same markets. While our management believes that we comply with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, there is no assurance that compliance can be maintained in the future.
As an owner or operator of both onshore and offshore facilities, including mobile offshore drilling rigs in or near waters of the United States, we may be liable for the costs of clean up and damages arising out of a pollution incident to the extent set forth in federal statutes such as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”)), as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”); the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”); the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”); the Clean Air Act (“CAA”); the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”); the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (“EPCRA”); and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (“HMTA”) as well as comparable state laws. In addition, we may also be subject to civil claims arising out of any such incident.
The CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. The CWA and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges.        
The OPA and related regulations impose a variety of regulations on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of spills of oil or other hazardous substances and liability for damages resulting from such spills. “Responsible parties” include the owner or operator of a vessel, pipeline or onshore facility, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. The OPA assigns strict and joint and several liability for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages to each responsible party. The OPA also requires some facilities to demonstrate proof of financial responsibility and to prepare an oil spill response plan. Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation in a spill may subject a responsible party to civil or criminal enforcement actions.
The OCSLA authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the Outer Continental Shelf. Specific design and operational standards may apply to Outer Continental Shelf vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) regulates the design and operation of well control and other equipment at offshore production sites, implementation of safety and environmental management systems, and mandatory third-party compliance audits, among other requirements. Violations of environmentally related lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to the OCSLA can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases. Such enforcement liabilities, delay, or restriction of activities can result from either governmental or citizen prosecution.
High-profile and catastrophic events, such as the 2010 Macondo (Deepwater Horizon) well incident, have heightened governmental and environmental focus on the oil and gas industry. From time to time, legislative proposals have been introduced that would materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in certain areas. Our operations, and those of our customers, are impacted by restrictions on drilling in certain areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere, including the adoption of additional safety requirements and policies regarding the approval of drilling permits and restrictions on development and production activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
On July 28, 2016, BSEE adopted a well-control rule that will be implemented in phases over the next several years (the "2016 Well Control Rule"). This rule includes more stringent design requirements for well-control equipment used in offshore drilling operations. BSEE was directed to review the 2016 Well Control Rule pursuant to Executive Order (“EO”) 13783 (“Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth”) and Section 7 of EO 13795 (“Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy”), to determine if the rule should be revised to encourage energy exploration and production on the Outer Continental Shelf, while still providing for safe and environmentally responsible exploration and production activities. On May 2, 2019, BSEE issued a revised rule intended to reduce the regulatory burden of the 2016 Well Control Rule. We are continuing to evaluate the cost and effect that the revised rule will have on our operations.
CERCLA (also known as “Superfund”) and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the activity, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. While CERCLA exempts crude oil from the definition of hazardous substances for purposes of the statute, our operations may involve the use or handling of other materials that may be classified as hazardous substances. CERCLA assigns strict liability to a broad class of potentially responsible parties for all response and remediation costs, as well as natural resource damages. In addition, persons responsible for release of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the cost of cleaning up the hazardous substances released into the environment and for damages to natural resources.
RCRA and comparable state laws regulate the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Current RCRA regulations specifically exclude from the definition of hazardous waste “drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy.” However, these wastes and other wastes may be otherwise regulated by EPA or state agencies. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, spent solvents, laboratory wastes, and used oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste. Although the costs of managing solid and hazardous wastes may be significant and new regulations may be imposed, we do not expect to experience more burdensome costs than competitor companies involved in similar drilling operations.
The CAA and similar state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants and may also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. In addition, those laws may require us to obtain permits for the construction, modification, or operation of certain projects or facilities and the utilization of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. For example, the EPA has adopted regulations known as “RICE MACT” that require the use of “maximum achievable control technology” to reduce formaldehyde and other emissions from certain stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines, which can include portable engines used to power drilling rigs. In addition, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements. The EPA has also adopted new rules under the CAA that require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as “green completions.” These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. Further, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion in October 2015. Pursuant to an order issued by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in lawsuits brought by a coalition of states and environmental groups against the EPA for failing to complete initial area designations under the standard by the October 2017 statutory deadline, EPA completed all remaining initial area designations on July 17, 2018. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements or delay, or limit our ability or our customers’ ability to obtain permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment and decreased demand for our services.
Some scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases including carbon dioxide and methane, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” (“GHGs”), may be contributing to the warming of the atmosphere resulting in climate change. There are a variety of legislative and regulatory developments, proposals, requirements, and initiatives that have been introduced in the U.S. and international regions in which we operate that are intended to address concerns that emissions of GHGs are contributing to climate change and these may increase costs of compliance for our drilling services or our customer’s operations. Among these developments, the Kyoto Protocol to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCC”) established a set of emission targets for GHGs that became binding on all those countries that had ratified it. The Kyoto Protocol was followed by the Paris Agreement of the 2015 UNFCC. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016 and, as of late 2017, had been ratified by 174 of the 197 parties to the UNFCC. However, on August 4, 2017, the United States formally communicated to the United Nations its intent to withdraw from participation in the Paris Agreement, which entails a four-year process and will be complete by November 2020. In response to the announced withdrawal plan, a number of state and local governments in the United States have expressed intentions to take GHG-related actions.
Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas or otherwise result in reduced economic activity generally. In addition, such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which may have a negative impact on our business. In addition to potential impacts on our business directly or indirectly resulting from climate-change legislation or regulations, our business also could be negatively affected by climate-change related physical changes or changes in weather patterns. An increase in severe weather patterns could result in damages to or loss of our rigs, impact our ability to conduct our operations, and result in a disruption of our customers’ operations.
Hydraulic fracturing is a process sometimes used in the completion of oil and natural gas wells whereby water, other liquids, sand, and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate natural gas and, oil production. Various governmental entities (within and outside the United States) are in the process of studying, restricting, regulating, or preparing to regulate hydraulic fracturing, directly and indirectly. Many state governments require the disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process and, due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, including on groundwater quality and seismic activity, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some state and local jurisdictions have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether. We do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities. However, these and other developments could cause operational delays or increased costs in exploration and production, which could adversely affect the demand for our products or services.
The federal ESA was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We may conduct operations on natural gas and oil leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered may exist. On February 11, 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) published a final policy which alters how it may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival 
of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions and may materially delay or prohibit land access for natural gas and oil development. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our customer’s exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on their ability to develop and produce reserves. If our customers were to have a portion of their leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services.
Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations related to workplace safety and worker health, primarily the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder. In addition, various other governmental and quasi-governmental agencies require us to obtain certain miscellaneous permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. The kind of permits, licenses and certificates required by our operations depend upon a number of factors. We believe we have the necessary permits, licenses and certificates that are material to the conduct of our existing business.
