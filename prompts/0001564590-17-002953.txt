Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel targeted therapeutics for cancer, wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, and fibrotic diseases. We are a leader in the field of endoglin biology and are using our expertise to develop antibodies that bind to the endoglin receptor. Endoglin is essential to angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation required for solid cancer growth and for wet AMD, and a key contributor to the development of fibrosis, or tissue scarring. We are developing our lead product candidate, TRC105 (INN carotuximab), an endoglin antibody, for the treatment of multiple solid tumor types in combination with inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, pathway. The VEGF pathway regulates vascular development in the embryo, or vasculogenesis, and angiogenesis. We believe treatment with TRC105 in combination with VEGF inhibitors may improve survival in cancer patients when compared to treatment with a VEGF inhibitor alone.  TRC105 has been studied in eight completed Phase 2 clinical trials and three completed Phase 1 clinical trials, and is currently being dosed in one Phase 3 clinical trial, four Phase 2 clinical trials and three Phase 1 clinical trials. Our TRC105 oncology clinical development plan is broad and involves a tiered approach. We are initially focused on two indications, angiosarcoma and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, or GTN, both of which are tumors that highly express endoglin, the target of TRC105, and therefore may be more responsive to treatment with TRC105. We have seen complete ongoing responses in these tumor types and have initiated dosing in an international multicenter Phase 3 trial in angiosarcoma and an international multicenter Phase 2 trial in GTN. We obtained 
 3

Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on our clinical trial design for the Phase 3 trial in angiosarcoma and also incorporated scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regarding the adequacy of the trial design.  We also received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the EMA for TRC105 for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, including angiosarcoma, in 2016.
 The next tier of TRC105 development includes ongoing Phase 2 trials in renal cell carcinoma, which is a randomized trial expected to produce top-line data in the second half of 2017, and hepatocellular carcinoma, that is expected to produce top-line data in the first half of 2018.  Positive data from either of these Phase 2 trials could enable Phase 3 development. We consider these indications attractive because the endpoints for regulatory approval may be attained more quickly than the endpoints for other indications. We also expect that these initial indications would be for the same lines of treatment for which the companion VEGF inhibitor is approved. 
 Finally, the third tier of TRC105 development includes large indications including an ongoing Phase 1 trial in lung cancer and a Phase 1/2 trial in breast cancer. Positive data in these larger indications would enable further development.
 
We have produced a formulation of TRC105 for development in ophthalmology, which is being developed for the treatment of wet AMD, the leading cause of blindness in the Western world. In March 2014, Santen licensed from us exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize our endoglin antibodies, including TRC105, for ophthalmology indications. We retain global rights to develop our endoglin antibodies outside of the field of ophthalmology. In June 2015, Santen filed an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application with the FDA for the initiation of clinical studies for DE‐122, the ophthalmic formulation of TRC105, in patients with wet AMD.  The Phase 1/2 PAVE trial is recruiting patients with wet AMD, including patients receiving a VEGF inhibitor, and top-line data are expected in the second half of 2017. We also expect Santen to initiate the Phase 2 AVANTE trial in wet AMD in 2017. 
 
TRC205, a humanized, deimmunized endoglin antibody, is being developed for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. Diseases characterized by fibrosis, the harmful buildup of excessive fibrous tissue from cells, including the fibroblast, that leads to scarring and ultimately organ failure, include nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, renal fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis and scleroderma. Clinical data have demonstrated increased endoglin expression on fibroblasts in patients with heart failure and inhibiting endoglin reduced cardiac fibrosis, preserved heart function and improved survival in mouse models of heart failure. Subsequent preclinical research in mouse models indicated that antibodies to endoglin inhibit cardiac, liver, and pulmonary fibrosis. These findings indicate endoglin’s importance in cardiac, lung and liver fibrosis, and we believe these findings may be applicable to multiple fibrotic diseases, including NASH, IPF, myelofibrosis and other indications. In addition, a patient with cutaneous neurofibromatosis treated with TRC105 and a VEGF inhibitor in an oncology trial demonstrated reduction in the cutaneous lesions that characterize the disease. We may study TRC105 in additional patients with cutaneous neurofibromatosis.
 Our second clinical stage product oncology candidate is TRC102, a small molecule being developed for the treatment of mesothelioma, lung cancer and glioblastoma. TRC102 is in clinical development to reverse resistance to specific chemotherapeutics by inhibiting base‑excision repair, or BER. In initial clinical trials of more than 100 patients, TRC102 has shown good tolerability and promising anti-tumor activity in combination with alkylating and antimetabolite chemotherapy, including agents approved for the treatment of lung cancer and glioblastoma. TRC102 is being studied in Phase 2 trials with Temodar (temozolomide) in glioblastoma and with Alimta (pemetrexed) in mesothelioma, in addition to three ongoing Phase 1 trials.
 
We are also developing TRC253 and TRC694, small molecule compounds we licensed from Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. (Janssen) in September 2016. TRC253 is a novel small molecule high affinity competitive inhibitor of wild type androgen receptor (AR) and multiple AR mutant receptors which display drug resistance to currently approved treatments, and is intended for the treatment of men with prostate cancer. We filed an IND in December 2016, which was cleared by the FDA in January 2017, and expect to initiate first in human testing for TRC253 in a Phase 1/2 clinical study in the first half of 2017. Until 90 days after we complete the initial Phase 1/2 study, Janssen has an exclusive option to reacquire full rights to TRC253 for an upfront payment of $45.0 million to us, and obligations to make regulatory and commercialization milestone payments totaling up to $137.5 million upon achievement of specified events and a low single-digit royalty. If Janssen does not exercise its exclusive option to reacquire the program, we would then retain worldwide development and commercialization rights to the program, in which case we would be obligated to pay Janssen a total of up to $45.0 million in development and regulatory milestones upon achievement of specified events, in addition to a low single digit royalty.
 
TRC694 is a novel, potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of NF-kB inducing kinase (NIK), which is intended for the treatment of patients with hematologic malignancies, including myeloma. We plan to conduct preclinical activities, including formulation development and companion diagnostic development, and expect to file an IND for TRC694 in 2018.
 
We operate a product development platform that emphasizes capital efficiency. Our experienced clinical operations, data management, quality assurance and regulatory affairs groups are responsible for significant aspects of our clinical trials, including site monitoring, regulatory compliance, database management and clinical study report preparation. We use this internal resource to 
 4

minimize the costs associated with hiring contract research organizations, or CROs, to manage clinical, regulatory and database aspects of the clinical trials that we sponsor. In our experience, this model has resulted in capital efficiencies and improved communication with clinical trial sites, which expedites patient enrollment and access to patient data as compared to a CRO-managed model, and we have begun to leverage this capital efficient model in our recently initiated international clinical trials. In addition, we have an experienced chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) group that completes our product development platform.
 We have collaborated with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which has selected TRC105 and TRC102 for federal funding of clinical development, as well as Case Western Cancer Center (Case Western) and certain other academic institutions. Under these collaborations, NCI has sponsored or is sponsoring nine completed or ongoing clinical trials of TRC105 and TRC102, and Case Western has sponsored or is sponsoring three clinical trials of TRC102. We anticipate that NCI will complete ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of TRC105 and TRC102 and may initiate other clinical trials. If merited by Phase 2 data, we expect to fund additional Phase 3 clinical trials of TRC105 in certain indications beyond angiosarcoma and initial Phase 3 clinical trials of TRC102 and, based on NCI’s past course of conduct with similarly situated pharmaceutical companies in which it has sponsored pivotal clinical trials following receipt of positive Phase 2 data, we anticipate that NCI would sponsor Phase 3 clinical trials in additional indications.

Our goal is to be a leader in the development of targeted therapies for patients with cancer and other diseases of high unmet medical need. As key components of our strategy, we intend to:
 
 
• | Focus the initial tier of clinical development of TRC105 on oncology indications that highly express endoglin and have demonstrated durable complete responses to treatment, and have potential reduced time to regulatory approval. We have initiated dosing in our international multicenter randomized Phase 3 clinical trial of TRC105 in angiosarcoma, a type of soft tissue sarcoma that highly expresses endoglin, in combination with the approved VEGF inhibitor Votrient (pazopanib) versus single agent Votrient. We expect an interim analysis in the first half of 2018 that will determine the final sample size. We expect top line data in 2019. We obtained SPA agreement from the FDA on our clinical trial design for the Phase 3 trial in angiosarcoma and also incorporated scientific advice from the EMA regarding the adequacy of the trial design. The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival, or the time a patient lives without the cancer progressing, rather than overall survival. A progression-free survival primary endpoint can be achieved sooner than an overall survival endpoint, thereby reducing the time to complete the clinical trial described here and submit applications for regulatory approval. We also received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the EMA for TRC105 for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, including angiosarcoma, in 2016. We have initiated an international multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 as a single agent and in combination with Avastin (bevacizumab) in GTN with overall response as the primary endpoint, and expect topline data in the second half of 2018. In the case of GTN, response can be reliably assessed by serum β‐hCG, a known and reliable marker of disease burden, and we expect that regulatory approval would be based on overall response rate in a single arm trial.

• | Focus the second tier of clinical development of TRC105 on oncology indications that have potential reduced time to regulatory approval. We plan to continue ongoing Phase 2 development of TRC105 in combination with approved VEGF inhibitors in the oncology indications of renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, both of which are associated with reduced time to achieve the endpoints necessary for regulatory approval, with the goal of enabling one or more Phase 3 clinical trials in these indications. The FDA has granted approval for drugs in renal cell carcinoma based on a primary endpoint of progression-free survival, rather than overall survival. Although the endpoint for approval for hepatocellular carcinoma is overall survival, this endpoint is typically reached sooner for hepatocellular carcinoma than for many other solid tumors.

• | Focus the third tier of clinical development of TRC105 on large market oncology indications. To maximize the commercial opportunity of TRC105, we intend to continue developing TRC105 in additional oncology indications with

large patient populations. We initiated dosing in a Phase 1 trial of TRC105 in combination with chemotherapy and Avastin in lung cancer, and in a Phase 1/2 trial of TRC105 with Afinitor (everolimus) and Femara (letrozole) in breast cancer in 2016. We expect top-line data in lung cancer in 2017 that, if positive, could enable further development.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to leverage our collaborative relationship with NCI to accelerate and broaden development of TRC105 and TRC102. Our collaboration with NCI allows us to pursue more indications with our assets than we would otherwise be able to pursue on our own. We anticipate that NCI will complete ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of TRC105 and TRC102 and may initiate other clinical trials. If merited by Phase 2 data, we expect to fund additional Phase 3 clinical trials of TRC105 and TRC102 and, based on NCI’s past course of conduct with similarly situated pharmaceutical companies in which it has sponsored pivotal clinical trials following receipt of positive Phase 2 data, we anticipate that NCI would sponsor Phase 3 clinical trials in additional indications.

• | Support Santen during clinical development to advance DE-122 in wet AMD. We are using our expertise in the development of endoglin antibodies to assist Santen in the development of DE-122. Santen filed an IND in June 2015 for the development of DE-122, is currently enrolling wet AMD patients into the Phase 1/2 PAVE trial of DE-122 and we expect them to initiate the Phase 2 AVANTE trial of DE-122 in 2017.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue preclinical studies of endoglin antibodies in fibrotic diseases. TRC205, a humanized and deimmunized endoglin antibody, is our lead product candidate for the treatment of fibrotic diseases, including NASH and IPF, each of which presents a large commercial opportunity. We reported data for TRC205 in a preclinical model of NASH in 2016, and plan to report additional preclinical studies of our endoglin antibodies in 2017. We also may study TRC105 in patients with cutaneous neurofibromatosis.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Initiate first in human Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TRC253 in patients with prostate cancer. We filed an IND in December 2016 for TRC253, that was cleared by the FDA in January 2017, and expect to initiate dosing in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TRC253 in the first half of 2017 in castrate resistant prostate cancer patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue preclinical development of TRC694. We plan to conduct preclinical activities for TRC694 to enable filing of an IND in 2018.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage internal capabilities to advance other programs efficiently and cost effectively through our product development platform. We have assembled a management team that has contributed to the approval of seven therapeutics, including VEGF inhibitors in cancer and in wet AMD, and that has core competencies relating to clinical operations, regulatory affairs, quality assurance and CMC. We expect to continue to benefit from these capabilities through the development of additional early and mid-stage product candidates, both from internal programs and potential in-licensed programs.

Our Lead Product Candidate– TRC105
 
Rationale for Developing Endoglin Antibodies to Treat Cancer, Wet AMD and Fibrotic Diseases
 
We focus on developing antibodies that target the endoglin receptor. Endoglin is a protein that is overexpressed on endothelial cells, the cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels, when they experience hypoxia, which is a condition characterized by inadequate oxygen supply. Endoglin allows endothelial cells to proliferate in a hypoxic environment and is required for angiogenesis. These properties render endoglin an attractive target for the treatment of diseases that require angiogenesis, including solid cancers and wet AMD, especially in combination with VEGF inhibitors. Endoglin is also expressed on fibroblasts, the cells that mediate fibrosis, and is a key contributor to the development of fibrosis. Finally, endoglin is also expressed on activated macrophages.
 
We believe the endoglin pathway serves as the dominant escape pathway that allows continued angiogenesis despite inhibition of the VEGF pathway. We believe that a combination of VEGF and endoglin inhibitors may have application in wet AMD as well as a number of oncology indications where VEGF inhibitors are currently approved by regulatory authorities. Tumor types for which VEGF inhibitors have been approved include colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, renal cell carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma, ovarian cancer and thyroid cancer.
 
Anti-Angiogenesis VEGF Inhibitors in Oncology Indications
 
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the Western world and may affect any organ in the human body. Localized cancer is generally treated and cured with surgery. However, metastatic cancer that has spread beyond the location where it started is generally incurable. Metastatic cancer is treated with chemotherapeutics or targeted agents that specifically inhibit pathways implicated in tumor growth or angiogenesis.

There are several FDA-approved anti-angiogenesis drugs that inhibit the VEGF pathway, with over $10.0 billion in reported aggregate worldwide sales in oncology in 2016. VEGF inhibitors are approved in the following oncology indications, among others:
 
 
• | Soft Tissue Sarcoma, including angiosarcoma. The American Cancer Society, or the ACS, estimates there were approximately 12,000 new cases of soft tissue sarcoma in the United States in 2016 with more than 4,900 deaths. Localized tumors are curable, but patients with metastatic disease have a median survival of approximately 12 months following diagnosis. Standard systemic chemotherapy regimens are poorly tolerated and of limited usefulness with response rates of approximately 20% to 30%. Votrient, a small molecule VEGF inhibitor, was approved in the United States for the second line treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in 2013. Votrient is also approved for angiosarcoma where there are an estimated 500 cases annually in each of the United States and the European Union. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Renal Cell Carcinoma. The ACS estimates there were 62,700 new cases of renal cell carcinoma in the United States in 2016 with 14,240 deaths. Sutent (sunitinib), Nexavar (sorafenib) and Votrient are small molecule VEGF inhibitors approved as single agents for the first line treatment of advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma, Inlyta (axitinib) and Cabometyx (cabozantanib) are small molecule VEGF inhibitors approved for second line treatment, Avastin is approved with interferon. Inlyta was approved in 2012 for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, with reported global sales of $401 million in 2016, compared to $430 million in 2015. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hepatocellular Carcinoma. The ACS estimates there were 39,230 new cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States in 2016 with 27,170 deaths. The only drug approved in the United States for the first line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is the VEGF inhibitor Nexavar. In 2016, reported global sales of Nexavar were $1.0 billion worldwide. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Colorectal Cancer. The ACS estimates there were 134,490 new cases of colon cancer or rectal cancer in the United States in 2016 with 49,190 deaths. Avastin is approved with chemotherapy for the first and second line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, Cyramza (ramucirumab) is approved with chemotherapy for second line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, and Zaltrap (ziv-aflibercept) is approved with chemotherapy for the second line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Stivarga (regorafenib) is approved following prior treatment with chemotherapy and VEGF inhibitor. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. The ACS estimates there were 224,390 new cases of lung cancer in the United States in 2016 with 158,080 deaths. Avastin is approved for the first line treatment of patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, in combination with chemotherapy and Cyramza is approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
VEGF inhibitors are also used off-label in other indications, including GTN. GTN is a form of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD), a group of rare diseases that originate in the placenta and have the potential to locally invade the uterus and metastasize. The pathogenesis of GTD is unique because the maternal tumor arises from gestational rather than maternal tissue. The major histologic entities for this disease include complete molar pregnancy, partial molar pregnancy, invasive mole, and choriocarcinoma. The term GTN is used when molar and non-molar pregnancies become malignant, and comprise the morphologic entities of invasive mole and choriocarcinoma. Choriocarcinoma metastasizes hematogenously and can follow any type of pregnancy, but most commonly develops after complete hydatidiform mole. The reported incidence of GTD in the United States is about 110 to 120 per 100,000 pregnancies. The reported incidence of choriocarcinoma, the most aggressive form of GTD, in the United States is about 2 to 7 per 100,000 pregnancies.
 TRC105 Development in Oncology
 Clinical Development Overview
 
TRC105 is our investigational novel human chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody that is currently being dosed weekly or every two weeks by intravenous, or IV, infusion in clinical trials. Commercialized chimeric antibodies include Rituxan (rituximab), Erbitux (cetuximab) and Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin), which collectively had reported global sales of over $7.0 billion in 2016. 
 
Clinical trials of TRC105 as a single agent in patients whose cancer had progressed on multiple prior therapies indicated limited single agent activity in treatment-resistant patients with prostate cancer, metastatic bladder cancer, advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma and ovarian cancer. However, single agent activity, as evidenced by progression-free survival greater than 18 months or partial response, was achieved in individual treatment-resistant patients with soft tissue sarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer. VEGF levels are elevated following TRC105 treatment and the collective clinical data support the development of TRC105 in combination with VEGF inhibitors rather than development as a single agent. Initially, 
 8

TRC105 was studied in the last line treatment setting, where patients tend to be resistant to additional treatments, but ongoing development focuses on the treatment of cancer patients with TRC105 and VEGF inhibitors in the first and second line treatment settings, where increased susceptibility to anti-angiogenic treatment is expected. Additionally, TRC105 may be more effective as a single agent in tumor types, including angiosarcoma, known to overexpress endoglin.
 
TRC105 is being studied in eight ongoing clinical trials in combination with VEGF inhibitors and has been studied in 11 completed clinical trials as a single agent or with VEGF inhibitors. The following table summarizes certain key information regarding our clinical trials of TRC105 in cancer patients:

Ongoing Clinical Trials of TRC105
 
Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Votreint in Patients with Angiosarcoma
 
We have initiated dosing in a randomized multicenter international Phase 3 clinical trial of TRC105 following SPA agreement from the FDA and scientific advice from the EMA regarding the adequacy of the trial design.  The trial compares single agent Votrient, an approved VEGF inhibitor, to the combination of Votrient and TRC105, in patients with cutaneous and non-cutaneous angiosarcoma. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by RECIST 1.1 with overall survival as a secondary endpoint. The trial is designed to enroll 124 patients to provide greater than 80% power to determine an improvement in median PFS from 4.0 to 7.3 months using a two-tailed alpha of 0.05, and includes an adaptive design, whereby the conditional power 
 9

determined at the time of interim analysis may dictate an increase in the sample size to a total of 200 patients or the enrollment of 100 additional patients with cutaneous disease only. We expect the interim analysis to be completed in the first half of 2018.
 
Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Inlyta in Patients with Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
 
We are conducting a two-part multicenter international Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Inlyta, an approved VEGF inhibitor, in patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We have completed enrollment of Part 1 of the trial, which was conducted at five sites in the United States and enrolled 18 patients, and are currently enrolling patients in Part 2 of the trial.
 
Data were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2016 Congress for the updated results from the Phase 1b clinical trial combining TRC105 with Inlyta in patients with advanced or metastatic RCC. Median progression free survival (PFS) of 11.3 months was observed in all RCC patients in the study, including those patients with clear cell RCC, the most prevalent form of RCC. An objective response rate (ORR) of 29% was also seen in the trial. For comparative purposes, median PFS observed in the large subgroup of VEGFR TKI-refractory patients treated with Inlyta (n=194) in the Inlyta AXIS Phase 3 study in second line clear cell RCC patients (a separate trial) was 4.8 months and ORR was 11.3%.
 

Maximum percentage change in target lesion size in renal cell carcinoma patients
 treated with TRC105 and Inlyta
 

Based on the tolerability and anti-tumor activity observed in Part 1 of the trial, Part 2 of the trial began enrollment in November 2014 and is expected to enroll 150 advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients at approximately 50 sites in the United States and Europe to compare TRC105 in combination with Inlyta to single agent Inlyta. The patients are randomly allocated in equal numbers to the two treatment arms, and the primary endpoint of Part 2 of the trial is progression-free survival as assessed by RECIST 1.1. We expect to complete enrollment and we expect to announce top line data in the second half of 2017. 
 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Votrient in Patients with Soft Tissue Sarcoma
 
We are conducting a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Votrient, an approved VEGF inhibitor, in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Part 1 of the trial completed enrollment of 18 evaluable patients. TRC105 and Votrient demonstrated encouraging preliminary signs of activity in a highly pretreated population, including partial responses by Choi criteria in six of 18 (33%) patients, including a complete response by RECIST 1.1 that was ongoing at 129 weeks of treatment in a patient with cutaneous angiosarcoma.  
 
Based on the tolerability and anti-tumor activity observed, Part 2 of the trial began enrollment in September 2014. Part 2 of the trial completed accrual of the planned 63 patients at eight sites in the United States in November 2015, and top-line data indicate that median PFS unstratified by histology or tumor endoglin expression (3.9 months) is similar to the PFS expected for Votrient alone, based on data from the Votrient PALETTE Phase 3 trial in soft tissue sarcoma. Of the 81 patients enrolled in Parts 1 and 2 of the trial, five of the patients had angiosarcoma.  An additional group of 13 angiosarcoma patients were then enrolled, nine patients which were 
 10

treated initially with single agent TRC105 followed by the combination of TRC105 and Votrient at progression. We are currently enrolling an additional cohort of up to 13 angiosarcoma patients while our Phase 3 study is undergoing the approval process at the participating sites.
 
In November 2016, data were presented at the Connective Tissue Oncology Society (CTOS) annual meeting for the 18 angiosarcoma patients treated with either the combination of TRC105 and Votrient, or with single agent TRC105 followed by combination of TRC105 and Votrient. For the initial five angiosarcoma patients enrolled in the original Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, the median progression-free survival (mPFS) is greater than 16.6 months. For the nine chemotherapy-refractory angiosarcoma patients treated with the combination of TRC105 and Votrient, three of whom had also previously progressed on Votrient treatment (and includes the initial five patients), mPFS is 5.6 months. Three of the nine patients remain on treatment, including two patients with durable complete responses (CRs), on treatment for 23 and 30 months, respectively, as of February 28, 2017. For comparison, mPFS with single agent Votrient was 3.0 months with no CRs in a previously completed retrospective analysis of 40 chemotherapy-refractory and Votrient-naive angiosarcoma patients. An additional group of nine angiosarcoma patients was enrolled and treated initially with single agent TRC105 followed by the combination of TRC105 and Votrient at progression. The mPFS in these nine patients treated initially with single agent TRC105 was similar to the mPFS reported in late-stage trials of single agent VEGF inhibitors, including Votrient and Nexavar. Four of the nine patients remain on study with either single agent TRC105 or the combination of TRC105 and Votrient, including one patient with a partial response. TRC105 administered at its recommended Phase 2 dose of 10 mg/kg weekly was well-tolerated in combination with Votrient at its approved dose, which allowed for prolonged dosing without an increase in the frequency or severity of adverse events typical of each individual drug. 
 

Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with or without Avastin in Patients with GTN, including Choriocarcinoma
 
We initiated a Phase 2 multicenter international clinical trial that employs a sequential treatment design in 2016, whereby patients will receive initially TRC105 as a single agent, and will also have the opportunity to receive TRC105 in combination with Avastin if they do not respond to single agent TRC105. The trial is designed to enroll 30 patients with GTN, including choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT). Patients will be enrolled who are refractory to at least one prior multiagent chemotherapeutic regimen and the primary endpoint will be overall response rate as assessed by β-hCG for choriocarcinoma and by a combination of β-hCG and RECIST 1.1 for PSTT and ETT. We expect that positive data from this trial could be registration enabling. We expect top line data in the second half of 2018.
 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Nexavar in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma
 
NCI is conducting a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Nexavar, an approved VEGF inhibitor, in up to 42 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Part 1 of the trial was completed following the enrollment of 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 15 of which were evaluable by RECIST 1.1, and Part 2 of the trial was initiated in the third quarter of 2014 and is expected to enroll up to 23 patients. Part 1 of the trial was designed as an ascending dose trial with an expansion stage with the primary endpoint of evaluating the safety and tolerability of 3, 6, 10 and 15 mg/kg TRC105 every two weeks in combination with the approved dose of Nexavar to select a dose level of TRC105 (in combination with Nexavar) for further study if merited. Data reported at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in June 2015 indicated that TRC105 was well tolerated at all doses tested (3, 6, 10 and 15 mg/kg) in combination with approved doses of Nexavar. As shown in the figure below, anti-tumor activity was noted, including reductions in tumor burden in the majority of treated patients, and partial response by RECIST 1.1 in four of the ten patients (40%) with measurable disease treated at the highest two dose levels of TRC105 (10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg dosed 
 11

once every two weeks). This response rate exceeded the response rate reported for Nexavar in its pivotal Phase 3 trial of 2%, as assessed by RECIST 1.1. The primary endpoint of Part 2 of the trial is overall response rate as assessed by RECIST 1.1.  We expect the NCI to publish trial results in a peer reviewed journal in 2017.
 
Maximum percentage change in target lesion size in
 hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with TRC105 and Nexavar
 


Based on these data, we initiated dosing in a multicenter Phase 2 study of TRC105 in hepatocellular carcinoma in 2016, as described below.
 
Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Nexavar in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma
 
We initiated dosing in a Phase 1/ 2 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Nexavar, which is approved for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, in patients with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma in 2016. Prior completed clinical trials indicate that 10 mg/kg of TRC105 given weekly for four doses and then given every other week at 15 mg/kg is well tolerated with Votrient or with Inlyta, and Part 1 of the trial will determine whether this dose and schedule of TRC105 can be administered safely concurrently with Nexavar. Part 2 of the trial is expected to enroll up to 21 patients with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma to determine the overall response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival following treatment with the recommended Phase 2 dose of TRC105 determined from Part 1 of the trial given concurrently with Nexavar. We expect to have top line data in the first half of 2018.
Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Afinitor and Femara in Postmenopausal Women with Newly Diagnosed Local or Locally Advanced Potentially Resectable Hormone-Receptor Positive and Her-2 Negative Breast Cancer
 
The University of Alabama, Birmingham Cancer Center, or UAB, is conducting a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 as a neoadjuvant in combination with Afinitor and Femara, each of which is approved for the treatment of breast cancer. The trial is enrolling patients with locally advanced breast cancer who will receive TRC105 in combination with Afinitor and Femara prior to surgical removal of the tumor. Part 1 of the trial is expected to enroll up to 18 patients to determine whether TRC105 can be administered safely concurrently with Afinitor and Femara and assess pharmacokinetic parameters. Part 2 of the trial is expected to enroll up to 20 patients with locally advanced potentially resectable hormone-receptor positive and Her-2 negative breast cancer to determine the pathologic complete response rate and downstaging rate, or rate of tumor size reduction, at the time of surgery. We expect to have top line data in the first half of 2018.

Phase 1 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin in Patients with Lung Cancer
 
We initiated dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin for the initial treatment of advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in 2016. The combination of Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin is approved for the initial treatment of advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and the combination of Taxol and Avastin is approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer. The primary endpoint of the trial is to determine whether TRC105 can be safely administered concurrently with Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin. Up to 18 patients are expected to be treated with TRC105 concurrently with Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics, overall response rate by RECIST 1.1, progression-free survival and overall survival. We expect to have top line data in the second half of 2017.
 Completed Clinical Trials of TRC105
 
Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Avastin in Patients with Glioblastoma
 
NCI sponsored a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with glioblastoma that included more than 50 sites in the United States. Part 1 of the trial was a dose escalation study of TRC105 in combination with Avastin in 12 patients and completed enrollment in January 2014. In Part 2 of the trial, 101 glioblastoma patients who received chemotherapy or radiation therapy and had not been treated previously with Avastin or another VEGF inhibitor were randomized in equal proportions to receive TRC105 and Avastin or Avastin alone. The primary endpoint was a three month improvement in PFS from the expected value of 3.45 for single agent Avastin. Top-line data indicate that the combination of TRC105 and Avastin did not improve median PFS versus single agent Avastin. However the combination was associated with a non-significant increase in overall survival. Detailed data and correlative analyses are expected to be presented at an oncology conference in 2017.  
 
Phase 1 First-in-Human Clinical Trial of TRC105 in Patients with Advanced and Treatment-Resistant Cancer
 
We conducted a Phase 1, single agent, first-in-human ascending dose clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity of TRC105 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine the recommended dose of TRC105 for Phase 2 clinical trials and assess overall safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included analysis of TRC105 distribution in the blood, assessment of whether antibodies were made in response to treatment with TRC105 and assessment of preliminary signs of antitumor activity. Given the limited number of patients in this clinical trial, no statistical analyses were performed. Fifty patients were treated with escalating doses of TRC105 until cancer progression or unacceptable toxicity was reached using a standard dose escalation design at dose levels of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 15 mg/kg given weekly or every two weeks. The maximum tolerated dose was exceeded at 15 mg/kg given weekly due to anemia, an expected adverse event of TRC105 treatment. TRC105 exposure increased with increasing dose, and continuous serum concentrations that saturate endoglin receptors were maintained at 10 mg/kg given weekly and 15 mg/kg given every two weeks. The safety profile was distinct from that of VEGF inhibitors, and the adverse effects of hypertension and proteinuria seen commonly with VEGF inhibitors were rarely observed with TRC105. Pulmonary edema and low platelet counts, which are side effects of other inhibitors of the endoglin pathway, were not observed. Lastly, patients at the 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg dose levels were observed to have dilated blood vessels in the skin or mucosal membranes, similar to those in patients with Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, indicating inhibition of the endoglin pathway. Results of this clinical trial were published in Clinical Cancer Research in 2012.
 
Phase 2 Compassionate Use Clinical Trials of TRC105 with Avastin in Patients with GTN
 
We completed three single patient Phase 2 clinical trials of TRC105 in combination with Avastin, in two women with choriocarcinoma and one man with Epithelioid Trophoblastic Tumor (ETT), which are forms of GTN. Choriocarcinoma is a rare tumor of reproductive tissue that is typically vascular and may highly express endoglin on the tumor tissue. Data were reported at the Annual Meeting of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology in 2016 in one patient who had persistent and unresectable metastatic choriocarcinoma that had recurred despite multiple treatments, including laparoscopic hysterectomy, five prior chemotherapy regimens and autologous stem cell transplant.  The patient was treated with TRC105 dosed 10 mg/kg weekly in combination with Avastin dosed 10 mg/kg every other week. The patient completed 9 cycles (36 weeks) of treatment and has now been off study for over 24 months with an ongoing durable complete response. Beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β‐hCG), a known and reliable marker of disease burden in choriocarcinoma, normalized during the fourth cycle of treatment. A second patient also with refractory and unresectable metastatic choriocarcinoma was treated with TRC105 and Avastin and did not respond to treatment. A male patient with refractory ETT did not respond to treatment with single agent TRC105 or the combination of TRC105 and Avastin.

 
Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Avastin in Patients with Advanced and Treatment-Resistant Cancer
 
We completed a Phase 1/2 ascending dose trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity of TRC105 in combination with an approved dose of Avastin in patients with advanced and treatment-resistant 
 13

solid tumors. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine the recommended dose of TRC105 to be used in combination with Avastin for Phase 2 clinical trials and assess overall safety and tolerability of the combination. Secondary endpoints included analysis of TRC105 distribution in the blood, assessment of whether antibodies were made in response to treatment with TRC105 and assessment of preliminary evidence of improved anti-tumor activity when TRC105 was combined with Avastin. Given the limited number of patients in this clinical trial, no statistical analyses were performed. Thirty-eight patients primarily with colorectal and ovarian cancer were treated with escalating doses of TRC105 until cancer progression or unacceptable toxicity was reached using a standard dose escalation design at dose levels of 3, 6, 8 and 10 mg/kg given weekly, in combination with an approved dose of Avastin. TRC105 and Avastin were generally well tolerated when dosed together at their recommended single agent doses (10 mg/kg each) when the initial dose of TRC105 was delayed by one week and divided over two days to reduce the frequency and severity of headache. The concurrent administration of Avastin and TRC105 did not otherwise appear to increase the frequency or severity of known toxicities of TRC105 or Avastin. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that treatment with Avastin increased endoglin expression on endothelium, a finding that was consistent with preclinical studies indicating endoglin may allow continued angiogenesis despite inhibition of the VEGF pathway. This finding provides support for targeting angiogenesis with endoglin antibodies in combination with VEGF inhibitors. Pharmacokinetic studies also indicated that serum levels of TRC105 were continuously present at concentrations above levels needed to inhibit endoglin function. Antibodies to TRC105 were detected in two patients and were not associated with clinical effects. Biomarker studies indicated increased blood levels of platelet-derived growth factor, or PDGF, a soluble protein that plays a significant role in angiogenesis, in patients treated with TRC105 in combination with Avastin. Several patients, including patients with colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer whose cancer had previously progressed on Avastin or small molecule VEGF inhibitors, experienced responses, including ten partial responses as assessed by Choi criteria, two of which were also partial responses as assessed by RECIST 1.1.
 
The best response by maximum percent change decrease in target lesion size of each of 30 patients enrolled in the trial with measurable disease who underwent efficacy assessment is noted in the figure below, and patients who received prior treatment with at least one VEGF inhibitor are indicated by a star. Of 25 evaluable patients treated previously with VEGF inhibitors, 16 patients (64%) had stable disease, of whom two patients (8%) had partial responses as assessed by RECIST 1.1. Ten patients who received prior VEGF treatment (40%) had a partial response by Choi criteria and are denoted with a solid triangle and a star in the figure below. Six patients (24%) with responses by Choi criteria or RECIST 1.1 remained without cancer progression for longer than during their prior VEGF inhibitor therapy, and are therefore considered to have durable responses.

These collective data demonstrate that TRC105 is active with Avastin based on decreases of tumor size and durability of treatment in patients whose cancer progressed on prior treatment with Avastin or other VEGF inhibitors.
 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 as a Single Agent or Combined with Avastin in Patients with Glioblastoma that Progressed on Prior Avastin Treatment
 
We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of TRC105 in combination with Avastin in patients with glioblastoma that progressed on prior initial treatment with combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy and subsequent treatment with Avastin. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine median overall survival, and secondary endpoints included assessment of tolerability and determination of response rate and time to tumor progression. After an initial portion of the trial assessing the safety of TRC105 as a single agent, 16 patients were treated with TRC105 at 10 mg/kg given weekly with Avastin at 10 mg/kg given every two weeks until cancer progression or unacceptable toxicity was reached. The concurrent administration of TRC105 and Avastin did not appear to increase the frequency or severity of known toxicities of TRC105 or Avastin. Overall survival in the 16 patients treated with TRC105 and Avastin was 5.7 months, which was statistically longer than the overall survival of 4 month expected in this population specified in the protocol based on historical data. The majority of patients with Avastin-resistant glioblastoma who enrolled in the trial had cancer progression in fewer than four months on prior Avastin treatment, and median progression-free survival was two months following treatment with TRC105 and Avastin. No patient demonstrated an objective response. Future clinical trials will focus on enrolling patients with glioblastoma prior to Avastin treatment, when they may be more likely to be responsive to angiogenesis inhibition.
 
Phase 1 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Xeloda in Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer
 
We completed a Phase 1 ascending dose clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of TRC105 in combination with Xeloda. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine the recommended dose of TRC105 to be used in combination with Xeloda for Phase 2 clinical trials and to assess overall safety and tolerability of the combination. Secondary endpoints included analysis of TRC105 distribution in the blood, assessment of whether antibodies were made in response to treatment with TRC105 and assessment of preliminary evidence of improved anti-tumor activity when TRC105 was combined with Xeloda. Given the limited number of patients in this clinical trial, no statistical analyses were performed. Nineteen patients, primarily with metastatic breast cancer, were treated with escalating doses of TRC105 until cancer progression or unacceptable toxicity was reached using a standard dose escalation design at dose levels of 7.5 and 10 mg/kg given weekly, in combination with the recommended single agent dose of Xeloda of 1,000 mg/m2 given twice daily for two weeks followed by a one week rest period. TRC105 and Xeloda were generally well tolerated when dosed together at their recommended single agent doses. The concurrent administration of TRC105 with Xeloda did not otherwise appear to increase the frequency or severity of expected toxicities of TRC105 or Xeloda. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated continuous serum levels of TRC105 at doses above target concentrations at both TRC105 dose level. Antibodies to TRC105 were detected in one patient. Several patients demonstrated evidence of clinical benefit, including one patient with metastatic breast cancer who achieved a partial response as assessed by RECIST 1.1.
Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Avastin in Patients with Renal Cell Carcinoma
 
NCI completed enrollment of a Phase 2 clinical trial to study the activity of TRC105 in combination with Avastin, compared to treatment with Avastin alone, in patients with renal cell carcinoma that included non-clear histology. The NCI-sponsored trial in renal cell carcinoma included approximately 20 centers in the United States and enrolled patients with all histologic types of renal cell carcinoma who had received as many as four prior systemic therapies, including as many as four prior VEGF inhibitors, and had not been treated with Avastin previously. The trial was designed to randomize 88 total patients in equal proportions to receive TRC105 
 15

and Avastin or Avastin alone with the goal of demonstrating a 100% increase in progression-free survival. However, an interim analysis performed in September 2014 concluded that the trial was unlikely to achieve the primary endpoint, and enrollment was closed following the accrual of 62 patients. Data reported at the ASCO annual meeting in June 2015 by NCI indicated no statistical difference in progression free survival between patients treated with TRC105 and Avastin compared to patients treated with single agent Avastin.
 
Other Phase 1 and Phase 2 Clinical Trials of TRC105 in Cancer Patients
 
A Phase 1, single agent, ascending dose clinical trial sponsored by NCI enrolled 21 patients with metastatic and treatment-resistant prostate cancer and results were published in the British Journal of Urology in 2014. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine the recommended dose of TRC105 to be used in Phase 2 clinical trials and to assess overall safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included analysis of TRC105 distribution in the blood, assessment of whether antibodies were made in response to treatment with TRC105 and assessment of preliminary evidence of improved anti-tumor activity. Given the limited number of patients in this clinical trial, no statistical analyses were performed. TRC105 was tolerated at 20 mg/kg every other week with a safety profile distinct from that of VEGF inhibitors. A significant induction of plasma VEGF was associated with CD105 reduction, suggesting anti-angiogenic activity of TRC105. An exploratory analysis showed a tentative correlation between the reduction of CD105 and a decrease in PSA velocity, suggestive of potential activity of TRC105 in the patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer. The data from this exploratory analysis suggested that rising VEGF level was a possible compensatory mechanism for TRC105-induced anti-angiogenic activity. A Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 sponsored by NCI enrolled 13 patients with advanced or metastatic bladder cancer that had progressed on prior treatment with chemotherapy. Results published in Clinical Genitourinary Cancer indicated TRC105 was well tolerated and did not improve 6-month PFS in heavily pretreated patients with advanced urothelial cell cancer. TRC105 pharmacodynamic effects, including a decreased level of Treg cells among CD4+ T cells, were noted.
 
A Phase 2 clinical trial sponsored by NCI enrolled 11 patients with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma that had progressed on prior treatment with Nexavar. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine the time to tumor progression. Data published in the United European Gastroenterology Journal indicated no grade 3 or grade 4 treatment-related toxicities. Most frequent toxicities were headache and nosebleeds.  A total accrual of 27 patients was planned. However, in accordance with the study design, only 11 patients were enrolled. One patient had a confirmed partial response by RECIST and biologic response on MRI scan but the four-month PFS was insufficient to proceed to the second stage of the study.
 
Our Phase 2 clinical trial in 23 patients with advanced or metastatic ovarian cancer that had progressed on prior treatment with platinum chemotherapy treated with TRC105 at 10 mg/kg every week indicated limited anti-tumor activity, as evidenced by a minor tumor reduction in one patient and tumor marker reductions in several other patients. However, no patients achieved either of the dual primary endpoints of being free of tumor progression for at least six months or achieving a partial response as assessed by RECIST 1.1. Subsequent data from a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Avastin suggested advanced ovarian cancer patients were more likely to benefit from the combination treatment. These data are consistent with preclinical findings indicating that inhibition of the VEGF or endoglin pathway individually is less effective than inhibition of the VEGF and endoglin pathways simultaneously. Avastin was recently approved in the United States with chemotherapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer, and we expect to develop TRC105 in combination with Avastin and chemotherapy in this indication.
 
Safety of TRC105 as a Single Agent and in Combination with Approved VEGF Inhibitors
 
In clinical trials as of December 31, 2016, TRC105 has been administered to more than 500 patients and was generally well tolerated as a single agent and in combination with VEGF inhibitors. The most commonly reported adverse events related to TRC105 therapy, either alone or in combination, include anemia, dilated small vessels in the skin and mucosal membranes (which may result in nosebleeds and bleeding of the gums), headache, fatigue and gastrointestinal and other symptoms during the initial infusion of TRC105, or infusion reaction. Infusion reactions were reduced in frequency and severity through the use of premedication. The majority of treatment-related adverse events have been mild. Serious adverse events considered related to TRC105 have largely been isolated events.
 
TRC105 does not appear to be highly immunogenic and patients with anti-drug-antibodies have not demonstrated specific clinical effects.
 

TRC105 Investigational New Drug Applications
 
We are evaluating TRC105 in the United States in clinical trials under three INDs, the first of which we filed with the FDA in November 2007 for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors, and the second of which we filed with the FDA in September 2014 for the treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma, and subsequently gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, and the third of which we filed with the FDA in June 2016 for the treatment of patients with sarcoma. Subsequent amendments to the first IND have included clinical protocols to study TRC105 alone, or in combination with VEGF inhibitors, in patients with multiple tumor 
 16

types. TRC105 has also been studied in the United States under three INDs sponsored by NCI to evaluate TRC105 in patients with prostate cancer, liver cancer and bladder cancer, which NCI filed in December 2009, December 2010 and August 2010, respectively, and one IND sponsored by NCI to evaluate TRC105 in patients with renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma, which NCI filed in April 2012. The INDs filed by NCI cross reference our initial solid tumor IND.
 
Translational Research
 
Studies of endoglin biology using choriocarcinoma cell lines indicate that higher levels of endoglin expression are associated with greater degrees of resistance to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy treatment also led to an increase in endoglin expression on choriocarcinoma cell lines. Serum endoglin and BMP levels were higher in pretreatment samples of women who developed GTN that was resistant to chemotherapy, with BMP levels showing a greater ability to predict resistance than the traditional scoring system that is routinely used to assess prognosis in GTN. We plan to assess BMP levels in patients with GTN and other tumor types as part of ongoing Phase 2 studies to determine if serum levels of this activating endoglin ligand will predict which patients are most responsive to TRC105 treatment.  Soluble biomarker studies in patients with renal cell carcinoma in a Phase 1b trial indicated that baseline osteopontin and TGF-β receptor 3 concentrations were associated with response rate.  Assessment of endoglin expression on archival tumor tissue from patients with soft tissue sarcoma did not indicate that tumor endoglin expression correlated with improved PFS following treatment with TRC105 and Votrient.  Circulating tumor cells will be studied in the Phase 3 angiosarcoma trial to assess whether endoglin expression on tumor cells at the time of treatment initiation correlate with efficacy.
 
Role of Endoglin Antibodies in AMD Treatment
 
Overview of AMD
 
AMD is a major public health problem that has a devastating effect on patients. AMD distorts central vision, which is necessary for daily activities such as reading, face recognition, watching television and driving and can lead to loss of central vision and blindness. According to a 2010 study sponsored by AMD Alliance International, the annual direct healthcare system cost of visual impairment worldwide due to AMD was estimated at approximately $255 billion.
 
According to the Macular Degeneration Partnership, approximately 15 million people in the United States and 30 million people worldwide suffer from some form of AMD. There are two forms of AMD: dry AMD and wet AMD. It is reported that wet AMD represents approximately 10% of all cases of AMD, but is responsible for 90% of the severe vision loss associated with the disease. Wet AMD is the leading cause of blindness in the Western world.
 
In a subset of AMD patients, dry AMD progresses to wet AMD as a result of abnormal angiogenesis in the choroid layer beneath the retina, which is referred to as choroidal neovascularization, or CNV. In the context of wet AMD, CNV is associated with the accumulation of other cell types and altered tissue. The new blood vessels associated with this abnormal angiogenesis tend to be fragile and often bleed and leak fluid into the macula, the central-most portion of the retina responsible for central vision and color perception. If left untreated, the blood vessel growth and associated leakage typically lead to retinal distortion and eventual retinal scarring, with irreversible destruction of the macula and loss of vision. This visual loss occurs rapidly with a progressive course.
 
Currently Available Therapies for Wet AMD
 
The current standard of care for wet AMD is administration by intraocular injection of VEGF inhibitors as single agents. VEGF inhibitors have been reported to be effective in treating wet AMD because of their ability to inhibit the effects of abnormal angiogenesis that defines CNV. The FDA has approved the VEGF inhibitors Lucentis (ranibizumab), Eylea and Macugen (pegaptanib sodium) for the treatment of wet AMD. Lucentis is an antibody fragment derived from the same full length antibody from which Avastin was derived. In 2016, annual worldwide sales of Lucentis and Eylea for all indications totaled more than $8.0 billion. This sales number does not include Avastin, which is commonly used off-label to treat wet AMD in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in the European Union.
 
The availability of VEGF inhibitors has significantly improved visual outcomes for many patients with wet AMD. A retrospective study published in 2012 confirmed that the prevalence of both legal blindness and moderate visual impairment in patients two years after being diagnosed with wet AMD has decreased substantially following the introduction of VEGF inhibitor therapy. Nonetheless, the condition of many patients with wet AMD treated with VEGF inhibitors does not improve significantly and in many cases deteriorates.
 
VEGF inhibitors prevent VEGF from binding to its natural receptor on endothelial cells in the abnormal new blood vessels, thereby inhibiting further CNV and leakage associated with wet AMD. However, VEGF inhibitor therapy may be limited in its ability to improve CNV. Results of third-party clinical trials suggest that visual outcomes for wet AMD patients receiving treatment with a VEGF inhibitor worsen over time and are often associated with the development of subretinal fibrosis and the growth of CNV over 
 17

time.  At the present time, the development of agents that effectively complement approved treatment in wet AMD remains an unmet need.
 
As is the case with angiogenesis that drives tumor growth, we believe that the endoglin pathway serves as an escape pathway that allows continued CNV despite inhibition of the VEGF pathway. In addition, the impact of VEGF inhibitors may be limited by the activity of pericytes, which are the cells that cover the outside of blood vessels and support and stabilize newly formed vessels. Pericytes are not targeted by VEGF inhibitor therapies, but because they express endoglin, they are an additional target for endoglin antibodies such as TRC105. These facts provide the rationale for treating wet AMD with a combination of endoglin antibodies and VEGF inhibitors.
 
DE-122 for Wet AMD
 
Our endoglin antibodies for ophthalmology indications are being developed in collaboration with Santen. We have produced a formulation of TRC105 for development in ophthalmology that Santen is developing under the name DE-122. In June 2015, Santen filed an IND with the FDA for the initiation of clinical studies for DE‐122 in patients with wet AMD.  Santen is currently enrolling the Phase 1/2 PAVE clinical trial of DE-122 in wet AMD patients and top-line data are expected in 2017. In addition, we expect Santen to initiate the Phase 2 AVANTE clinical trial of DE-122 in wet AMD in 2017 and that this Phase 2 clinical trial will test DE-122 in patients receiving treatment with a VEGF inhibitor.
 
Role of Endoglin Antibodies in Fibrotic Disease Treatment
 
Overview of Fibrosis
 
Fibrosis is a condition characterized by the harmful buildup of excessive fibrous tissue leading to scarring and ultimately organ failure. It is caused by the abnormal secretion of fibrous proteins, including collagen, by fibroblasts, which are cells that are present in all skin and connective tissue. As a result, fibrosis can affect almost any organ. Endoglin is expressed on fibroblasts, and its expression may be important to cell function. Increased endoglin expression has been demonstrated on fibroblasts from patients with heart failure and may play a role in the development of cardiac fibrosis as well as fibrotic diseases involving other organs. Examples of fibrotic diseases that may be initial target indications for endoglin antibodies include NASH, IPF, and neurofibromatosis.
 
NASH is a common and serious chronic liver disease caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, or steatosis, which induces inflammation and may lead to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis, followed by eventual liver failure and death. NASH is considered to be the second leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma, and its prevalence is increasing. NASH is believed to be one of the most common chronic liver diseases worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 2% to 5% of the general adult population in the United States, and an estimated prevalence of 2% to 3% in Europe and other developed countries. There are currently no therapeutic products approved for the treatment of NASH. Current treatment options are limited to off-label therapies. Given the lack of available treatment options, we believe that there is a significant unmet need for a novel therapy for NASH, particularly in those patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.
 
IPF is a disease characterized by progressive fibrosis of the lungs, which leads to their deterioration and destruction. The cause of IPF is unknown. Research suggests that there are between 40,000 and 80,000 diagnosed cases of IPF in the United States, with similar prevalence in the European Union. Esbriet (pirfenidone) is approved for the treatment of mild to moderate IPF in the United States, the European Union and other countries. OFEV (nintedanib) has been approved for the treatment of IPF in the United States and has been submitted for regulatory approval in the European Union.
 
Cutaneous neurofibromatosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by tumors of the skin, nervous, system and skeleton, for which there is no approved treatment.  The prevalence of the disease in the United States is approximately 100,000 patients and affected patients are predisposed to develop certain cancers. 

 
The Role of Endoglin in Fibrosis
 
Preclinical and clinical data identified increased endoglin expression on fibroblasts in the left ventricle of patients with heart failure and demonstrated that inhibiting endoglin limits TGF-β signaling and production of fibrotic proteins by human cardiac fibroblasts. Inhibiting endoglin function decreased cardiac fibrosis, preserved left ventricular function, and improved survival in mouse models of heart failure. In the figure below, wild-type mice (“WT” in the figure below) that contain both copies of the endoglin gene develop fibrosis, as evidenced by collagen deposition darkly stained in the figure below, at four and ten weeks following the induction of heart failure. However, in endoglin deficient mice fibrosis was decreased at four and ten weeks, as evidenced by the lack of dark stain (“Eng +/-” in the figure below). Survival also improved in endoglin-deficient mice. Studies using TRC105 demonstrated that TRC105 reversed cardiac fibrosis in mouse models. These data were published in Circulation and the Journal of the American Heart Association. Subsequent preclinical research in mouse models indicated that antibodies to endoglin inhibit liver fibrosis. In 
 18

2016, data were presented at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Annual Meeting from two separate liver fibrosis models.  The data presented showed treatment with an endoglin antibody significantly decreased the percentage of the liver fibrosis area induced by carbon tetrachloride, and treatment with endoglin antibodies also significantly reduced the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score in a model of NASH. Endoglin antibodies demonstrated hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. In addition, an endoglin antibody that competitively inhibited bone morphogenic protein (BMP) binding to endoglin more effectively reduced the NAFLD activity score, suggesting that inhibition of BMP function is an important mechanism of action of endoglin antibodies in models of fibrosis.  However, studies to date have not validated BMP signal inhibition as the mechanism of action of TRC105 in these models. Notably, a patient with cutaneous neurofibromatosis treated with TRC105 and a VEGF inhibitor in an oncology trial demonstrated reduction in the cutaneous lesions that characterize the disease. 
 
Cardiac Fibrosis in Wild-Type Mice and Endoglin-Deficient Mice
 

TRC205 and TRC105 Development in Fibrotic Diseases
 
We may study TRC105 in additional patients with cutaneous neurofibromatosis. We have also used our knowledge of the endoglin pathway to design and evaluate a fully humanized and deimmunized endoglin antibody called TRC205. We have cloned this antibody and demonstrated high affinity binding to human endoglin. We are currently evaluating options for TRC205 which may include filing an IND or a corporate partnership.
 
Our Second Product Candidate – TRC102
 
Overview of Base Excision Repair and the Mechanism of Action of TRC102
 
Base-excision repair, or BER, is a complex and fundamental cellular process used by cancer cells to repair the DNA damage caused by chemotherapeutics, especially the classes of chemotherapeutics known as alkylating agents, including Temodar, dacarbazine and bis-dichloroethyl-nitrosourea, or BCNU, and anti-metabolite agents, including Fludara and Alimta. The process of BER removes DNA bases damaged by chemotherapy, resulting in the formation of gaps in the DNA strand called apurinic and apyrimidinic, or AP, sites. The appropriate base is then inserted in this gap to restore the proper tumor DNA sequence. By this process, cancer cells can circumvent the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapy.
 
Inhibition of BER has been proposed as a way to improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutics; however, to our knowledge, no inhibitors of BER have been tested in clinical trials. We are developing TRC102 (methoxyamine hydrochloride) to reverse resistance to specific chemotherapeutics by inhibiting BER. TRC102 interrupts BER by rapidly and covalently binding within AP sites, converting the AP site to a substrate for the enzyme topoisomerase II, which cleaves TRC102-bound DNA, resulting in an accumulation of DNA strand breaks that trigger cellular apoptosis, or programmed cell death, as illustrated in the figure below:
 
19



TRC102 binding results in apoptosis
 

The induction of apoptosis by TRC102 is relatively selective for cancer cells, which typically overexpress topoisomerase II. In nonmalignant cells with low topoisomerase II expression, TRC102-bound DNA is excised and replaced by a separate DNA repair system.
 
TRC102 Development in Oncology
 
TRC102 is being developed to reverse resistance to Temodar, an alkylating chemotherapeutic, as well as to Alimta and Fludara, two antimetabolite chemotherapeutics. We consider it advantageous to combine TRC102 with Alimta because Alimta is approved in one large market indication (lung cancer) and one orphan drug indication (mesothelioma). Temodar is an approved chemotherapeutic used as a standard of care agent to treat glioblastoma, and Fludara is an approved chemotherapeutic used as a standard of care agent to treat lymphoma and leukemia. In initial clinical trials of more than 100 patients, TRC102 has shown good tolerability and promising anti-tumor activity in combination with alkylating and antimetabolite chemotherapy.
 
We filed an IND for TRC102 in March 2008, Case Western filed an IND for TRC102 in March 2006, and NCI filed an IND for TRC102 in March 2013, all for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. The IND filed by NCI cross references our IND.
 
Phase 1 ascending dose clinical trials evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity of TRC102 were completed with Alimta in patients with advanced solid tumors, with Fludara in patients with hematologic malignancy and with Temodar in patients with solid tumors. In each trial, TRC102 was tolerable with the companion chemotherapeutic, and demonstrated signs of activity.  One patient treated with TRC102 and Alimta had a partial response as assessed by RECIST 1.1 and remained in our clinical trial without cancer progression for 14 months. In addition, 14 patients had stable disease for three or more cycles including patients with squamous cell lung cancer (three patients), epithelial ovarian cancer (three patients), colorectal cancer (two patients), non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (one patient), pancreatic cancer (one patient), prostate cancer (one patient), endometrial cancer (one patient), head and neck cancer (one patient) and breast cancer (one patient). These data were published in Investigational New Drugs in 2012. Case Western reported data from a trial of intravenous TRC102 given in combination with Fludara in a Phase 1 clinical trial at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting in December 2014. Anti-tumor activity, including partial response, was noted in patients with lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including patients treated previously with Fludara. Case Western reported data from a trial of TRC102 given intravenously in combination with Temodar in a Phase 1 clinical trial at the ASCO annual meeting in June 2015. Anti-tumor activity was noted in patients with ovarian cancer and neuroendocrine tumors.
 
The following table summarizes certain key information regarding ongoing clinical trials of TRC102 in cancer patients:
 
 20

 
 | | | Companion | Design 
------+----------------------------+---------+------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase | Indication | Sponsor | Treatment | (Number of Patients) 
1/2 | Mesothelioma | NCI | Alimta (Phase 2); Alimta + Cisplatin (Phase 1) | Dose escalation Phase 1 portion and single arm Phase 2 portion (58 total)
2 | Glioblastoma | NCI | Temodar | Multiple arm (66) 
1 | Lung Cancer | NCI | Chemoradiation | Dose escalation (15) 
1 | Solid Tumors and Lymphomas | NCI | Temodar | Dose escalation (65) 

 
The NCI reported data from the Phase 1 study of TRC102 in combination with Temodar in relapsed solid tumors and lymphoma patients at ASCO in 2016. There were no pharmacologic interactions between the two drugs and TRC102 target concentrations were achieved. Partial response was noted in patients with ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, and squamous cell lung cancer. Based on these data, the trial was expanded to enroll 15 patient additional cohorts with ovarian, colorectal and lung cancer. The study includes assessment of biomarkers in tumor tissue that associate with BER activation that may predict which patients are most responsive to treatment with TRC102.
 
Our Third Product Candidate - TRC253 
 
TRC253 Development
 
TRC253 (formerly JNJ-63576253) is a novel, orally bioavailable small molecule discovered and developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals that is a potent, high affinity competitive inhibitor of the wild type androgen receptor (AR) and multiple AR mutations, including the F876L mutation, and is under development for the treatment of men with prostate cancer. The AR F876L mutation results in an alteration in the ligand binding domain that confers resistance to current AR inhibitors, including Xtandi® (enzalutamide) and ARN-509 (apalutamide). The IND for TRC253 was filed in late 2016 and we expect to initiate dosing in a Phase 1/2 trial in the first half of 2017.
 
Activation of the AR is crucial for the growth of prostate cancer at all stages of the disease. Therapies targeting the AR have demonstrated clinical efficacy by extending time to disease progression, and in some cases, the survival of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, resistance to these agents is often observed and several molecular mechanisms of resistance have been identified, including amplification, overexpression, alternative splicing, or mutation of the AR.  
 
Initial clinical development of TRC253 will focus on the safety and activity in patients with resistance to current AR inhibitors, by specifically enrolling patients with mutations in the AR ligand binding domain, including F876L. AR mutations will be identified using circulating tumor DNA in a Phase 1/2 trial that will determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of TRC253, and then enroll two 30 patient cohorts in the Phase 2 portion of the study.  One of the Phase 2 cohorts will consist of patients with the F876L mutation and one cohort will consist of patients with other mutations conferring resistance to Xtandi or other drugs. TRC253 also potently inhibits signaling through the wild type AR and may also be developed in earlier lines of treatment as a single agent or in combination with drugs approved in prostate cancer.
 
TRC694 Pre-Clinical Development
 
TRC694 (formerly JNJ-6420694) is a novel, potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of NF-kB inducing kinase (NIK) with the potential to be first-in-class and was discovered by Janssen. Genetic alterations leading to stabilization of NIK are found in a subset of B-cell malignancies: multiple myeloma (approximately 12-20% of cases), mantle-cell lymphoma (approximately 17% of cases), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (approximately 9-15% of cases), classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In pre-clinical studies, TRC694 selectively repressed non-canonical NF-kB gene expression and inhibited proliferation of cell lines with NIK dysregulation in vitro and in vivo. We anticipate completing formulation development and development of a companion diagnostic to enable patient-directed therapy and submitting an IND for TRC694 in 2018.
 
 Product Development Platform
 
Our clinical operations, quality assurance and regulatory affairs groups are responsible for significant aspects of our clinical trials, including site selection, site qualification, site initiation, site monitoring, maintenance of the trial master file, regulatory compliance, drug distribution management, contracting and budgeting, database management, edit checks, query resolution, and clinical study report preparation. The use of this internal resource minimizes the cost associated with hiring CROs to manage clinical, regulatory and database aspects of the clinical trials that we sponsor. In our experience, this model has resulted in capital efficiencies and improved communication with clinical trial sites, which expedites patient enrollment and facilitates access to patient data compared to a CRO-managed model. We are leveraging this capital efficient model in our two recently initiated international clinical 
 21

trials, the Phase 2 clinical trial in GTN and the Phase 3 clinical trial in angiosarcoma.  In addition, we have an experienced chemistry, manufacturing and controls group that completes our product development platform.
 
We have also been able to advance clinical development of TRC105 and TRC102 in a capital-efficient manner through our collaboration with NCI. TRC105 and TRC102 have been selected by NCI for funding of Phase 1 and Phase 2 development. This highly competitive program is designed to accelerate the development of promising oncology drugs that target novel anti-cancer pathways. Notably the NCI collaborated with Genentech Inc. during the development of Avastin on Phase 3 clinical trials of Avastin in lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer and renal cell carcinoma that were important elements of the resulting Avastin approval in these indications. Phase 2 clinical trials of both TRC102 and TRC105 are being performed in collaboration with NCI. If merited by Phase 2 data, we expect to fund initial Phase 3 clinical trials of TRC105 and TRC102, and, based on NCI’s past course of conduct with similarly situated pharmaceutical companies in which it has sponsored pivotal clinical trials following receipt of positive Phase 2 data, we anticipate that NCI would sponsor Phase 3 clinical trials in additional indications.
 
Collaboration and License Agreements
 License Agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V.
 
In September 2016, we entered into a strategic licensing collaboration with Janssen for two novel oncology assets from Janssen’s early oncology development portfolio. The agreement grants us the rights to develop TRC253 (formerly JNJ-63576253), a novel small molecule high affinity competitive inhibitor of wild type androgen receptor (AR Mutant Program) and multiple AR mutant receptors which display drug resistance to approved treatments, which is intended for the treatment of men with prostate cancer, and TRC694 (formerly JNJ-6420694), a novel, potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of NF-kB inducing kinase (the NIK Program and, together with the AR Mutant Program, the Programs), which is intended for the treatment of patients with hematologic malignancies, including myeloma.
 
Janssen maintains an option, which is exercisable until 90 days after we demonstrate clinical proof of concept with respect to the AR Mutant Program, to regain the rights to the licensed intellectual property and to obtain an exclusive license to commercialize the compounds and certain other specified intellectual property developed under the AR Mutant Program. If Janssen exercises the option, Janssen will be obligated to pay us (i) a one-time option exercise fee of $45.0 million; (ii) regulatory and commercial based milestone payments totaling up to $137.5 million upon achievement of specified events; and (iii) royalties in the low single digits on annual net sales of AR Mutant Program products. If Janssen does not exercise the option, we would then have the right to retain worldwide development and commercialization rights to the AR Mutant Program, in which case, we would be obligated to pay to Janssen (x) development and regulatory based milestone payments totaling up to $45.0 million upon achievement of specified events, and (y) royalties in the low single digits based on annual net sales of AR Mutant Program products, subject to certain specified reductions.
 
With respect to the NIK Program, Janssen maintains a right, which is exercisable within 90 days following the date on which we demonstrate clinical proof of concept with respect to the NIK Program, to negotiate for a period of six months for a reversion of the related rights in the licensed intellectual property and to obtain an exclusive license to commercialize the compounds and certain other specified intellectual property developed under the NIK Program. If Janssen does not exercise its right of first negotiation, or, if after exercise of such right, Janssen and we are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of a reversion and exclusive license, and, in either case, we continue the development of the NIK Program, then we would be obligated to pay Janssen (i) development and regulatory based milestone payments totaling up to $60.0 million upon achievement of specified events, and (ii) royalties in the low single digits based on annual net sales of NIK Program products, subject to certain specified reductions.
 
The license agreement may be terminated for uncured breach (including failure to satisfy specified development and spending obligations we have in relation to the Programs), bankruptcy, or the failure or inability to demonstrate clinical proof of concept with respect to a particular Program during specified timeframes. In addition, the license and agreement will automatically terminate (a) with respect to the AR Mutant Program, upon Janssen exercising its option in respect of the AR Mutant Program and making payment of the option exercise fee to us or, if Janssen does not exercise the option, upon the expiration of all our payment obligations to Janssen with respect of the AR Mutant Program, and (b) with respect to the NIK Program, upon us and Janssen entering into an exclusive license agreement following Janssen’s exercise of its right of first negotiation or, if Janssen’s right of first negotiation with respect to the NIK Program expires and we do not enter into an exclusive license agreement, upon the expiration of all our payment obligations to Janssen with respect of the NIK Program. We may also terminate a Program or the Agreement in its entirety without cause, subject to specified conditions.
 
License Agreement with Santen
 
In March 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Santen, under which we granted Santen an exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents, information and know-how related to TRC105, or the TRC105 Technology. Under the agreement, as amended, Santen is permitted to use, develop, manufacture and commercialize TRC105 products for ophthalmology indications, 
 22

excluding systemic treatment of ocular tumors. Santen also has the right to grant sublicenses to affiliates and third party collaborators, provided such sublicenses are consistent with the terms of our agreement. In the event Santen sublicenses any of its rights under the agreement relating to the TRC105 Technology, Santen will be obligated to pay us a portion of any upfront and certain milestone payments received under such sublicense. 
 
Santen has sole responsibility for funding, developing, seeking regulatory approval for and commercializing TRC105 products in the field of ophthalmology. In the event that Santen fails to meet certain commercial diligence obligations, we will have the option to co-promote TRC105 products in the field of ophthalmology in the United States with Santen. If we exercise this option, we will pay Santen a percentage of certain development expenses, and we will receive a percentage of profits from sales of the licensed products in the ophthalmology field in the United States, but will not also receive royalties on such sales. 
 
We will own any and all discoveries and inventions made solely by us under the agreement, and Santen will own any and all discoveries and inventions made solely by Santen under the agreement. We will jointly own discoveries and inventions made jointly by us and Santen. We have the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the patents licensed to Santen under the agreement, and Santen has the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the patents it controls that are related to TRC105 and the patents owned jointly by us and Santen. Subject to certain limitations, if the party with the first right to enforce a patent fails to timely do so, the other party will have the right to enforce such patent. 
 
In consideration of the rights granted to Santen under the agreement, we received a one-time upfront fee of $10.0 million. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to a total of $155.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, of which $20.0 million relates to the initiation of certain development activities, $52.5 million relates to the submission of certain regulatory filings and receipt of certain regulatory approvals and $82.5 million relates to commercialization activities and the achievement of specified levels of product sales. If TRC105 products are successfully commercialized in the field of ophthalmology, Santen will be required to pay us tiered royalties on net sales ranging from high single digits to low teens, depending on the volume of sales, subject to adjustments in certain circumstances. In addition, Santen will reimburse us for all royalties due by us under certain third party agreements with respect to the use, manufacture or commercialization of TRC105 products in the field of ophthalmology by Santen and its affiliates and sublicensees. Royalties will continue on a country-by-country basis through the later of the expiration of our patent rights applicable to the TRC105 products in a given country or 12 years after the first commercial sale of the first TRC105 product commercially launched in such country. As of December 31, 2016, $3.0 million of the development milestones have been achieved and received in accordance with the agreement. 
 
Santen may unilaterally terminate this agreement in its entirety, or on a country-by-country basis, for any reason or for no reason upon at least 90 days’ notice to us (or 30 days’ notice if after a change in control). Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or dissolution or for the other party’s material breach of the agreement that remains uncured 90 days (or 30 days with respect to a payment breach) after receiving notice from the non-breaching party. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement continues in effect until the termination of Santen’s payment obligations. 
 
License Agreement with Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Health Research Inc.
 
In November 2005, we entered into a license agreement with Health Research Inc. and Roswell Park Cancer Institute, referred to collectively as RPCI. Under the agreement, as amended, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents and other intellectual property rights controlled by RPCI related to endoglin antibodies, including TRC105, and their therapeutic uses, which we refer to as the RPCI Technology, and a non-exclusive, worldwide license to certain know-how controlled by RPCI related to the RPCI Technology. Under the agreement, we are permitted to use, manufacture, develop and commercialize products utilizing the RPCI Technology in all fields of use. In addition, we are permitted to sublicense our rights under the agreement to third parties.
 
Under the agreement, we are responsible for development and commercialization activities for products utilizing the RPCI Technology, and we are obligated to use all commercially reasonable efforts to bring a product utilizing the RPCI Technology to market timely and efficiently.

We may unilaterally terminate this agreement in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason, upon at least 60 days’ notice to RPCI. RPCI may terminate the agreement if we fail to pay any amount due under the agreement or materially breach the agreement and the breach remains uncured 90 days after receiving notice. In the event of our bankruptcy, the agreement will automatically terminate. Unless otherwise terminated, the agreement will remain in effect on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last valid claim under the patents subject to the agreement.
 License Agreement with Case Western
 In August 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Case Western, under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents, know-how and other intellectual property controlled by Case Western related to methoxyamine, which we refer to as the TRC102 Technology. Under the agreement, as amended, we have the right to use, manufacture and commercialize products utilizing the TRC102 Technology for all mammalian therapeutic uses, and to sublicense these rights.
 Under the agreement, we are generally obligated to use our best efforts to commercialize the TRC102 Technology as soon as possible. We are also required to meet specified diligence milestones, and if we fail to do so and do not cure such failure, Case Western may convert our license into a non-exclusive license or terminate the agreement.
 In consideration of the rights granted to us under the agreement, we paid a one-time upfront fee to Case Western. In addition, we may be required to pay up to an aggregate of approximately $9.8 million in milestone payments, of which $650,000 relates to the initiation of certain development activities and approximately $9.1 million relates to the submission of certain regulatory filings and receipt of certain regulatory approvals. If products utilizing the TRC102 Technology are successfully commercialized, we will be required to pay Case Western a single-digit royalty on net sales, subject to adjustments in certain circumstances. Beginning on the earlier of a specified number of years from the effective date of the agreement and the anniversary of the effective date following the occurrence of a specified event, we will be required to make a minimum annual royalty payment of $75,000, which will be credited against our royalty obligations. In the event we sublicense any of our rights under the agreement relating to the TRC102 Technology, we will be obligated to pay Case Western a portion of certain fees we may receive under the sublicense. Our royalty obligations will continue through the later of (i) the expiration of any orphan drug marketing exclusivity for a product utilizing the TRC102 Technology, (ii) August 2026, or (iii) on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last valid claim under the TRC102 Technology or any patent we receive that is a derivative of the TRC102 Technology.

If we do so, we will be required to pay Case Western a termination fee. If we fail to pay any amount required under the agreement and do not cure the default within 90 days of receiving notice, Case Western will have to right to convert our exclusive license to a non-exclusive license or to terminate the agreement entirely. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s material breach of the agreement that remains uncured 60 days after receiving notice of the breach.
 License Agreement with Lonza Sales AG
 In June 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Lonza Sales AG, or Lonza, under which we obtained a world-wide non-exclusive license to Lonza’s glutamine synthetase gene expression system consisting of cell lines into which TRC105 may be transfected and corresponding patents and applications, which we refer to as the Lonza Technology. Under the agreement, we are permitted to use, develop, manufacture and commercialize TRC105 obtained through use of the Lonza Technology.
 In consideration for the rights granted to us under the agreement, we are required to pay Lonza a low single-digit percentage royalty on the net selling price of TRC105 product manufactured by Lonza. In the event that we or a strategic partner or collaborator manufactures the product, we will be required to pay Lonza an annual lump sum payment of £75,000, along with a low single-digit percentage royalty on the net selling price of the manufactured TRC105 product. In the event that we sublicense our manufacturing rights under the agreement (other than to a strategic partner or collaborator), we will be obligated to pay Lonza an annual lump sum payment of £300,000 per sublicense, along with a low single-digit percentage royalty on the net selling price of the manufactured TRC105 product. If, on a country-by-country basis, the manufacture or sale of the TRC105 product is not protected by a valid claim in a licensed patent, our royalty obligations in such country will decrease and will expire 12 years after the first commercial sale of the product.
 We may unilaterally terminate this agreement for any reason upon at least 60 days’ written notice to Lonza. Either party may terminate the agreement by written notice if the other party commits a breach and, if the breach is curable, does not cure the breach within 30 days of receiving notice from the non-breaching party. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement with written 
 24

notice in the event of the other party’s liquidation or appointment of a receiver. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement continues in effect until the later of the expiration of the last valid claim in a licensed patent or for so long as the know-how subject to the agreement is identified and remains secret and substantial.
 Cooperative Research and Development Agreements with NCI
 We are a party to three Cooperative Research and Development Agreements, or CRADAs, with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by NCI, for the development of TRC105 and TRC102 for the treatment of cancer. We entered into the two CRADAs governing the development of TRC105 in December 2010, or the 2010 CRADA, and January 2011, or the 2011 CRADA, respectively. The 2010 CRADA is with the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis of NCI, and the 2011 CRADA is with NCI’s Center for Cancer Research. We entered into the CRADA governing the development of TRC102 in August 2012.
 Under the CRADAs, as amended, NCI conducts clinical trials and non-clinical studies of either TRC105 or TRC102. We are responsible for supplying TRC105 for NCI’s activities under the TRC105 CRADAs.
 Pursuant to the terms of the 2010 CRADA, we are required to pay NCI $20,000 per clinical trial per year as well as expenses incurred by NCI in connection with carrying out its responsibilities under the 2010 CRADA, up to an aggregate maximum of $500,000 per year, as well as up to $5,000 per year for personnel-related expenses. At our discretion, we may also provide additional funding to support assays and other studies. In addition, we made a one-time payment of $20,000 to support regulatory filings. Under the 2011 CRADA, we are required to pay NCI $5,000 per year for support for its research activities, as well as up to $5,000 per year for personnel-related expenses. We may also provide funding for mutually agreed upon animal studies. Under the TRC102 CRADA, we are required to pay NCI $20,000 per year per Phase 1 clinical trial and $25,000 per year per Phase 2 clinical trial, as well as expenses incurred by NCI in connection with carrying out its responsibilities under the TRC102 CRADA, up to an aggregate maximum per year of $200,000. We may also provide funding to support assays and other studies, and if NCI supplies TRC102 for additional mutually approved clinical trials beyond the planned trials, we will reimburse NCI for costs associated with manufacturing TRC102. In addition, we made a one-time payment of $20,000 for the initial IND filing and may be required to make additional one-time payments of $10,000 each for additional IND filings. Funding for clinical trials beyond those contemplated by the 2010 CRADA or the TRC102 CRADA will be determined in an amendment to the applicable CRADA.
 Under each CRADA, each party individually owns all inventions, data and materials produced solely by its employees in the course of performing research activities pursuant to the CRADA. The parties jointly own any inventions and materials that are jointly produced by employees of both parties. Subject to certain conditions, we have the option under each CRADA to negotiate commercialization licenses from the government to intellectual property conceived or first reduced to practice in performance of the CRADA research plan that was developed solely by NCI employees or jointly by us and NCI employees.
 Each CRADA had an original five-year term, with the 2010 CRADA and the 2011 CRADA, both agreements as amended, expiring on December 22, 2018 and January 28, 2021, respectively, and the TRC102 CRADA expiring on August 7, 2017. Each CRADA may be terminated at any time by mutual written consent, and we or NCI may unilaterally terminate any of the CRADAs for any reason or no reason by providing written notice at least 60 days before the desired termination date.
 Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate, nor do we expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage, distribution or testing. We therefore rely on various third-party manufacturers for the production of our product candidates. TRC105 drug substance for our preclinical studies and clinical trials is manufactured by Lonza, a contract manufacturer that also manufactures approved biologic cancer treatments marketed by other companies and is compliant to U.S. and European regulatory standards.
 TRC105 drug substance is produced by Chinese hamster ovary, or CHO, cells developed at Lonza and manufactured using Lonza’s proprietary manufacturing and purification processes. 
 
On February 22, 2017, we entered into a manufacturing agreement, or the Manufacturing Agreement, with Lonza Biologics Tuas Pte Ltd, or Lonza, for the long-term manufacture and supply of registration and commercial batches of TRC105, the Company’s lead drug product candidate. Lonza has previously been providing TRC105 for clinical development on a batch by batch basis.  
 
Under the Manufacturing Agreement, Lonza has agreed to manufacture TRC105 pursuant to purchase orders and in accordance with the manufacturing specifications agreed upon between us and Lonza. The TRC105 drug substance will be manufactured at a Lonza facility that has not previously manufactured TRC105, and we and Lonza are obligated to cooperate to transfer the TRC105 manufacturing process to the facility. Initially, we are required to purchase and Lonza is obligated to supply certain batches prior to approval of TRC105 by the FDA or EMA. Following regulatory approval, we will be required to purchase and Lonza will be required to supply a minimum number of batches annually. In the event we cancel any purchase orders, we may be obligated to pay certain 
 25

cancellation fees.  In addition, we are obligated to pay a milestone fee to Lonza upon the earlier of the first approval of TRC105 by the FDA or EMA or our receipt of a complete response letter or non-approvability letter (or equivalent communication) indicating that the rejection of the marketing application was not due to a deficiency in Lonza’s facility, the manufacturing process or services performed by Lonza.
 
The Manufacturing Agreement has an initial term beginning on the effective date and ending on the seventh anniversary of the date of first regulatory approval of TRC105 by the FDA or EMA. The Manufacturing Agreement may be renewed for an additional three years upon the written agreement of both parties no later than the fifth anniversary of the date of first approval by the FDA or EMA. 
 Either party may terminate the Manufacturing Agreement due to a material breach of the Manufacturing Agreement by the other party, subject to prior written notice and a cure period, due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party, due to a force majeure event that prevents performance under the Manufacturing Agreement for at least six months, or if the parties fail to enter into an initial project plan within 90 days of the date of the Manufacturing Agreement (which period may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties). We may terminate the Manufacturing Agreement, subject to 60 days’ written notice, if we discontinue the TRC105 program, whether due to a notice of non-approval or withdrawal of marketing approval by a regulatory agency or otherwise.  In the event of a termination by us due to discontinuation of the TRC105 program or a termination by Lonza due to our material breach or insolvency or bankruptcy, we would be obligated to pay to Lonza certain batch cancellation and/or early termination fees.TRC105 drug product is produced by an FDA-registered contract manufacturer. Drug product is filter-sterilized and aseptically filled into single-use pharmaceutical grade vials and stoppered using an automated filling machine. The final drug product is stored refrigerated until used.
 TRC102 drug substance is manufactured through a standard chemical synthesis and may be obtained from multiple manufacturers.
 TRC205 drug substance and product is currently produced at research scale using standard antibody production methods. We expect to contract with a third-party manufacturer to prepare production-grade cell lines for the cGMP manufacture of TRC205 prior to initiating clinical trials.
 TRC253 and TRC694 drug substance and product are currently produced at research scale manufactured through a standard chemical synthesis and may be obtained from multiple manufacturers.
 Competition
 The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive, and we and our collaborators face competition with respect to each of our product candidates in their target indications. Many of the entities developing and marketing potentially competing products have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop.
 If our product candidates are approved, they will compete with currently marketed drugs and therapies used for treatment of the following indications, and potentially with drug candidates currently in development for the same indications.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of any approved product will include its efficacy, safety profile, price, method of administration and level of promotional activity.
 Oncology Therapies
 We are developing TRC105 to be used in combination with VEGF inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. If TRC105 is approved, it could compete with other non-VEGF angiogenesis inhibitors in development, including some that also target the endoglin pathway and have the potential to be combined with VEGF inhibitors or used independently of VEGF inhibitors to inhibit angiogenesis. Acceleron Pharma Inc., Amgen, Inc., MedImmune LLC, OncoMed Pharmaceuticals Inc., Pfizer Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Roche AG are each developing non-VEGF angiogenesis inhibitors, which are in various phases of clinical development. Pfizer’s product candidate targets the endoglin co-receptor ALK1 and is in a Phase 1b clinical trial in combination with Stivarga in patients with colorectal carcinoma. Acceleron’s product candidate targets the endoglin ligand BMP and is in a Phase 2b 
 26

clinical trial in combination with Inlyta in patients with renal cell carcinoma and a Phase 1b clinical trial in combination with Nexavar in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, drugs have recently been approved or are being developed that target other oncologic pathways, including immune surveillance targets, that may decrease the need for treatments, like TRC105, that target angiogenesis.
 We are developing TRC102 to be used in combination with alkylating chemotherapeutics (including Temodar) and antimetabolite chemotherapeutics (including Alimta and Fludara) for the treatment of cancer. If TRC102 is approved, it could compete with other inhibitors of DNA repair. Tesaro, Inc. and Astra Zeneca each market inhibitors of DNA repair that work by a mechanism of action that is distinct from that of TRC102. In addition to the therapies mentioned above, there are many generic chemotherapeutics and other regimens commonly used to treat various types of cancer, including soft tissue sarcoma and glioblastoma.
 We are developing TRC253 for the treatment of castrate resistant prostate cancer. If TRC253 is approved, it could compete with other androgen receptor inhibitors such as Xtandi, ODM-201 and apalutamide. In addition to the therapies mentioned above, there are many generic chemotherapeutics and other agents commonly used to treat prostate cancer.
 We are developing TRC694 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. If TRC694 is approved, it could compete with other NIK inhibitors that may be developed, as well as agents targeting other pathways in hematologic malignancies. 
 Wet AMD Therapies
 Our partner, Santen, is developing DE-122 for the treatment of wet AMD and other eye diseases. If DE-122 is approved as a single agent, it would compete with currently marketed VEGF inhibitors, including Avastin and Lucentis (marketed by Genentech in the United States), and Eylea (marketed by Regeneron in the United States), which are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors as the standard of care for the treatment of wet AMD. In addition, DE-122 could face competition from other VEGF inhibitors in development, such as Allergan’s VEGF inhibitor, DARPin, which is in Phase 2 clinical development for administration in a single intraocular injection. If approved in combination with VEGF inhibitor treatment, DE-122 could compete with other aniogenesis inhibitors in development including Regeneron’s antibody to Ang2, which entered Phase 2 development in 2016 in combination with Eylea.
Fibrotic Disease Therapies
 If TRC205 is approved for the treatment of diseases characterized by fibrosis, including NASH, IPF, and neurofibromatosis (NF), we anticipate that TRC205 could compete with other therapies being developed for the same or similar indications. In addition, TRC205 would compete with therapies currently used off-label to treat fibrotic diseases.
NASH
 There are currently no therapeutic products approved by the FDA for the treatment of NASH. Several marketed therapeutics are currently used off-label for this indication, such as insulin sensitizers (including metformin), antihyperlipidemic agents (including gemfibrozil), pentoxifylline and Ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol), but they have not been proven effective in the treatment of NASH. We are aware of several companies that have product candidates in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of NASH, including Genfit Corp. and Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In addition, we are aware of companies in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of NASH, including Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc., Galmed Medical Research Ltd., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Immuron Ltd., Shire plc, Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., NasVax Ltd., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, and there are other companies with candidates in earlier stage programs.
IPF
 Esbriet, which is marketed by InterMune, Inc., is approved for the treatment of mild to moderate IPF in the United States, the European Union and other countries. OFEV, which is marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim, a VEGF inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of IPF in the United States and the European Union. There are at least eight product candidates in various stages of Phase 2 development being pursued by Biogen Idec., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene Corporation, Fibrogen, Inc., Gilead, Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., Novartis AG and Sanofi S.A.
NF
 There are no approved drugs for NF. MEK inhibitors are being studied in ongoing clinical trials.
 27

Commercialization
 We hold worldwide commercialization rights for our oncology and fibrotic disease product candidates (subject to certain rights held by Janssen for TRC253), while Santen holds worldwide commercialization rights for our endoglin antibodies, including TRC105, in the field of ophthalmology. If any of our product candidates are approved in oncology indications, our plan is to build an oncology-focused specialty sales force in North America to support their commercialization and seek a partner to support commercialization outside of North America. We believe that a specialty sales force will be sufficient to target key prescribing physicians in oncology. We currently do not have any sales or marketing capabilities or experience. We plan to establish the required capabilities within an appropriate time frame ahead of any product approval and commercialization to support a product launch. 
Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our protein therapeutics, novel biological discoveries, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we expect to benefit from a variety of statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe, Japan and other countries that relate to the regulation of biosimilar molecules and orphan drug status. These statutory frameworks provide periods of non-patent-based exclusivity for qualifying molecules. See “Government Regulation.”
 Our patenting strategy is focused on our protein therapeutics. We seek composition of matter and method of treatment patents for each such protein in key therapeutic areas. We also seek patent protection with respect to companion diagnostic methods and compositions and treatments for targeted patient populations. We have sought patent protection alone or jointly with our collaborators, as dictated by our collaboration agreements.
 Our patent estate as of December 31, 2016, on a worldwide basis, includes 13 issued patents and allowed applications and 11 pending patent applications in the United States and 37 issued patents and allowed applications and 92 pending patent applications outside the United States with pending and issued claims relating to our product candidates. 22 of our issued US and foreign patents cover antibodies to endoglin and uses thereof that we have selected as the core focus of our development approach. These figures include in-licensed patents and patent applications to which we hold exclusive commercial rights in non-ophthalmologic fields of use.
 Individual patents extend for varying periods of time depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for twenty years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, however, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also twenty years from the earliest international filing date. Our issued patents and pending applications with respect to our protein therapeutic candidates will expire on dates ranging from 2016 to 2035, exclusive of possible patent term extensions. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of extensions of patent term, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 National and international patent laws concerning protein therapeutics remain highly unsettled. No consistent policy regarding the patent-eligibility or the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States, Europe or other countries. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drugs and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. The patent positions for our most advanced programs are summarized below:
 28

These applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2037. 
 29

Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Government Regulation
 The preclinical studies and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and sales, among other things, of our product candidates and future products, are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, pharmaceutical products are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, in addition to the FDA’s implementing regulations. We expect TRC105 to be regulated by the FDA as a biologic, which requires the submission of a BLA and approval by the FDA prior to being marketed in the United States. We expect our small molecule product candidate TRC102 to be regulated as a drug and subject to New Drug Application, or NDA, requirements, which are substantially similar to the BLA requirements discussed below. Manufacturers of our product candidates may also be subject to state regulation. Failure to comply with FDA requirements, both before and after product approval, may subject us or our partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to administrative or judicial sanctions, including FDA refusal to approve applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, fines and/or criminal prosecution.
 The steps required before a biologic may be approved for marketing of an indication in the United States generally include:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLPs, and other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, to establish that the biological product is “safe, pure and potent,” which is analogous to the safety and efficacy approval standard for a chemical drug product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA;
--+--------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with applicable current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, or cGMPs; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review of the BLA and issuance of a biologics license which is the approval necessary to market a biologic therapeutic product.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the biologic candidate. Preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations regarding GLPs. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Nonclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the preclinical testing, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase or phases of the clinical trial lends themselves to an efficacy determination. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA within the 30-day time period places the IND on clinical hold because of its concerns about the drug candidate or the conduct of the trial described in the clinical protocol included in the IND. The FDA can also place the IND on clinical hold at any time during drug development for safety concerns related to the investigational drug or to the class of products to which it belongs. The IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed.
 All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified principal investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the applicable phase of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in 
 30

the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution, approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, and monitor the study until completed.
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap and different trials may be initiated with the same drug candidate within the same phase of development in similar or differing patient populations. Phase 1 clinical trials may be conducted in a limited number of patients, but are usually conducted in healthy volunteer subjects for indications other than oncology. The drug candidate is initially tested for safety and, as appropriate, for absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.
 Phase 2 usually involves trials in a larger, but still limited, patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific, targeted indications to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks.
 Phase 3 trials are undertaken to further evaluate clinical efficacy of a specific endpoint and to test further for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3 testing might not be completed successfully within any specific time period, if at all, with respect to any of our product candidates. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 The FFDCA permits the FDA and an IND sponsor to agree in writing on the design and size of clinical studies intended to form the primary basis of a claim of effectiveness in a BLA or NDA. This process is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. A SPA agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began. For certain types of protocols, including carcinogenicity protocols, stability protocols, and Phase 3 protocols for clinical trials that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim, the FDA has agreed under its performance goals associated with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, to provide a written response on most protocols within 45 days of receipt. However, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goals, and additional FDA questions and resolution of issues leading up to a SPA agreement may result in the overall SPA process being much longer, if an agreement is reached at all.
 The results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the drug candidate for a proposed indication. Under the PDUFA, the fees payable to the FDA for reviewing a BLA, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products, can be substantial. The fees typically increase each year. Each BLA submitted to the FDA for approval is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following receipt by the FDA of the application. If the BLA is found complete, the FDA will file the BLA, triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. The FDA’s established goal is to review 90% of priority BLA applications within six months after the application is accepted for filing and 90% of standard BLA applications within 10 months of the acceptance date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA, however, may not approve a drug candidate within these established goals and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. Further, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but a “complete response letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. Before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the facility complies with cGMPs. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if applicable statutory or regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information, which can extend the review process. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or never be granted. If a product is approved, the approval may impose limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed, may require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, and may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. The FDA must approve a BLA supplement or a new BLA before a product may be marketed for other uses or before certain manufacturing or other changes may be made. Further post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product is required. Also, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur following initial marketing. In addition, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.

The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, created a pathway for licensure, or approval, of biological products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, earlier biological products licensed under the PHSA. Also under the BPCIA, innovator manufacturers of original reference biological products are granted 12 years of exclusivity before biosimilars can be approved for marketing in the United States. The objectives of the BPCIA are conceptually similar to those of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the “Hatch-Waxman Act,” which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of drug products. The approval of a biologic product biosimilar to one of our products could have a material adverse impact on our business as it may be significantly less costly to bring to market and may be priced significantly lower than our products.
 Both before and after the FDA approves a product, the manufacturer and the holder or holders of the BLA for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight. For example, quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform, on an ongoing basis, to cGMP requirements, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Other Healthcare Laws
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Orphan Drug Act
 TRC105 has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, which includes angiosarcoma in the US and EU. The United States Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States at the time of application for orphan drug designation. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the holder of the approval is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product except in very limited circumstances. For example, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain approval in the United States during the seven-year exclusive marketing period. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the drug.
 Legislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted outside the United States, including in the European Union and Japan. The orphan legislation in the European Union is available for therapies addressing chronic debilitating or life-threatening conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons or are financially not viable to develop. The market exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. The market exclusivity may be extended to 12 years if sponsors complete a pediatric investigation plan agreed upon with the relevant committee of the European Medicines Agency. Orphan legislation in Japan similarly provides for ten years of marketing exclusivity for drugs that are approved for the treatment of rare diseases and conditions.
 Exclusivity
 TRC105 and TRC205, as new biological products, will benefit, if approved, from the data exclusivity provisions legislated in the United States, the European Union and Japan. All three regions effectively provide a period of data exclusivity to innovator biologic products. U.S. legislation provides a 12-year period of data exclusivity from the date of first licensure of a reference biologic product. EU legislation provides a period of 10 to 11 years and Japan legislation provides a period of 8 years during which companies cannot be granted approval as generic drugs to approved biologic therapies. Protection from generic competition is also available for new chemical entities, including potentially the small molecule TRC102, in the United States for 5 years, in the European Union for 10 to 11 years and in Japan for 8 years.

Exclusivity in the European Union
 The European Union has led the way among the International Council for Harmonisation regions in establishing a regulatory framework for biosimilar products. The marketing authorization of generic medicinal products and similar biological medicinal products are governed in the European Union by Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC (2001). Unlike generic medicinal products, which only need to demonstrate bioequivalence to an authorized reference product, similar biological medicinal products are required to submit preclinical and clinical data, the type and quantity of which is dictated by class and product specific guidelines. In order to submit a marketing authorization for a similar biological medicinal product, the reference product must have been authorized for marketing in the European Union for at least 8 years. Biosimilars can only be authorized for use once the period of data exclusivity on the biological reference medicine has expired. In general, this means that the biological reference medicine must have been authorized for at least 10 years before a similar biological medicine can be made available by another company. The 10-year period can be extended to a maximum of 11 if, during the first 8 years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison to existing therapies.
 Many EU countries have banned interchangeability of biosimilars with their reference products to ensure adequate characterization of the safety profile of the biosimilar and to enable comparison to that of reference product.
 Exclusivity in Japan
 In 2009, Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, or MHLW, and Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency, or PMDA, issued the first Japanese guidance on biosimilars. The guideline (currently available only in Japanese), which shares common key features to EU guidelines, outlines the nonclinical, clinical and CMC requirements for biosimilar applications and describes the review process, naming conventions and application fees. 
 Japan does not grant exclusivity to pharmaceutical products; however, the country does have a Post Marketing Surveillance, or PMS, system that affects the timing of generic entry and, in effect, provides a period of market exclusivity to innovator products. This system allows safety data to be acquired for each product. A PMS period is set for most of new drug approvals, and until this period is over, generic companies cannot submit their applications for drug approvals as generic drugs. Recently, this period was extended to 8 years for all new drug approvals. Japan’s regulations do not allow currently for interchangeability of biosimilars with their reference products.
 Expedited Review and Approval
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and biologics, and/or provide for the approval of a drug or biologic on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the clinically meaningful outcome as predicted by the surrogate marker trial.
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
 Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, or a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. The FDA may decline to issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
 33

We have not received a Written Request for such pediatric studies, although we may ask the FDA to issue a Written Request for such studies in the future. To receive the six-month pediatric market exclusivity, we would have to receive a Written Request from the FDA, conduct the requested studies in accordance with a written agreement with the FDA or, if there is no written agreement, in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles, and submit reports of the studies. A Written Request may include studies for indications that are not currently in the labeling if the FDA determines that such information will benefit the public health. The FDA will accept the reports upon its determination that the studies were conducted in accordance with and are responsive to the original Written Request or commonly accepted scientific principles, as appropriate, and that the reports comply with the FDA’s filing requirements.
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologicals, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must include the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels, for such products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, the payors may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our products will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. Recent budgetary pressures in many European Union countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 Healthcare Reform
 There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the United States. It is uncertain what legislative proposals will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payors for medical goods and services may take in response to any healthcare reform proposals or legislation. We cannot predict the effect medical or healthcare reforms may have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect.
 34

Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, including our product candidates if approved.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be approved by the competent national health authority and by independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs and other applicable regulatory requirements.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. A favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 Additional Regulation
 We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by our operations. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 26 full-time employees and one part-time employee, 20 of whom are involved in research, development or manufacturing, and five of whom have Ph.D., Pharm.D. or M.D. degrees. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
