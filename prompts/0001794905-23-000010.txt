History and Background
Cyxtera was incorporated in Delaware as Starboard Value Acquisition Corp. (“SVAC”) on November 14, 2019. On July 29, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), SVAC consummated the business combination pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 21, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among SVAC, Cyxtera Technologies, Inc. (now known as Cyxtera Technologies, LLC), a Delaware corporation (“Legacy Cyxtera”), Mundo Merger Sub 1, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of SVAC (“Merger Sub 1”), Mundo Merger Sub 2, LLC (now known as Cyxtera Holdings, LLC), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of SVAC (“Merger Sub 2” and, together with Mundo Merger Sub 1, the “Merger Subs”), and Mundo Holdings, Inc. (“NewCo”), a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of SIS Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership and the sole stockholder of Legacy Cyxtera (“SIS”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Legacy Cyxtera was contributed to NewCo and then converted into a limited liability company and, thereafter, Merger Sub 1 was merged with and into NewCo, with NewCo surviving such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of SVAC, and immediately following such merger and as part of the same overall transaction, NewCo was merged with and into Merger Sub 2, with Merger Sub 2 surviving such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of SVAC (the “Business Combination” and, collectively with the other transactions described in the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”). On the Closing Date, and in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, SVAC changed its name to Cyxtera Technologies, Inc. 
Business Overview
We are a global data center leader in retail colocation and interconnection services. We provide an innovative suite of deeply connected and intelligently automated infrastructure and interconnection solutions to more than 2,300 leading enterprises, service providers and government agencies around the world – enabling them to scale faster, meet rising consumer expectations and gain a competitive edge.
We believe that our data center platform sets us apart from our competitors in the data center industry in the following ways:
•Global Footprint: Over 65 facilities in 33 markets on three continents.
•Breadth of Offering: Complete suite of colocation, connectivity and bare metal solutions.
•World-Class Platform: High-quality assets with dense connectivity and a strong customer ecosystem.
•Market Leadership: Recognized as a leader by customers and industry thought leaders.
•Continuous Innovation: Proven track record of developing innovative products and services.
We focus exclusively on carrier-neutral retail colocation, interconnection and related services, an area we believe represents the sweet spot within the broader data center industry.
We have a large global footprint, which includes key markets in North America, Europe and Asia. This scale and geographic reach enable us to deliver solutions to enterprises, service providers and government agencies in the locations where they want to be – near population centers, customers, employees and service providers – and to support their growth with deployments in multiple data centers across several markets. Our 251 MW of total power capacity and 56.6 MW of available expansion capacity is balanced across our platform, positioning us to meet the expanding requirements of our strong customer base.
The scale and density of our interconnection platform strengthens our customer value proposition. Our interconnection platform includes more than 307 individual network service providers, with an average of 24 per site; low latency connectivity to major public cloud zones from virtually all of our data centers; and more than 
40,000 cross-connects. Our interconnection solutions are the backbone of a global platform of data centers that operate as an ecosystem where our customers can easily connect to other enterprises and business partners, including a wide range of network service providers, public cloud service providers and “as a Service” providers. Utilizing innovative, software-defined and API-driven solutions, we make all of these products easier to consume, allowing customers to deploy, access and manage their IT infrastructure solutions with the click of a button.
We believe we have a stable and predictable business model, with more than 90% of our revenue being recurring revenue, fixed term customer contracts (typically three years), long-tenured customer relationships and network effects that drive customer stickiness.
Our Product Portfolio
We provide a variety of data center products and services that are specifically designed to address the needs of enterprises, service providers and government agencies. The following are our primary service and product offerings:
Colocation: We offer retail colocation services in 65 high-quality, highly connected data centers in 33 markets on three continents. Our colocation services provide customers space and power in our reliable, redundant and secure data centers to host their critical applications and workloads in an integrated ecosystem. Colocation space and power services are offered under fixed duration contracts (typically three years) and billed on a monthly basis generating monthly recurring revenue.
Interconnection: Our carrier- and cloud-neutral, densely connected global data center footprint and thriving partner ecosystem deliver the local, global and cloud connectivity options customers need for today’s distributed hybrid IT. We offer traditional physical cross connects as well as virtual cross connects that can be provisioned on-demand through the Cyxtera Digital Exchange. These offerings provide customers the ability to establish fast, convenient, affordable and highly reliable connections to their preferred network service providers, low latency public cloud on-ramps and a wide range of technology and network service providers and business partners. Interconnection services are offered on month-to-month contract terms and generate monthly recurring revenue.
Bare Metal: Cyxtera Enterprise Bare Metal is an on-demand IT infrastructure solution that allows customers to consume our data center services in a cloud-like fashion by enabling customers to purchase compute solutions “as a Service.” Our fully automated provisioning platform enables customers to seamlessly connect to partner services, including single-tenant, private bare metal servers from NVIDIA, Nutanix, Fujitsu, HPE and Dell. Enterprise Bare Metal offers the best of all worlds – rapid access to high-performance compute power to solve for even the most bandwidth-intensive AI and ML workloads, the ability to rapidly scale up and down in accordance with business requirements and the financial benefits associated with having a predictable monthly operating expense rather than a large, upfront capital purchase. Enterprise Bare Metal services are offered under fixed duration contracts and billed on a monthly basis generating monthly recurring revenue.
Cyxtera SmartCabs: Cyxtera SmartCabs are on-demand, dedicated colocation cabinets, complete with built-in power and integrated, configurable, core network fabric. Cyxtera SmartCabs allows customers to instantly deploy and dynamically configure their end-to-end colocation infrastructure in a cloud-like, on-demand model with direct access to a robust ecosystem of technology and service providers available across Cyxtera’s global platform. Integrated with Cyxtera’s massively scalable and highly secure network fabric and offering access to network connectivity from Cyxtera’s on-demand Layer 3 bandwidth solution, IP Connect, Cyxtera SmartCabs enable customers to achieve rapid connectivity in an as-a-service model without requiring them to bring in additional network hardware or incur further capital expenditures to get started. Cyxtera SmartCabs is currently available in 12 markets.
Deployment Services: We offer a variety of value-added services to help customers streamline data center deployment and reduce time-to-solution. These services are provided by our team of industry-recognized personnel and include custom data center installation and set-up, access to secure cages and cabinets, integrated structured 
cabling solutions including cage design, rack layout and rack elevation and the ability to deliver a turnkey environment. Deployment services are one-time in nature and generally billed at the time of completion or delivery.
Gold Support: Through our gold support services, our infrastructure professionals are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to assist customers with routine management of their environments such as server reboots, telecommunications support, equipment racking and stacking, operating system loading and magnetic tape backups of critical data. Gold support services can be consumed on an ad hoc basis or in pre-paid blocks, in each case generating non-recurring revenue. Customers can also elect to purchase recurring monthly blocks of gold support hours, generating monthly recurring revenue. 
Our Business Segment Financial Information
The Company manages its operations as a single operating segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions – the colocation segment. 
The Company derives the significant majority of its colocation revenue from sales to customers in the United States, based upon the service address of the customer. Revenue derived from customers outside the United States, based upon the service address of the customer, was not significant in any individual foreign country. 
Competition 
We compete with numerous providers of data center and interconnection services. Many of these companies own or operate data centers similar to ours in the same markets in which our data centers are located. Certain of our data center competitors include Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and Equinix, Inc. as well as several privately held data center services providers. We believe that we are differentiated from most competitors in the retail data center industry because we offer a true platform with the large scale and geographic reach of our data center portfolio, density of our interconnection platform – which creates an ecosystem where our customers can easily connect to other enterprises and business partners – and innovative, software-defined technologies that increase the value proposition for customers by making it easier for them to address their hybrid IT infrastructure needs. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.”
Customers
Our customers include network service providers, cloud and IT services providers, digital media and content providers, financial services companies and global enterprises in various industries. We have more than 2,300 customers, and Lumen accounted for 10% of the total revenues as of December 31, 2022. We provide each customer access to a choice of highly customized solutions based on their scale, colocation and interconnection needs. 
Intellectual Property
We rely on trademarks, domain names, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, contractual provisions and restrictions on access and use to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These include: trademark registrations and applications for “Cyxtera” and the Cyxtera logo; issued patents and pending patent applications covering various technologies related to our Cyxtera Digital Exchange offering; and various domain name registrations, including for “cyxtera.com.”
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 755 employees worldwide, with 672 based in the United States and Canada, 61 based in Europe, and 22 based in Asia-Pacific. Of those employees, 424 were in engineering and 
operations, 147 were in sales and marketing, and 184 were in management, finance and administration. In addition, of the 755 employees, 752 were full-time employees.
Commitment to Diversity
We have made a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace, one where everyone has the opportunity to fully participate and is valued for their distinctive skills, experiences and perspectives. We make all recruiting, payment, performance and promotion decisions based on merit, without discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, age, family status, ethnic origin, nationality, disability or religious belief.
Employee Development and Recognition
We have invested in resources and opportunities to allow our team members to develop and enhance their skills, including through Cyxtera University, our on-demand learning channel that allows employees to access homegrown and third-party learning tools and content. We seek to proactively recognize employees who are performing at a high level, including through quarterly “Spotlight Awards” that provide for cash bonuses and recognition on our quarterly all-employee town hall meetings.
In early 2022, we launched the Cyxtera Leadership Development Program, a strategic initiative designed to identify and develop the next generation of our company leadership. Participants, who range from Vice Presidents to individual contributors, were selected based on their current outstanding performance, overall skill set and leadership potential. The goal of the program is to work with each selected employee to assess their current leadership skills and identify areas of focus and improvement to enable and empower their future career path.
Employee Health and Safety
We are dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our team members, customers, partners and suppliers. To that end, our dedicated global health and safety function ensures that employees are trained on best practices to create a safe and healthy workplace for all. 
Employee Engagement and Satisfaction
We conduct periodic employee surveys as a means to receive feedback from our team members and improve employee engagement and satisfaction. We intend to conduct such surveys on at least an annual basis.
Sustainability
We are committed to protecting, connecting and powering a more sustainable digital world and to greening our customers’ supply chains. Through our sustainability efforts, Cyxtera strives to protect our planet and climate, unleash our people’s potential to be a force for good and lead with purpose and integrity in everything we do. Our definition of business growth and success includes steadfastly adhering to best-in-class environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices.
Environmental Matters
We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and could affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See “Risk Factors
—Risks Related to Environmental Laws and Climate Change Impacts—Environmental regulations may impose new or unexpected costs on us.”
Insurance
We carry comprehensive general liability, property, earthquake, flood and business interruption insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio. We also carry coverage for technology professional liability and cybersecurity. We have selected policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. In the opinion of our management, we maintain adequate insurance with limits and coverages we believe to be commercially reasonable. We do not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses such as loss from riots and war, because such coverage is not available or is not available at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, although we carry earthquake and flood insurance on our properties in an amount and with deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable, such policies are subject to limitations in certain flood and seismically active zones. Certain of the properties in our portfolio are located in areas known to be seismically active. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—The level of insurance coverage that we purchases may prove to be inadequate.”
