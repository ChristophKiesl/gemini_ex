Our specific business strategies are influenced by these industry factors and global trends and are focused on leveraging our resources to continue to develop and produce competitive product offerings. We believe the following strategies will allow us to maintain a balanced portfolio of commercial truck, industrial and aftermarket businesses covering key global markets. See Item 1A. Risk Factors below for information on certain risks that could have an impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future.
Launch of M2022 Plan
With the completion of our M2019 plan, we have now launched our M2022 Plan, The financial targets we established for our M2022 plan are the following:
•+$300 million in new business
•12.5 percent adjusted EBITDA margin
•$4.00 adjusted diluted earnings per share
•75 percent free cash flow conversion (free cash flow / adjusted income from continuing operations)
(see Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Item 7)
To achieve these aggressive targets, we are focused on four main areas:
•Drive Innovation
•Protect and Grow
•Exceed Customer Expectations
•Enable the Business
Drive Innovation
For 110 years, our products have evolved to meet the changing needs of our customers in major regions of the world. As technology has advanced, we have designed products that are more fuel efficient, lighter weight, safer, more durable and more reliable. During the M2022 cycle, we have targeted the introduction of five new advanced technology products. Our introduction of the Blue Horizon technology brand formalizes our portfolio of advanced solutions for medium and heavy commercial vehicles. With our long history of technical innovation, the product pipeline we expect to bring to market has the potential to transform the value we deliver to customers. Our Blue Horizon brand represents a product portfolio that offers advanced efficiency, connectivity and electric solutions for our customers. It leverages our legacy as a proven partner, yet opens up new possibilities as we evolve. 
As the demand for efficiency continues to accelerate, we have developed, or are in the process of developing, several new products including:
•Dis-engageable tandem drive axle that provides the efficiency of a 6x2 with traction of 6x4
•Air disc brake positive pad retraction that eliminates drag for increased fuel economy and pad life
•Super-fast ratios that enable slower revolutions per minute ("RPM") at cruise speed for highway use (every 100 RPM reduced at speed translates to approximately 1% better fuel efficiency)
•Composite drivelines made of carbon fiber mesh with an overlay of fiberglass that can save up to 100 pounds or 45 kilograms over a standard driveline offering more cargo capacity and lessening the overall weight of the vehicle
•Advanced lube management system that uses electronics and pneumatics to manage critical axle components
We also believe connectivity offers many benefits to end users, vehicle manufacturers and Tier 1 suppliers like us. Similar to the increase in demand for smart home devices, our engineers are finding more areas where we can transform our offerings into smart products. The two main areas we are exploring include:
•Real time information to monitor and record product performance for various duty cycles
•Intelligent maintenance that provides sensors to notify of system health, required maintenance and overall vehicle efficiency
We are developing an electronic lube level monitoring device that eliminates the need for certain maintenance procedures saving time and money. For tire inflation, we are using sensors and related electronics that increase safety and improve efficiency via optimized tire pressure. And as manufacturers explore platooning, pairing and autonomous driving, knowing what is happening within the vehicle’s braking system is especially critical. The systems we are developing build upon our current pad wear sensor system and will monitor overall brake health, allowing strategic maintenance decisions as well as safer overall operation. 
Meritor’s expanding range of next-generation technologies includes comprehensive solutions for standard axles, remote- mount configurations and fully electric powertrain systems which furthers our goal of becoming the electric drivetrain supplier of choice. Our 14Xe™ ePowertrain is based on the proven 14X axle design which maintains existing axle mounting hardware for ease of OEM integration. The modular system enables the interchangeability of key components, including electric motors, transmissions, gearing, brakes, wheel ends and housings. The 14Xe™ is designed for scalability and can be adapted to fit various powertrain needs based on the vehicle application and duty cycle. This year, we announced an expansion of our electric drivetrain solutions by introducing the 12Xe™ powertrain for Class 4, 5, 6 and 7 applications and the 17Xe™ powertrain for heavy-duty 4x2 and 6x2 trucks.
This 14Xe™ ePowertrain is already receiving acclaims in the automotive industry. This year, we were recognized as a PACEpilot Honoree by Automotive News for our solutions to power Class 4 through 8 trucks and buses with electric powertrains instead of diesel-based systems, in addition to Diesel Progress’ Achievement of the Year and Electric Application of the Year awards.
To help us achieve our objectives in this important area, in fiscal year 2020 we acquired all outstanding common shares of Transportation Power, Inc. this year, a California-based company that supplies integrated drive systems, full electric truck solutions and energy-storage subsystems to major manufacturers of trucks, school buses, refuse vehicles and terminal tractors. Transportation Power has focused exclusively on developing electric drive solutions since its inception in 2010. With this acquisition, we advance our M2022 plan priorities through increased investment in next-generation technologies. 
Representing the first Class 8 production contract for electric drivetrains in the industry, we secured an agreement with PACCAR to be its non-exclusive supplier of ePowertrains for its Kenworth T680 and Peterbilt 579 and 520 battery-electric vehicles. We will be the initial launch partner and primary supplier for the integration of functional battery-electric systems on these refuse and heavy-duty chassis. Production is targeted to begin in 2021. We believe we will be the first supplier to begin production of electric powertrains for Class 8 electric vehicles, and we anticipate additional production contracts in 2021. 
Protect and Grow
We know that despite changes and volatility in global market conditions, it is important that we generate profitable top-line growth. We designed the M2022 plan to enable us to achieve the growth we are targeting while operating in a cyclical industry that can be greatly impacted by economic factors. We are increasing our market share with key customers, renewing long-term contracts and winning new business in all of our end markets around the globe across both of our reportable segments.
We expect to broaden our relationships with our global strategic customers, earn the business of new customers, increase aftermarket share in core product areas, expand our gear manufacturing, and enter near adjacent markets that we believe will be a good match with our core competencies.
We achieved major milestones in fiscal year 2020 related to next-generation technologies engineered to fit multiple vehicle applications for customers’ needs now and in the future. Through new business awards with global manufacturers and continued evolution of our Blue Horizon™ powertrain solutions, we are establishing Meritor as a leader in transformative technologies for the commercial vehicle industry. 
We have a clear view toward maintaining our leading market positions with best-in-class products and services. This year, we introduced new products, including our single piston air disc brake and a range of high efficiency axles which includes a vocational axle that is the first of its type in decades. 
We also signed a long-term agreement with Daimler. This contract that extends our relationship through 2027 and places Meritor in standard position for air disc brakes on the Freightliner Cascadia through 2025. Also in our core businesses, we have new contracts for on-highway and trailer axles, and a new award with Iveco Defence for a military application that will be deployed by the Dutch Department of Defense. Our operations in Australia were honored this year with Supplier of the Year awards from PACCAR and Penske, and our Aftermarket business celebrated production of the 100 millionth remanufactured brake shoe – a benchmark no other company has matched to date.
As industry trends continue to drive the need for equipment that complies with environmental and safety-related regulatory provisions, OEMs select suppliers based not only on the cost and quality of their products, but also on their ability to meet stringent environmental and safety requirements and to service and support the customer after the sale. We use our technological and market expertise to develop and engineer products that address mobility, safety, regulatory and environmental concerns. In fiscal year 2019, we published our first sustainability report to share the work we have done in the areas of advanced technologies; environment, health and safety; manufacturing initiatives; human capital, social responsibility and corporate governance, and we will publish an updated report later this year. 
Our commitment to designing and manufacturing braking solutions for the commercial vehicle market has resulted in more commercial vehicles in North America having Meritor brakes than brakes made by other brake manufacturer. We believe our EX+ air disc brakes are among the highest performing brakes in the marketplace. We recently announced the launch of our lightweight, single-piston EX+™ LS air disc brake, a next-generation braking solution designed and engineered for linehaul and trailer applications. This brake, which was recognized by Heavy Duty Trucking magazine as a Top 20 Product, will launch 
for trailers first, then trucks, in fiscal year 2021. With this brake, we are in standard position on Daimler’s Freightliner Cascadia through 2025.
We designed the EX+ LS air disc brake to meet fleet expectations for efficiency, safety and weight reduction. Built with exceptional taper wear control, the new air disc brake is designed and validated to perform like a twin-piston brake. Approximately 9 million of our air disc brakes are in operation globally.
We believe the quality of our core product lines, our ability to service our products through our aftermarket capabilities, and our sales and service support teams give us a competitive advantage. An important element of being a preferred supplier is the ability to deliver service through the entire lifecycle of the product. Also, as our industry becomes more international, our manufacturing footprint around the world and our ability to supply customers with regionally-tailored product solutions are competencies of increasing importance.
Exceed Customer Expectations
In addition to technology and product collaboration, we also meet regularly with our customers to review our performance in a number of other areas including quality, delivery and cost.
In our M2022 plan, we set an overall quality target of less than 20 parts per million ("PPM"). In fiscal year 2020, Meritor achieved a quality score of 36 PPM. We believe this level of quality further differentiates us in the commercial vehicle industry. Also this fiscal year, five of our facilities and three of our joint venture facilities received the Daimler Master of Quality Award. We also received Daimler's Supplier Award for outstanding performance in quality. During a peak North America commercial vehicle market in 2019, we supplied Daimler with 1.3 million axles, brakes and drivelines, all with a low defect rate based on PPM. We were honored to be recognized by Daimler, which has a global reputation for delivering quality products to its customers. 
In fiscal year 2020, we also continued our excellent OE delivery performance this year at 99 percent. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic globally and the challenges it created for the entire supply chain, we maintained a very high delivery rate. Our customers rely on us for this level of delivery performance and it differentiates us from our peers.
We will maintain our focus on driving down operating costs through material cost-reduction and labor and burden improvements with a target achievement of 2 percent improvement per year. We drive material performance with three different approaches: commercial negotiations, best-cost-country sourcing and technical innovation. And, we are improving in labor and burden by addressing several areas simultaneously, including better equipment utilization, reduced changeover time, elimination of waste, improved shift and asset utilization, investing in equipment to improve cycle time and flexibility and employee involvement.
We believe we effectively manage complexity for low volumes and support our customers’ needs during periods of peak volumes. The quality, durability and on-time delivery of our products has earned us strong positions in the markets we support. As we seek to extend and expand our business with existing customers and establish relationships with new ones, our objective is to ensure we are getting a fair value for the recognized benefits of our products and services and the strong brand equity we hold in the marketplace.
Enable the Business
COVID-19 Pandemic
There has never been a time in our company’s history when we were required to cease production at the vast majority of our manufacturing plants within days of each other as was required this year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To do this efficiently and safely required a great deal of collaboration and teamwork. These are the characteristics that Meritor employees are known for and were exemplified during this process.
The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was significant but when we were allowed to reopen our facilities, we took every action possible to protect our employees while still serving our role as an important part of the supply chain in maintaining the flow of commercial vehicle original equipment and aftermarket products, as well as products required for the manufacturing of specialty and defense vehicles.
We developed a Safe Start plan to protect our employees. It outlined specific policies that were audited at each of our sites including preventative measures in entry and common areas, heat mapping to identify areas that required modifications, 
personal protective equipment (PPE), wellness checks, visual indicators and the addition of social distance coaches. Safety is our first priority and we will take all necessary precautions to safeguard our employees – in each of our manufacturing plants, labs, distribution centers and offices. To ensure that we followed best practices across the industry, our general auditor assumed the additional role of Chief Safety Compliance Officer.
Every day, the safety of our employees is our top priority. Total case rate is a measure of recordable workplace injuries normalized per 100 employees per year. Our target under the M2022 plan is to achieve a case rate of less than 0.55. In fiscal year 2020, we achieved an overall total recordable case rate of 0.57 injuries per 200,000 hours worked, compared to 0.59 in the prior year. More than 50 percent of our facilities reported no recordable workplace injuries during fiscal year 2020. 
We believe that our strength to compete in the global market is dependent upon the engagement of every Meritor employee and that a high-performing team is critical to the level of performance we want to achieve. We have a strong and experienced leadership group and a committed team, both of which are focused on sustaining the strong foundation we built under the M2016 and M2019 plans. We will also continue to strengthen the diversity and inclusiveness of our workforce because we recognize the value of different opinions and backgrounds in a company as global as Meritor.
We have established various development and training programs to help our employees grow as we grow. For managers, we offer eLearning modules and courses that address important areas for advancement including accountability, delegation, and providing and receiving feedback. For certain director-level employees, we offer Leadership Edge - a program whose objective is to develop advanced leadership skills, prepare high-potential leaders for senior level positions and strengthen business acumen. And for certain senior-level leaders, we offer the Summit leadership development program, which provides executive coaching, the opportunity to attend specific executive training sessions tailored to each individual’s background and career goals, participation in a MBA-level finance course, if needed, and engagement in mentorship opportunities with a member of Meritor’s Board of Directors. To ensure we provide a rich experience for our employees, we will continue to measure employee engagement to build on the competencies that are important to our future.
Another objective in this area is to drive inclusiveness. We want to be leaders in this area. Executives facilitated focus groups this year with diverse employees and identified themes from those discussions that provided opportunities for improvement. Those themes were related to promotion and advancement, recruiting, and anti-discrimination. As a result, we are making the job posting process more transparent and ensuring that all internal applicants who are not selected for new positions receive feedback. We are also making changes to our hiring and recruitment practices with the intent to remove any bias from the resume-screening process and we are increasing the level of management oversight on hiring decisions. Longer term, we will refresh our unconscious bias training, develop a diversity mentor program, and explore fast-track programs for employees to ensure that we are retaining diverse talent and providing aggressive career tracks.

Axles, Suspension Systems & Drivelines

We believe we are one of the world's leading independent suppliers of axles for medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, with the leading market position in axle manufacturing in North America, South America and Europe, and are one of the major axle manufacturers in the Asia-Pacific region. Our extensive truck axle product line includes a wide range of front steer axles and rear drive axles. Our front steer and rear drive axles can be equipped with our cam, wedge or air disc brakes, automatic slack adjusters, and complete wheel-end equipment such as hubs, rotors and drums.
We supply heavy-duty axles in certain global regions for use in numerous off-highway vehicle applications, including construction, material handling, and mining. We also supply axles for use in military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America and Europe. These products are designed to tolerate high tonnage and operate under extreme conditions. We also supply axles for use in buses, coaches and recreational vehicles, fire trucks and other specialty vehicles in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe, and we believe we are a leading supplier of bus and coach axles in North America.

We are one of the major manufacturers of heavy-duty trailer axles in North America. Our trailer axles are available in more than 40 models in capacities from 20,000 to 30,000 pounds for virtually all heavy trailer applications and are available with our broad range of suspension modules and brake products, including drum brakes and disc brakes.

We supply universal joints and driveline components, including our Permalube™ universal joint and RPL Permalube™ driveline, which are maintenance free, permanently lubricated designs used often in the high mileage on-highway market. We supply drivelines in North America for use in numerous on-highway vehicle applications. We also supply transfer cases for use in specialty vehicles in North America, Turkey and Europe. In addition, we supply trailer air suspension systems and products with an increasing market presence in North America. We supply transfer cases and drivelines for use in military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America and Europe. In addition, we also supply advanced suspension modules for use in light-, medium- and heavy-duty military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America, Turkey and Europe.

Brakes and Brake-Related Components

We believe we are one of the leading independent suppliers of air brakes to medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle manufacturers in North America and Europe. In Brazil, we believe that Master Sistemas Automotivos Limitada, our 49%-owned joint venture with Randon S. A. Implementos e Participações, is a leading supplier of brakes and brake-related products.
 Through manufacturing facilities located in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe, we manufacture a broad range of foundation air brakes, as well as automatic slack adjusters for brake systems. Our foundation air brake products include cam drum brakes, which offer improved lining life and tractor/trailer interchangeability; wedge drum brakes, which are lightweight and provide automatic internal wear adjustment; air disc brakes, which provide enhanced stopping distance and improved fade resistance for demanding applications; and wheel-end components such as hubs, drums and rotors.

Our brakes and brake system components are used in military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America, Turkey and Europe. We supply brakes for use in buses, coaches and recreational vehicles, fire trucks and other specialty vehicles in North America and Europe, and we believe we are the leading supplier of bus and coach brakes in North America. We also supply brakes for commercial vehicles, buses and coaches in Asia Pacific and air and hydraulic brakes for off-highway vehicles in North America and Europe.
Electric Vehicle and Other Products

We supply electric drive systems that include an electric motor and inverter, power electronics, battery pack, electrified accessories, and all associated software and controls for terminal tractors and medium and heavy-duty trucks and buses.
In addition to the products discussed above, we sell other complementary products, including third-party and private label items, through our aftermarket distribution channels. These products are generally sold under master distribution or similar agreements with outside vendors and include brake shoes and friction materials; automatic slack adjusters; yokes and shafts; wheel-end hubs and drums; ABS and stability control systems; shock absorbers and air springs; and air brakes.
Customers; Sales and Marketing

We have numerous customers worldwide and have developed long-standing business relationships with many of these customers. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 69 percent of our total sales in fiscal year 2020. Sales to customers that accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales in fiscal year 2020 included AB Volvo, Daimler AG and PACCAR, representing approximately 21 percent, 17 percent and 12 percent, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales in fiscal year 2020.
 Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)

In North America, we design, engineer, market and sell products principally to OEMs, dealers and distributors. While our North American sales are typically direct to OEMs, our ultimate commercial truck customers include trucking and transportation fleets. Fleet customers may specify our components and integrated systems for installation in the vehicles they purchase from OEMs. We employ what we refer to as a "push-pull" marketing strategy. We "push" for being the standard product at the OEM. At the same time, our district field managers then call on fleets and OEM dealers to "pull-through" our components on specific truck purchases. For all other markets, we specifically design, engineer, market and sell products principally to OEMs for their market-specific needs or product specifications.

For certain large OEM customers, our supply arrangements are negotiated on a long-term contract basis for a multi-year period that may require us to provide annual cost reductions through price reductions or other cost benefits for the OEMs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cost savings in the future to offset such price reductions, our gross margins will be adversely affected. Sales to other OEMs are typically made through open order releases or purchase orders at market-based prices that do not require the purchase of a minimum number of products. The customer typically has the right to cancel or delay these orders on reasonable notice. We typically compete to either retain business or try to win new business from OEMs when long-term contracts expire. 

We have established leading positions in many of the markets we serve as a global supplier of a broad range of drivetrain systems, brakes and components. Based on available industry data and internal company estimates, our market-leading positions include independent truck drive axles (i.e., those manufactured by an independent, non-captive supplier) in North America, Europe, South America and India through a joint venture; truck drivelines in North America; truck air brakes in North America and South America (through a joint venture); and military wheeled vehicle drivetrains, suspensions and brakes in North America.

Our global customer portfolio includes AB Volvo, Daimler AG, PACCAR, Navistar International Corporation, Oshkosh, Traton Group, CNH Industrial, Ashok Leyland, XCMG, Wabash National, and Gillig.

Aftermarket

We market and sell truck, trailer, off-highway and other products principally to, and service such products principally for, OEMs, their parts marketing operations, their dealers and other independent distributors and service garages within the aftermarket industry. Our product sales are generated through long-term agreements with certain of our OEM customers and distribution agreements and sales to independent dealers and distributors. Sales to other OEMs are typically made through open order releases or purchase orders at market-based prices, which do not require the purchase of a minimum number of products. The customer typically has the right to cancel or delay these orders on reasonable notice.

Our product offerings allow us to service all stages of our customers’ vehicle ownership lifecycle. In North America, we stock and distribute thousands of parts from top national brands to our customers or what we refer to as our "all makes" strategy. Our district field managers call on our OEM's, OEM dealers, fleet customers and independent customers to market our full product line capabilities on a regular basis to seek to ensure that we satisfy our customers’ needs. Our aftermarket business sells products under the following brand names: Meritor, Euclid, Trucktechnic, US Gear, AxleTech and Mach.

Based on available industry data and internal company estimates, we believe our North America aftermarket business has the overall market leadership position for the portfolio of products that we offer. 

Competition

We compete worldwide with a number of North American and international providers of components and systems, some of which are owned by or associated with some of our customers. The principal competitive factors are price, quality, service, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation and timely delivery. Certain OEMs manufacture their own components that compete with the types of products we supply.

Our major competitors for axles are Dana Incorporated and, in certain markets, OEMs that manufacture axles for use in their own products. Emerging competitors for axles include DTNA’s Detroit Axle, Allison, ZF Friedrichshafen in Europe, and Hande, Fuwa and Ankai in China. Our major competitors for brakes are Bendix/Knorr Bremse, ZF and, in certain markets, OEMs that manufacture brakes for use in their own products. Our major competitors for industrial applications are MAN, Oshkosh, AM General, Marmon-Herrington, Dana Incorporated, Knorr Bremse, Kessler & Co., Carraro, NAF, Sisu and, in certain markets, OEMs that manufacture industrial products for use in their own vehicles. Our major competitors for trailer applications are Fuwa, Hendrickson and SAF-Holland.
Raw Materials and Suppliers

Our purchases of raw materials and parts are concentrated over a limited number of suppliers. We are dependent upon our suppliers’ ability to meet cost performance targets, quality specifications and delivery schedules. The inability of a supplier to meet these requirements, the loss of a significant supplier, or work stoppages could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customers’ delivery requirements.
The cost of our core products is susceptible to changes in overall steel commodity prices, including ingredients used for various grades of steel. We have generally structured our major steel supplier and customer contracts to absorb and pass on normal index-related market fluctuations in steel prices. While we have had steel pricing adjustment programs in place with most major OEMs, the price adjustment programs tend to lag behind the movement in steel costs and have generally not contemplated non-steel index related increases. 
Significant future volatility in the commodity markets or a deterioration in product demand may require us to pursue customer price increases through surcharges or other pricing arrangements. In addition, if suppliers are inadequate for our needs, or if prices remain at current levels or increase and we are unable to either pass these prices to our customer base or otherwise mitigate the costs, our operating results could be further adversely affected.
We continuously work to address these competitive challenges by reducing costs and, as needed, restructuring operations. We manage supplier risk by conducting periodic assessments for all major suppliers and more frequent rigorous assessments of high-risk suppliers. On an ongoing basis, we monitor third-party financial statements, conduct surveys through supplier questionnaires, and conduct site visits. We have developed a supplier improvement process where we identify and develop actions to address ongoing financial, quality and delivery issues to further mitigate potential risk. We are proactive in managing our supplier relationships to avoid supply disruption. Our process employs dual sourcing and resourcing trigger points that cause us to take aggressive actions and then monitor the progress closely. 
Acquisitions, Divestitures and Restructuring

As described above, our business strategies are focused on enhancing our market position by continuously evaluating the competitive differentiation of our product portfolio, focusing on our strengths and core competencies, and growing the businesses that offer the most attractive returns. Implementing these strategies involves various types of strategic initiatives.
Acquisitions and divestitures are discussed in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Restructuring actions are discussed in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Joint Ventures

As the industries in which we operate have become more globalized, joint ventures and other cooperative arrangements have become an important element of our business strategies. These strategic alliances provide for sales, product design, development and manufacturing in certain product and geographic areas. As of September 30, 2020, our continuing operations participated in the following non-consolidated joint ventures:

 | Key Products | Country
Master Sistemas Automotivos Limitada | Braking systems | Brazil 
Sistemas Automotrices de Mexico S.A. de C.V. | Axles, drivelines and brakes | Mexico 
Ege Fren Sanayii ve Ticaret A.S. | Braking systems | Turkey 
Automotive Axles Limited | Rear drive axle assemblies and braking systems | India 

Aggregate sales of our non-consolidated joint ventures were $696 million, $1,231 million and $1,101 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial position and operating results of those joint ventures in which we have control. For additional information on our unconsolidated joint ventures and percentage ownership thereof see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below. 
Research and Development

We have significant research, development, engineering and product design capabilities. We spent $74 million in fiscal year 2020, $75 million in fiscal year 2019 and $73 million in fiscal year 2018 on company-sponsored research, development and engineering. We employ professional engineers and scientists globally and have additional engineering capabilities through contract arrangements in low-cost countries. We also have advanced technical centers in North America, South America, Europe and India. 
Patents and Trademarks 

We own or license many United States and foreign patents and patent applications in our engineering and manufacturing operations and other activities. While in the aggregate these patents and licenses are considered important to the operation of our businesses, management does not believe that the loss or termination of any one of them would materially affect a business segment or Meritor as a whole.

Our registered trademarks for Meritor® and the Bull design are important to our business. Other significant trademarks owned by us include Euclid® and Trucktechnic® for aftermarket products.

Substantially all of our U.S.-held intellectual property rights are subject to a first-priority perfected security interest securing our obligations to the lenders under our credit facility. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below. 
Employees

At September 30, 2020, we had approximately 8,600 employees composed of approximately 7,200 hourly and salaried employees, 780 employees from our joint ventures, and 620 other employees. At September 30, 2020, 68 employees in the United States were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Most of our facilities outside of the United States and Canada are unionized. We strive to foster and maintain positive relationships with our employees. 
We believe that our ability to compete in the global market depends on the engagement of every one of our employees, and that a high-performing team is critical to the level of performance we want to achieve. By maintaining relationships with leading universities, we are able to identify and recruit top talent. In order to attract the best candidates, we offer market competitive compensation and benefits around the globe, annual incentive programs for salaried and hourly employees, long-term incentive programs for executives and health and wellness benefits. To retain top talent, we encourage professional 
development through internal and external training opportunities, in addition to a leadership fundamentals program for managers, the Leadership Edge program for high potential leaders and the Summit for senior level leaders. 
To ensure we provide a rich experience for our employees, we measure organizational culture and engagement to build on the competencies that are important for our future success. We routinely engage independent third parties to conduct cultural and employee engagement surveys. These include corporate culture assessments, as well as real-time feedback on employee engagement and a holistic approach survey on employee well-being focused on physical, emotional, social and financial health. 
In addition, we aim to diversify our workforce because we recognize the value of engaging different opinions and backgrounds in a global company. We are committed to recruiting, developing and retaining a high-performing and diverse workforce. We are in the process of initiating a mentoring program for diverse employees, implementing various recruitment initiatives, refreshing mandatory unconscious bias training, targeting efforts to attract qualified women and underrepresented minorities for positions at all levels of the company and employee led resource groups, including the African American Resource Group, the Women’s Employee Resource Group and the LGBT Resource Group.
Environmental Matters

Environmental matters are discussed in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The process of estimating environmental liabilities is complex and dependent on physical and scientific data at the site, uncertainties as to remedies and technologies to be used, and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies. The actual amount of costs or damages for which we may be held responsible could materially exceed our current estimates because of uncertainties, including the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties, the success of the remediation and other factors that make it difficult to predict actual costs accurately. However, based on management's assessment, after consulting with Meritor's Chief Legal Officer and with outside advisors who specialize in environmental matters, and subject to the difficulties inherent in estimating these future costs, we believe that our expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, in future periods, new laws and regulations, changes in remediation plans, advances in technology and additional information about the ultimate clean-up remedy could significantly change our estimates. Management cannot assess the possible impact of compliance with future requirements.
Seasonality; Cyclicality

We may experience seasonal variations in the demand for our products, to the extent OEM vehicle production fluctuates. Historically, for most of our operations, demand has been somewhat lower in the quarters ended September 30 and December 31, when OEM plants may close for summer shutdowns and holiday periods or when there are fewer selling days during the quarter. Our aftermarket business and our operations in India generally experience seasonally higher demand in the quarter ending March 31.

In addition, the industries in which we operate have been characterized historically by periodic fluctuations in overall demand for trucks, trailers and other specialty vehicles for which we supply products, resulting in corresponding fluctuations in demand for our products. Production and sales of the vehicles for which we supply products generally depend on economic conditions and a variety of other factors that are outside of our control, including freight tonnage, customer spending and preferences, vehicle age, labor relations and regulatory requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors below. Cycles in the major vehicle industry markets of North America and Europe are not necessarily concurrent or related but do tend to be correlated to general economic trends. 
See Trends and Uncertainties in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis for estimated commercial truck production volumes for selected original equipment markets based on available sources and management's estimates.
