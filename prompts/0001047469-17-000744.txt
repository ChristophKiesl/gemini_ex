     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
     GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS 
        Abbott Laboratories is an Illinois corporation, incorporated in 1900. Abbott's* principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad and diversified line of health care products. 
      FINANCIAL INFORMATION RELATING TO INDUSTRY SEGMENTS, GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND CLASSES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS 
        Incorporated herein by reference is Note 15 entitled "Segment and Geographic Area Information" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
      NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
        As of December 31, 2016, Abbott had four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Vascular Products. 
         On January 4, 2017, Abbott completed the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical), a global medical device manufacturer, for approximately $23.6 billion, including approximately $13.6 billion in cash and approximately $10 billion in Abbott common shares, based on the closing Abbott share price on the acquisition date. Because the acquisition was completed during 2017, the financial condition and results of operations presented herein are those of Abbott and its subsidiaries prior to the completion of the acquisition, and do not include the financial conditions and results of operations of St. Jude Medical and its subsidiaries. 
         On September 14, 2016, Abbott entered into a definitive agreement to sell its surgical cataract treatment, surgical vision correction and consumer eye health businesses to Johnson & Johnson for $4.325 billion in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments for cash, debt and working capital. The transaction reflects Abbott's proactive shaping of its portfolio in line with its strategic priorities. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. 
         On January 30, 2016, Abbott entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Alere Inc. (Alere), a diagnostic device and service provider, for $56.00 per common share in cash. The acquisition is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the accuracy of Alere's representations and warranties (subject to certain materiality qualifications), compliance in all material respects with Alere's covenants and receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. Due to a number of adverse developments that have occurred with respect to Alere since the date of the merger agreement, Abbott has filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking to terminate the merger agreement on the basis that Alere has experienced a "material adverse effect" under the acquisition agreement and has materially breached certain of its covenants. See Item 3, "Legal Proceedings." 
         On February 27, 2015, Abbott completed the sale of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business, which was previously included in the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, to Mylan Inc. for 110 million shares of Mylan N.V., a newly formed entity that combined Mylan's existing business with Abbott's developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business. Abbott retained the branded generics pharmaceuticals business and products of its Established Pharmaceutical Products segment in emerging markets. In April 2015, Abbott sold 40,250,000 of its Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. Abbott currently owns 69,750,000 Mylan N.V. ordinary shares.

  Established Pharmaceutical Products 
         These products include a broad line of branded generic pharmaceuticals manufactured worldwide and marketed and sold outside the United States. These products are generally sold directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, pharmacies, and independent retailers from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with, or licensed from, other companies. 
         The principal products included in the broad therapeutic area portfolios of the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment are:
 

 gastroenterology products, including Creon®, for the treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency associated with several
underlying conditions, including cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis; Duspatal® and Dicetel®, for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome or biliary spasm;
Heptral®, Transmetil®, and Samyr®, for the treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis (associated with liver disease) or depressive symptoms; and Duphalac®,
for regulation of the physiological rhythm of the colon;

         The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment directs its primary marketing efforts toward building a strong brand with key stakeholders, including consumers, pharmacists, physicians, and other healthcare providers. Government agencies are also important customers. 
         Competition in the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment is generally from other health care and pharmaceutical companies. In addition, the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed and introduction of additional forms of already marketed established products by generic or branded competitors have increased competitive pressures. 
   Diagnostic Products 
         These products include a broad line of diagnostic systems and tests manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, clinics, physicians' offices, government agencies, alternate care testing sites, and plasma protein therapeutic companies from Abbott owned distribution centers, public warehouses or third party distributors. 
         The principal products included in the Diagnostic Products segment are:
 

 immunoassay and clinical chemistry systems, including ARCHITECT®, ABBOTT PRISM®, and the next-generation
Alinity family of instruments, with assays used for screening and/or diagnosis for cancer, cardiac, metabolics, drugs of abuse, fertility, general chemistries, infectious diseases such as
hepatitis and HIV, and therapeutic drug monitoring; 

 2

  

 a full line of hematology systems and reagents known as the Cell-Dyn® series; 
 the i-STAT® and next-generation i-STAT Alinity point-of-care diagnostic systems and cartridges for blood analysis; 
 m2000, an instrument that automates the extraction, purification, and preparation of DNA and RNA from patient samples, and detects
and measures infectious agents including HIV, HBV, HCV, HPV, and CT/NG; 
 the Vysis® FISH product line of genomic-based tests, including the PathVysion® HER-2 DNA probe kit; the
UroVysion® bladder cancer recurrence kit; and the Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit, an FDA-approved companion diagnostic to Pfizer's approved non-small-cell lung cancer therapy
XALKORI®; and 
 informatics and automation solutions for use in laboratories, including ACCELERATOR a3600®, and AlinIQ, a suite of

         The Diagnostic Products segment's products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, instrument warranty provisions, product performance, laboratory efficiency, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products. 
   Nutritional Products 
         These products include a broad line of pediatric and adult nutritional products manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to consumers and to institutions, wholesalers, retailers, health care facilities, government agencies, and third-party distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers or third-party distributors. 
         The principal products included in the Nutritional Products segment are:
 

 various forms of prepared infant formula and follow-on formula, including Similac®, Similac® Pro-Advance®,
Similac® Advance®, Similac® Advance® Non-GMO, Similac Pro-Sensitive, Similac Sensitive®, Similac Sensitive®
Non-GMO, Go&Grow by Similac, Similac® NeoSure®, Similac Organic®, Similac® Special Care®, Similac Total Comfort,
Similac® For Supplementation, Isomil® Advance®, Isomil®, Alimentum®, Gain®, Grow®, Similac Qinti, and
Eleva; 
 adult and other pediatric nutritional products, including Ensure®, Ensure Plus®, Ensure®
Enlive®, Ensure® (with NutriVigor®), Ensure Complete®, Ensure® High Protein, Glucerna®, Glucerna Hunger Smart®,
ProSure®, PediaSure®, PediaSure Sidekicks®, PediaSure Peptide®, EleCare®, Juven®, Abound®, and
Pedialyte®; 
 nutritional products used in enteral feeding in health care institutions, including Jevity®, Glucerna® 1.2 Cal,
Glucerna® 1.5 Cal, Osmolite®, Oxepa®, Freego® (Enteral Pump) and Freego® sets, Nepro®, and Vital®; and 
 Zone Perfect® bars and the EAS® family of nutritional brands, including Myoplex® and
AdvantEdge®. 

         Primary marketing efforts for nutritional products are directed toward consumers or to securing the recommendation of Abbott's brand of products by physicians or other health care professionals. In addition, certain nutritional products sold as Similac®, Gain®, Grow®, Eleva, PediaSure®, PediaSure Sidekicks®, Pedialyte®, Ensure®, Zone Perfect®, EAS®/Myoplex®, and Glucerna® are also promoted directly to the public by consumer marketing efforts in select markets where appropriate.

          Competition for nutritional products in the segment is generally from other diversified consumer and health care manufacturers. Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, intellectual property, price, retail distribution, and availability of product forms. A significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations. The introduction of new products by competitors, changes in medical practices and procedures, and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers' products may increase competitive pressure. 
   Vascular Products 
         These products include a broad line of coronary, endovascular, vessel closure, and structural heart devices for the treatment of vascular disease that are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide. In the United States, these products are generally marketed and sold directly to hospitals from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. 
         The principal products included in the Vascular Products segment are:
 

 the XIENCE family of drug-eluting coronary stent systems developed on the Multi-Link Vision® platform; 
 StarClose SE® and ProGlide vessel closure devices; 
 TREK® coronary balloon dilatation products; 
 Hi-Torque Balance Middleweight Universal and ASAHI® coronary guidewires (licensed from Asahi
Intecc Co., Ltd.); 
 MitraClip®, a percutaneous mitral valve repair system; 
 Supera® Peripheral Stent System, a peripheral vascular stent system; and 
 Acculink®/Accunet® and Xact®/Emboshield NAV, carotid stent systems. 

         The products in Abbott's Vascular Products segment are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, product performance, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products. 
         On January 4, 2017, Abbott completed the acquisition of St. Jude Medical. St. Jude Medical's products include a broad line of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders.

These products are marketed worldwide and generally sold directly to wholesalers, government agencies, private health care organizations, health care facilities, mail order pharmacies, and independent retailers from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Some of these products are marketed and distributed through distributors. Blood and flash glucose monitoring systems, contact lens care products, and dry eye products are also marketed and sold to consumers. These products are subject to regulatory changes and competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, and product performance. 
         As discussed above, Abbott has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its surgical cataract treatment, surgical vision correction and consumer eye health businesses to Johnson & Johnson. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017. 
      INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ABBOTT'S BUSINESS IN GENERAL 
  Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
         Abbott purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to Abbott's operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and around the world. There have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages for raw materials or supplies. 
 Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses 
         Abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products. Accordingly, where possible, patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for Abbott's products in the United States and countries of interest to Abbott. Abbott owns or has licenses under a substantial number of patents and patent applications. Principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the Narrative Description of Business on pages 1 through 5. These, and various patents which expire during the period 2017 to 2037, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance in the operation of Abbott's business. Abbott believes that no single patent, license, or trademark is material in relation to Abbott's business as a whole. 
 Seasonal Aspects, Customers, Backlog, and Renegotiation 
         There are no significant seasonal aspects to Abbott's business. Abbott has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on Abbott. Orders for Abbott's products are generally filled on a current basis, and order backlog is not material to Abbott's business. No material portion of Abbott's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government.

    Research and Development 
         Abbott spent approximately $1.4 billion in 2016, $1.4 billion in 2015, and $1.3 billion in 2014 on research to discover and develop new products and processes and to improve existing products and processes. 
 Environmental Matters 
         Abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. Abbott's capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2016 were approximately $19 million and $35 million, respectively. Capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2017 are estimated to be $19 million and $38 million, respectively. 
         Abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which are owned by Abbott, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, Abbott believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. 
   Employees 
         Abbott employed approximately 75,000 people as of December 31, 2016. Following the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Abbott employs approximately 94,000 people. 
   Regulation 
         The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of Abbott's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar international regulatory agencies. Government regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott's products, as well as the inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, supply chains, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices. Abbott's international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries. These may require local investment, restrict Abbott's investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products. In addition, Abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees. Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights. 
         Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott's business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority 
 6

  necessary for a product's production and sale, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. 
         Abbott's business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. 
         Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in many countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payors and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. Abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products. Many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on Abbott's products for the foreseeable future. 
         In the United States, the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical procedures in which medical devices and diagnostics may be used. The government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home, and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare also implemented a competitive bidding system for durable medical equipment (including diabetes products), enteral nutrition products, and supplies. Additionally, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act establishes a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests, which goes into effect in 2018. 
         In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), imposed an excise tax on Abbott and other medical device manufacturers and importers. The excise tax was subsequently suspended from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. The excise tax is scheduled to apply to sales of taxable medical devices beginning on January 1, 2018. 
         The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. 
         Policy changes, including potential modification or repeal of all or parts of the Affordable Care Act or implementation of new health care legislation, could result in significant changes to the health care system. 
         The regulation of data privacy and security, and the protection of the confidentiality of certain patient health information, is increasing. For example, the European Union has enacted stricter data protection laws, which will take effect in 2018, that contain enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance. Similarly, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules governing the use, disclosure, and 
 7

  security of protected health information, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued further guidance concerning data security for medical devices. In addition, certain countries have issued or are considering "data localization" laws, which limit companies' ability to transfer protected data across country borders. Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties. Transferring and managing protected health information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended, and Abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area. 
         Governmental cost containment efforts also affect Abbott's nutritional products business. In the United States, for example, under regulations governing the federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula. As a result, through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program. 
         Abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, manufacture, availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services, as well as data privacy and security. Abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical, nutrition, diagnostic, and medical device industries, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. 
      INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS 
        As discussed in greater detail in the section captioned, "Narrative Description of Business," Abbott markets products worldwide through affiliates and distributors. Most of the products discussed in the preceding sections of this report are also sold outside the United States. In addition, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines to meet local regulatory requirements and marketing preferences are manufactured and marketed to customers outside the United States. International operations are subject to certain additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action.
