OUR CLIENTS AND INDUSTRIES
We provide professional services to a wide variety of both financially sound and distressed organizations, including healthcare organizations, leading academic and research institutions, Fortune 500 and mid-sized companies, and governmental entities. In 2016, we served over 1,000 clients, including over 400 new clients. 
Our clients are in a broad array of industries, including healthcare, education, pharmaceutical and medical device, financial services, energy and utilities, retail, aerospace, automotive, technology, telecommunications, consumer products, governmental, metals and mining, engineering and construction, hospitality and gaming, logistics, and manufacturing.
EMPLOYEES
Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain, and develop highly talented professionals by creating a work environment where both employees and teams thrive and individuals are rewarded not only for their own contributions but also for the success of our organization. To accomplish these goals and recognize high performance, we have developed comprehensive employee programs incorporating training and development opportunities, competitive compensation, performance management, benefits, and wellness, as well as corporate social responsibility, facilitated through our Huron Helping Hands program and the diversity and inclusion council.
Our employee population is divided into two groups: client-serving and support. As of December 31, 2016, we had 2,818 full-time employees, including 129 client-serving managing directors. Our client-serving employees serve as critical business advisors collaborating with clients to help solve their most complex business problems. Our managing directors are the key drivers of growth in our business, generating new revenue streams from existing and new clients. They help enhance our market reputation by partnering with clients as advisors and engagement team leaders. Internally, they create our intellectual capital, develop our people, and foster our culture. Our senior directors, directors, and managers manage day-to-day client relationships and oversee the delivery and quality of our work product. Our associates and analysts gather and organize data, conduct detailed analyses, and prepare presentations that synthesize and distill information to support recommendations we deliver to clients. Our support employees include our senior management team as well as professionals who provide sales support, methodology creation, software development, and corporate functions consisting of our facilities, finance and accounting, human resources, information technology, legal, and marketing teams. These employees provide strategic direction and support that enables the success of our client-serving employees. At December 31, 2016, our support team was led by 23 managing directors, executives, and corporate vice presidents.
In addition to our full-time client-serving employees, we engage contractors on an as-needed basis to provide highly unique skill sets that are not required to be staffed on a full-time basis. 
Supporting our professionals' career progression is critical to our employee retention and engagement. Our learning and organizational effectiveness team facilitates structured orientation and training curriculum for new campus hires and experienced employees to help develop and integrate them more effectively into the Company. Leadership professional development programs are offered to recently promoted employees to support their transition to and success in a new role with broader responsibility. In addition to these milestone programs, we offer a variety of leadership development programs for those we deem capable of taking on broader roles in the organization at the senior director and managing director level. We also provide a variety of continuing education opportunities to all of our employees,

including formal classroom environments, on-line courses, and webinars to further develop employees’ technical knowledge, skill sets and ability to work collaboratively and coach others. We encourage our employees to enhance their professional skills through outside courses that certify their technical skills and to pursue certain advanced degrees. Employees are assigned internal performance coaches to help them establish expectations that are reviewed quarterly, including identifying opportunities for professional development, formal training, and technical skill certifications.
Our compensation philosophy focuses on rewarding and retaining our high performing employees. To accomplish this, we offer employees a competitive base salary, performance incentives, and benefits.
Our incentive compensation plan is designed to recognize and reward performance of both the organization and individuals and to ensure we properly recognize and retain our top performers. We take both practice and Company financial performance into consideration in the determination of bonus pool funding. At the practice level, the annual bonus pool is funded based on achievement of its annual financial goals. The board of directors then reviews and approves the total incentive compensation pool for all practices in the context of the Company’s overall financial performance. Individual bonus awards are based on the practice’s financial performance, individual bonus targets, and the individual’s performance as evaluated through our performance management process. The intent of the incentive compensation plan is to differentiate rewards based on individual performance, ensuring that our top performers for the year receive incentives that are commensurate with their contributions, enabling us to retain them and continue to provide our clients with exceptional service. The incentive compensation plan for our named executive officers is funded based on a blend of achievement of financial goals and strategic initiatives.
Managing directors’ individual compensation levels, including base salary and target incentive awards, are set to align with the value of their expected contributions to the organization. As the key drivers of the organization’s success, their compensation is designed to include equity awards as a core component. The use of equity is intended to encourage retention, align the interests of our managing directors with shareholders, and help build wealth over a managing director's career at Huron through annual grants as well as stock price appreciation.
Our benefit and wellness programs are designed to be both comprehensive and tailored to our employee population. Our paid time off policy allows for flexibility and our travel reward program recognizes the significant travel commitment of our workforce. Our wellness benefits are aimed at supporting our employees in maintaining a healthy lifestyle which is beneficial to the employee and the Company, given the demanding nature of the work. Through these unique benefits, as well as our health and welfare plans, retirement benefits, stock purchase plan, and other standard benefit programs, we provide a core sense of security to our employees.
Our corporate social responsibility efforts are designed to support an individual’s charitable interests while also providing a venue for our employees to come together to make an impact in the communities in which we live and work. In addition, the diversity and inclusion council supports the needs of our growing employee population through employee resource groups that provide corporate-wide educational opportunities, build awareness, celebrate our differences, develop mentoring relationships, and ensure we are fostering a welcoming and nurturing environment for all employees. 
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING
Our business development and marketing activities are aimed at cultivating relationships, driving demand, generating leads, and building a strong brand reputation with hospital, health system, and university administrators; offices of the C-suite; and senior level influencers and decision makers of middle market and large corporate organizations. We believe excellent service delivery to clients is critical to building and maintaining relationships and our brand reputation, and we emphasize the importance of client service to all of our employees.
Currently, we generate most of our new business opportunities through the combination of relationships our managing directors have with individuals working in hospitals and health systems, academic and research institutions, and corporations, and marketing lead generation activities. We also view cross-selling as a key component in building our business. Often, the client relationship of a managing director in one area of our business leads to opportunities in another area. All of our managing directors understand their roles in ongoing relationship and business development, which is reinforced through our compensation and incentive programs. We actively seek to identify new business opportunities and frequently receive referrals and repeat business from past and current clients. In addition, to complement the business development efforts of our managing directors, we have dedicated business development professionals who are focused exclusively on developing client relationships and generating new business.
COMPETITION
The professional services industry is extremely competitive, highly fragmented, and constantly evolving. The industry includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise, including other strategy, business operations, technology, and financial consulting firms; general management consulting firms; the consulting practices of major accounting firms; technical and economic advisory firms; regional and specialty consulting firms; and the internal professional resources of organizations. We compete with a large number of service and technology providers in all of our segments. Our competitors vary, depending on the particular practice area, and we expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants.

We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include reputation, the ability to attract and retain top talent, and the capacity to manage engagements effectively to drive high value to clients. There is also competition on price, although to a lesser extent due to the criticality of the issues that many of our services address. Some competitors have a greater geographic footprint, broader international presence, and more resources than we do, but we believe our reputation and ability to deliver high-value, quality service and measurable results to our clients across a balanced portfolio of services and attract and retain employees with broad capabilities and deep industry expertise enable us to compete favorably in the professional services marketplace.
