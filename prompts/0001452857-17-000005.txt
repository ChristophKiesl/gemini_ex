The Company
Steel Partners, a private investment firm, was founded in February 1990 by Warren G. Lichtenstein. In December 2008, in order to preserve an investment strategy that successfully served the investment firm and its investors since inception, Steel Partners restructured its business. The result was the creation of Steel Partners Holdings L.P. ("SPLP" or the "Company"), a limited partnership formed in the State of Delaware on December 16, 2008. On April 10, 2012, after fulfilling stringent regulatory and financial reporting requirements, the Company became listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: SPLP).
SPLP is a diversified global holding company that engages in multiple businesses through consolidated subsidiaries, associated companies and other interests. It owns and operates businesses, and has significant investments in companies, in various industries, including diversified industrial products, energy, defense, supply chain management and logistics, banking, and youth sports. SPLP operates through the following segments: Diversified Industrial, Energy, Financial Services, and Corporate and Other. Each of our companies has its own management team with significant experience in their industries. Our subsidiary, Steel Services Ltd (''Steel Services''), through management services agreements, provides services to us and some of our companies which include assignment of C-Level management personnel, legal, tax, accounting, treasury, consulting, auditing, administrative, compliance, environmental health and safety, human resources, marketing, investor relations, operating group management and other similar services. We work with our businesses to increase corporate value over the long term for all stakeholders by implementing our unique strategy discussed in more detail below.
SPLP is managed by SP General Services LLC (the "Manager"), pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated management agreement (the "Management Agreement") discussed in further detail in Note 19 â€“ "Related Party Transactions" to the SPLP consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. From its founding in 1990, the Manager and its affiliates have focused on increasing value for investors in the entities it has managed. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Steel Partners Holdings GP Inc., formerly known as Web LLC and Steel Partners Holdings GP LLC (the "General Partner"), is our general partner. The General Partner converted from a limited liability company to a corporation on September 21, 2010. The General Partner has a board of directors (the "Board of Directors"). The Board of Directors is currently comprised of seven members, five of whom are elected annually by our unitholders and two of whom are appointed by the Manager. Warren G.

The Joining Materials business offers these metal joining products in a wide variety of alloys, including gold, silver, palladium, copper, nickel, aluminum and tin. Operating income from precious metal products is principally derived from the "value-added" of processing and fabricating and not from the purchase and resale of precious metals.

WebBank originates and funds consumer and small business loans through lending programs with unaffiliated companies that market and service the programs ("Marketing Partners"), where the Marketing Partners subsequently purchase the loans (or interests in the loans) that are originated by WebBank. WebBank also has private-label financing programs that are branded for a specific retailer, manufacturer, dealer channel, proprietary network and bank card programs. WebBank participates in syndicated commercial and industrial as well as asset based credit facilities and asset based securitizations through relationships with other financial institutions. 
Business Strategy
We continuously evaluate the retention and disposition of existing operations and investigate possible acquisitions of new businesses, often focusing on businesses that are selling substantially below intrinsic value. We consider possible synergies and economies of scale in operating and/or making determinations to acquire or dispose of companies. We seek additional means to reduce costs and to encourage integration of operations and the building of business relationships among our companies, consistent with our desire that our unitholders benefit from the diversified holding company structure.
We strive to enhance the business operations of our companies and increase long-term value for unitholders and stakeholders through balance sheet improvements, strategic allocation of capital and operational and growth initiatives. We use a set of tools and processes called the Steel Business System to drive operational and commercial efficiencies across each of our businesses. The Steel Business System utilizes a strategy deployment process to execute strategic initiatives for each of our businesses to improve their performance, including objectives relating to manufacturing improvement, idea generation, product development, and global sourcing of materials and services.
Our operational initiatives include creating efficiencies through consolidated purchasing and materials sourcing provided by the Steel Partners Purchasing Council, which arranges shared purchasing programs and is reducing costs for, and providing other benefits to, a number of our companies. We strive to reduce our companies' operational costs, and enhance growth and profitability, through the implementation of Steel Partners Operational Excellence Programs, which include the deployment of Lean Manufacturing, Design for Six Sigma, Six Sigma and Strategy Deployment. We are focused on reducing corporate overhead 
4

of our companies by centralizing certain administrative and corporate services through Steel Services that provides management, consulting and advisory services.
Generally, we seek to actively acquire and maintain control over our companies through our ability to influence their policies. Depending on the size of our ownership interests in any given company, this may be achieved by obtaining board representation and overseeing and providing assistance to the existing management team. We generally view our companies as long-term holdings and we expect to realize value by operating them with a view towards fostering growth and maximizing their value rather than through the sale of ownership interests. The securities of some of the companies in which we have interests are traded on national securities exchanges, while others are privately held or not actively traded.
Customers
HNH is diversified across industrial markets and customers. HNH sells to customers in the construction, electrical, electronics, transportation, power control, utility, medical, oil and gas exploration, aerospace and defense, and food industries. No customer accounted for more than 10% of HNH's consolidated net sales in 2016, 2015 or 2014. HNH's 15 largest customers accounted for approximately 29% of consolidated HNH net sales in 2016.

API had two customers that made up 35% of its consolidated net revenue in 2016 and no customers accounted for more than 10% of API's consolidated net revenue in 2015. API's 15 largest customers accounted for approximately 62% of consolidated API net sales in 2016. 
The energy business primarily provides its services to customers' extraction and production operations in North Dakota and Montana in the Bakken basin, Colorado and Wyoming in the Niobrara basin, Texas in the Permian basin and New Mexico in the San Juan basin. Steel Excel relies primarily on its local operations to sell and market its services. In 2016, Steel Excel had two customers that made up 26% of its net revenue, and its top 15 customers made up 75%, 76% and 81% of its net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
WebBank earns interest income primarily from interest and fees earned on loans and investments and it earns non-interest income primarily from origination fees earned on loans, fee income on contractual lending arrangements, premiums on the sale of loans, and loan servicing fees. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the two highest grossing contractual lending programs accounted for 47%, 46% and 35%, respectively, of WebBank's total revenue. 
Raw Materials

Besides precious metals, the raw materials used in HNH's operations consist principally of stainless, galvanized silicon and carbon steel, aluminum, copper, tin, nickel alloys, a variety of high-performance alloys, permanent magnets, electronic and electrical components and various plastic compositions. The raw materials used in the operations of HNH's Performance Materials business consist principally of fiberglass, quartz and aramid yarns. HNH purchases all such raw materials at open market prices from domestic and foreign suppliers. HNH has not experienced any significant problem in obtaining the necessary quantities of raw materials. Prices and availability, particularly of raw materials purchased from foreign suppliers, are affected by world market conditions and government policies. The raw materials used by HNH in its non-precious metal products are generally readily available from more than one source. 
The raw materials used in the operations of API consist principally of board, PET film, organic solvents, aluminum, resins, pigments and adhesives. API purchases all such raw materials at open market prices and has not experienced any significant problem in obtaining the necessary quantities of raw materials. Prices and availability of raw materials purchased are affected by world market conditions and government policies. The raw materials used are generally readily available from more than one source.
HNH and API require significant amounts of electricity, oil and natural gas to operate their facilities and they are subject to price changes in these commodities. A shortage of electricity, oil or natural gas, or a government allocation of supplies resulting in a general reduction in supplies, could increase costs of production and could cause some curtailment of production.
Capital Investments
5

SPLP believes that in order to be and remain competitive, its businesses must continuously strive to increase revenue, improve productivity and product quality, and control and/or reduce manufacturing costs. Accordingly, SPLP expects to continue to make capital investments that reduce overall manufacturing costs, improve the quality of products produced and services provided and broaden the array of products offered to the industries SPLP serves, as well as replace equipment as necessary to maintain compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. SPLP's capital expenditures for 2016, 2015 and 2014 for continuing operations were $34,183, $23,252 and $28,769, respectively. SPLP anticipates funding its capital expenditures in 2017 from funds generated by operations and borrowed funds. 
Employment
As of December 31, 2016, HNH employed 3,470 employees worldwide. Of these employees, 410 were sales employees, 774 were office employees, 265 were covered by collective bargaining agreements, and 2,021 were non-union operating employees. As of December 31, 2016, API employed 616 employees worldwide. Of these employees, 74 were sales employees, 79 were office employees, 443 were manufacturing employees and 20 were in other functions. A total of 269 of API's employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
As of December 31, 2016, Steel Excel had 645 employees, of which 633 were full-time employees and 12 were part-time employees. All of Steel Excel's employees are located in the United States. Steel Excel also hires additional full-time and part-time employees during peak seasonal periods. None of Steel Excel's employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
As of December 31, 2016, WebBank had 62 employees.
As of December 31, 2016, Steel Services had 64 employees. 
Competition
There are many companies, larger and smaller, domestic and foreign, which manufacture products or provide services of the type offered by our subsidiaries. Some of these competitors are larger and have financial resources greater than our subsidiaries. Some of these competitors enjoy certain other competitive advantages, including greater name recognition, greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, a larger installed base of customers and well-established relationships with current and potential customers. 
Competition in the Diversified Industrial segment is based on quality, technology, service, reputation, price, and in some industries, new product introduction. 
Steel Excel's Energy business operates in a highly competitive industry that is influenced by price, capacity, reputation, and experience. In times of high demand, capacity, reputation and experience are major competitive forces. In times of low demand, service providers will compete on price to attract customers. In addition, Steel Excel needs to maintain a safe work environment and a well-trained work force to remain competitive. Steel Excel's energy services are affected by seasonal factors, such as inclement weather, fewer daylight hours and holidays during the winter months. Heavy snow, ice, wind, or rain can make it difficult to operate and to move equipment between work sites, which can reduce its ability to provide services and generate revenues. These seasonal factors affect Steel Excel's competitors as well. Because they have conducted business together over several years, the members of its local operations have established strong working relationships with certain of their clients. These strong client relationships provide a better understanding of region-specific issues and enable Steel Excel to better address customer needs. The market for the Steel Excel's Sports business' baseball facility services and soccer camps and leagues is very fragmented, and its competitors are primarily small local or regional operations. The market for its strength and conditioning services is fragmented, and its competitors vary from large national providers of such services to local providers of comparable or other niche services. 
WebBank competes with a broad range of banks, both larger and smaller, across its various lines of business.
Regulation

Certain of our business are subject to various regulations relating to protection of the environment, worker safety, the handling of hazardous materials, transportation standards, and banking. The Company does not presently anticipate that compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and controls will significantly change its competitive position, capital spending or earnings during 2017. SPLP believes its subsidiaries are in compliance with all orders and decrees it has consented to with environmental regulatory agencies. These regulations are discussed in more detail below. Also, please see "Item 1A - Risk Factors,"

"Item 3 - Legal Proceedings" and Note 18 - "Commitments and Contingencies" to the SPLP consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

â€¢ | The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, and comparable state laws ("CERCLA") impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain defined parties, including current and prior owners or operators of a site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and entities that disposed of or arranged for the disposition of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these parties may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that were released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Further, claims may be filed for personal injury and property damages allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances and other pollutants. We may encounter materials that are considered hazardous substances in the course of our operations. As a result, our businesses may incur CERCLA liability for cleanup costs and be subject to related third-party claims. We also may be subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, and comparable state statutes ("RCRA") related to solid wastes. Under CERCLA or RCRA, our subsidiaries could be required to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.


â€¢ | The Clean Water Act established the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and quality standards for surface waters. In addition, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 imposed a multitude of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in the waters of the United States. These and comparable state laws provide for administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and impose stringent requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as considerable potential liability for the costs of removal and damages in connection with unauthorized discharges.


â€¢ | The Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants and impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require our subsidiaries to obtain approvals or permits for construction, modification, or operation of certain projects or facilities and may require use of emission controls. Various scientific studies suggest that emissions of greenhouse gases, including, among others, carbon dioxide and methane, contribute to global warming. While it is not possible to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact the Company's businesses, any new restrictions on emissions that are imposed could result in increased compliance costs for, or additional operating restrictions on, the Company's customers, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's business.


â€¢ | The Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, and comparable state laws ("OSHA") regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA's hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in its operations be maintained and provided to employees and state and local government authorities. 

WebBank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the FDIC. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, WebBank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of WebBank's assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. WebBank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on WebBank's financial statements. In addition, federal banking laws and regulations generally would prohibit WebBank from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) if WebBank would be under-capitalized thereafter. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and must submit a capital restoration plan, which must be guaranteed by the institution's holding company. In addition, an undercapitalized institution is subject to increased monitoring and greater regulatory approval requirements. Currently, WebBank meets or exceeds all applicable regulatory capital requirements.        
WebBank is also subject to legal requirements in connection with the consumer and business lending programs that it originates. These include disclosure requirements, prohibitions on certain activities, and a broad prohibition on engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. These requirements are enforced by WebBank's regulators, the FDIC and the UDFI, as well as through private litigation.
