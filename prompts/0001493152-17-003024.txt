ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Name and Organization 
 
Park Place Energy Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, (“Park Place”, “Company”, “we” or “our”) is a U.S. based oil and gas exploration and production company. Our corporate headquarters are located at 2200 Ross Avenue, Suite 4500, Dallas, Texas 75201. The Company also has registered offices in Turkey and Bulgaria. Park Place was incorporated in Delaware in 2015.
General
 
Park Place Energy Inc. is focused on expanding its portfolio of projects in Southeast Europe, Turkey and countries in the immediate vicinity. The Company’s concentration is on recently acquired oil and gas producing assets in Turkey and a coal bed methane exploration license in Bulgaria.
Turkey
 
On January 18, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of three oil and gas exploration and production companies operating in Turkey (the “Tiway Companies”). The purchase price for the acquisition of the Tiway Companies from Tiway Oil B.V. was $2.1 million. As a result of the acquisition of the Tiway Companies, Park Place now owns interests in three producing oil and gas fields in Turkey, one of which is offshore and the other two are onshore. We have changed the name of the Tiway Companies to include Park Place in the name so hereinafter we will refer to them as the “PPE Turkey Companies”.
 
At December 31, 2016, net production to the PPE Turkey Companies from such fields was 280 barrels of oil equivalent per day or Boe/d; and for the year 2016, net production to the PPE Turkey Companies averaged 390Boe/d. In addition, at the time of completion of the acquisition, the PPE Turkey Companies had about US$745,000 in available cash. Due to the acquisition of the PPE Turkey Companies, the Company is now a qualified oil and gas operator in Turkey based in Ankara. With this base of operations in Turkey and its experienced management team, Park Place is poised to exploit these assets and for further growth in the region.
 
The primary asset of the PPE Turkey Companies is the offshore production license called the South Akcakoca Sub-Basin (“SASB”). Over $450 million has been invested in the SASB to date. The Company now owns a 36.75% working interest in SASB. SASB has four producing fields, each with a production platform plus subsea pipelines that connect the fields to an onshore gas plant. The four SASB fields are located off the north coast of Turkey towards the western end of the Black Sea in water depths ranging from 60 to110 meters. Gas is produced from Eocene age sandstone reservoirs at subsea depths ranging from 1100 to1800 meters.
 
The three nearer shore gas fields of Ayazli (discovered in 2004), Dogu Ayazli (discovered 2005) and Akkaya (discovered in 2006) were included in an initial phase of development with first gas production in 2007. The deeper water Akcakoca field (discovered in 2006) was developed later with first gas production in 2011. All the fields are developed using unmanned well head platforms/tripods tied back via an 18 kilometre (“km”) 12-inch pipeline to shared processing and compression facilities onshore at Cayagzi gas plant. The gas plant at Cayagzi is capable of processing up to 75 million cubic feet of gas per day. Sales gas is exported via an 18.6 km long 16-inch onshore pipeline, which ties into the main national gas transmission network operated by BOTAS. Historically, gas has been produced at rates of as high as 30 MMcf/d from SASB; total gross production to date from the four fields is in excess of 37 Bcf. The production license for SASB is covered by a modern 223 square kilometre 3D survey. There are five additional gas discoveries in SASB that have not yet been developed. Also, there are several additional prospects defined by 3D seismic data.
 
At December 31, 2016, the gross gas production rate for the seven producing wells in SASB was 2.56 MMcfd; the average daily 2016 gross production rate for the field was 4.36 MMcfd. At the end of February 2017, gas is currently sold at a price of approximately US$5.20 per Mcf for a netback per Mcf of approximately US$1.85. The plan for 2017 is to re-log certain of the wells; based upon those results, operations are planned to perforate the confirmed behind pipe reserves in order to increase production. In addition, we plan to install artificial lift on several of the wells. This plan is now underway with 3 wells having been logged in the first week of March 2017.

The Company has identified a number of proved undeveloped locations that can be drilled from the four existing production platforms. The Company envisions the next stage of development in 2018 will include the drilling of additional wells to materially increase the volumes of gas produced through the existing infrastructure.
 
With the acquisition of the PPE Turkey Companies, Park Place also acquired two other oil and gas assets: a 19.6% interest in the Cendere field, a producing oil field located in Central Turkey, and a 50% operated interest in the Bakuk gas field located near the Syrian border. At year-end 2016, the Cendere field was producing 123 barrels of oil per day, net to the PPE Turkey Companies; and averaged 118 barrels per day during 2016 net to the PPE Turkey Companies. The Bakuk field is shut-in with no plans to revive production in the near term.
 
Funds for the acquisition were raised through a combination of private placements and loans. From a private placement that closed in January 2017, along with an earlier placement that closed in early 2016, the Company raised just over $1.4 million. The remainder of needed funds was obtained through loans. The private placement that closed concurrent with closing of this acquisition raised $1,015,000. We sold units at $0.20 per unit which consisted of one common share and one share warrant at $0.40 exercisable on or before January 17, 2018.
 
Bulgaria License 
 
In October of 2010, the Company was awarded an exploration permit for the “Vranino 1-11 Block”, a 98,205 acre oil and gas exploration land located in Dobrudja Basin, Bulgaria, by the Bulgarian Counsel of Ministers. On April 1, 2014, the Company entered into an Agreement for Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prospecting and Exploration in the Vranino 1-11 Block with the Ministry of Economy and Energy of Bulgaria (the “License Agreement”). The initial term of the License Agreement is five years. This five-year period will commence once the Bulgarian regulatory authorities approve of the Company’s work programs for the permit area. The License Agreement (or applicable legislation) provides for possible extension periods for up to five additional years during the exploration phase, as well as the conversion of the License Agreement to an exploitation concession, which can last for up to 35 years. Under the License Agreement, the Company will submit a yearly work program that is subject to approval of the Bulgarian regulatory authorities.
 
The Company’s commitment is to perform geological and geophysical exploration activities in the first 3 years of the initial term (the “Exploration and Geophysical Work Stage”), followed by drilling activities in years 4 and 5 of the initial term (the “Data Evaluation and Drilling Stage”). The Company is required to drill 10,000 meters (approximately 32,800 feet) of new wellbore (which may be vertical, horizontal or diagonal) and conduct other exploration activities during the initial term.
 
Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Company is obligated to incur minimum costs during the initial term as follows:
 

(i) | $925,000 for the Exploration and Geophysical Work Stage; and 
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | $3,675,000 for the Data Evaluation and Drilling Stage. 

 
In addition, during the term of the License Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay an annual land rental fee of 15,897 BGN (US $8,584 based on the exchange rate of .54 Lev to Dollar as of March 7, 2017). The Company is permitted to commence limited production during the initial term of the License Agreement. Upon confirmation of a commercial discovery, the Company is entitled to convert the productive area of the license to an exploitation concession that may last for up to 35 years provided that the minimum work commitments are satisfied.
 
Before the license for the Bulgarian CBM project is “effective”, the Company’s overall work program and first year annual work program must be approved by both the Bulgarian environmental ministry and the energy ministry. On August 26, 2014, the Bulgarian environmental agency approved the Company’s overall work program and first year annual work program. A number of parties appealed the decision of the environmental agency and an appeal proceeding was commenced before a three judge administrative panel. The three judge panel issued a decision on February 3, 2017 in which it ruled that the environmental agency had failed to follow its own regulations in approving the Company’s work programs. Both the environmental agency and the Company have appealed the decision to a five-judge panel whose decision will be final. We anticipate this proceeding will take most of 2017 before a final decision is issued. The initial term of the License Agreement will not begin until (i) the appeals proceeding is completed and the decision upheld and (ii) the Bulgarian energy agency has approved the Company’s work programs.

Patents and Trademarks 
 
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark.
 
Research and Development Expenditures 
 
We have not incurred any research or development expenditures since our incorporation.
 
Government Regulation 
 
Our current or future operations, including exploration and development activities on our properties, require permits from various governmental authorities, and such operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which we are conducting business. These laws and regulations concern exploration, development, production, exports, taxes, labor laws and standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection and other matters. Compliance with these requirements may prove to be difficult and expensive. Due to our international operations, we are subject to the following issues and uncertainties that can affect our operations adversely:

● | the risk of expropriation, nationalization, war, revolution, political instability, border disputes, renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, and import, export and transportation regulations and tariffs; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | laws of foreign governments affecting our ability to fracture stimulate oil or natural gas wells, such as the legislation enacted in Bulgaria in January 2012, discussed in greater detail below; 
● | the risk of not being able to procure residency and work permits for our expatriate personnel; 
● | taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims; 
● | exchange controls, currency fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over international operations; 
● | laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment; 
● | the possibility of being subjected to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and 
● | the possibility of restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital from foreign countries. 

 
Permits and Licenses. In order to carry out exploration and development of oil and natural gas interests or to place these interests into commercial production, we may require certain licenses and permits from various governmental authorities. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain all necessary licenses and permits that may be required. In addition, such licenses and permits are subject to change and there can be no assurances that any application to renew any existing licenses or permits will be approved.
 
Repatriation of Earnings. Currently, there are no restrictions on the repatriation of earnings or capital to foreign entities from Bulgaria. In Turkey, funds which are invested in the Turkish entities and which are registered with the Turkish authorities may be repatriated without tax. There is a 10% tax on dividends on profits which are transferred out of Turkey. However, there can be no assurance that any such restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital from the aforementioned countries or any other country where we may invest will not be imposed, changed or increased in the future.
 
Environmental. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulations. Environmental regulations establish standards respecting health, safety and environmental matters and place restrictions and prohibitions on emissions of various substances produced concurrently with oil and natural gas. The regulatory requirements cover the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products and waste created by water and air pollution control procedures. These regulations may have an impact on the selection of drilling locations and facilities, potentially resulting in increased capital expenditures. In addition, environmental legislation may require those wells and production facilities to be abandoned and sites reclaimed to the satisfaction of local authorities. Such regulation has increased the cost of planning, designing, drilling, operating and, in some instances, abandoning wells. We are committed to complying with environmental and operation legislation wherever we operate.

There has been a recent surge in interest among the media, government regulators and private citizens concerning the possible negative environmental and geological effects of fracture stimulation. Some have alleged that fracture stimulation results in the contamination of aquifers and may even contribute to seismic activity. In January 2012, the government of Bulgaria enacted legislation that banned the fracture stimulation of oil and natural gas wells in Bulgaria and imposed large monetary penalties on companies that violate that ban. Such legislation or regulations could impact our ability to drill and complete wells, and could increase the cost of planning, designing, drilling, completing and operating wells. We are committed to complying with legislation and regulations involving fracture stimulation wherever we operate.
 
Such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own negligence, but may also expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. We may incur significant costs as a result of environmental accidents, such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures, or discharges of hazardous materials into the environment, including clean-up costs and fines or penalties. Additionally, we may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations and may be forced to pay fines or penalties if we do not comply.
 
Competition 
 
Both Turkey and Bulgaria import nearly all of their natural gas requirements. Both countries encourage domestic production as a way to reduce imports and increase energy security. In Turkey, natural gas is imported from a number of countries so there is a vibrant market for natural gas. In Bulgaria, currently one company, Gazprom, supplies Bulgaria with virtually all natural gas being marketed and consumed in Bulgaria through a pipeline that runs through Ukraine from Russia. On a regional level, we compete for license blocks and capital with other oil and gas exploration companies and independent producers who are actively seeking oil and natural gas properties throughout the world, but in particular, in Southeast Europe, Turkey and countries in the immediate vicinity.
 
The principal area of competition is encountered in the financial ability of our Company to acquire acreage positions and drill wells to explore for oil and natural gas, then, if warranted, install production equipment. Competition for the acquisition of oil and gas license areas is high in Europe. Therefore, we may or may not be successful in acquiring additional blocks in the face of this competition. Presently, we are not seeking additional license blocks.
 
From a general standpoint, we operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and acquisition with a substantial number of other companies, including U.S.-based and international companies doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. We face intense competition from independent, technology-driven companies as well as from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies in each of the following areas:
 

● | seeking oil and natural gas exploration licenses and production licenses and leases; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | acquiring desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration; 
● | marketing oil and natural gas production; 
● | integrating new technologies; and 
● | contracting for drilling services and equipment and securing the expertise necessary to develop and operate properties. 

 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, managerial, technological and other resources than we do. To the extent competitors are able to pay more for properties than we are paying, we will be at a competitive disadvantage. Further, many of our competitors enjoy technological advantages over us and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can. Our ability to explore for and produce oil and natural gas prospects and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations, implement advanced technologies, evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.
