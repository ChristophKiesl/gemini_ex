 OUR PRODUCTS

FREEDOM SYSTEM

We believe the FREEDOM System is the highest quality “system” available for both intravenous and subcutaneous drug delivery. The FREEDOM System comprises the FREEDOM60 or the FreedomEdge (a smaller version of the FREEDOM60), combined with HIgH-Flo Needle Sets and RMS Precision Flow Rate Tubing. The FREEDOM System is an easy-to-use, lightweight mechanical infusion system which uses a 60 ml syringe, is completely portable and maintenance free, with no batteries or electricity needed to operate. The FREEDOM System offers increased safety, greater reliability and an overall higher quality infusion than electrical pumps and other competitor products. For the infusion professional, the FREEDOM System delivers accurate infusion rates and class-leading flow performance. For the home infusion provider, the FREEDOM System is a cost-effective alternative to replace electronic systems.

The FREEDOM System operates with DynEq, which means the system operates at a safe, low pressure and maintains a balance between what a patient’s subcutaneous tissues are able to absorb and what the system delivers. This balance is created by a safe, limited and controlled pressure, which adjusts the flow rate automatically to the patient’s needs providing a reliable, faster and more comfortable administration with fewer side effects for those patients than with electronic devices. It is also environmentally friendly, since it does not require batteries or electricity to operate.

Ambulatory infusion systems are most prevalent in the outpatient and home care market, although RMS believes there is potential in the hospital setting as well.  Applications for the FREEDOM System have been expanded to a wide spectrum of clinical applications by the medical and nursing communities due to its unique constant flow design, fluid dynamics functionality and safety profile. The use of the FREEDOM System for treatment of primary immune deficiencies through subcutaneous immune globulin (“SCIg”) administration has continued to increase over the past several years and remains the leading system in the U.S. for these infusions.  For patients with Primary Immunodeficiency, Multifocal Motor Neuropathy, Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura and Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy, the FREEDOM System has vastly improved quality of life with much fewer unpleasant side effects than electronic devices. There is evidence that indications for SCIg therapy will continue to expand to other disease states. RMS believes the FREEDOM System is an ideal system for SCIg administration because:


• | the patient is able to self-administer in any location 
• | the pump is easily configured for this application 
• | it is the best value infusion system available in a heavily cost constrained market
• | it has demonstrated ultimate effectiveness and an impeccable safety profile 
• | the system prevents the negative side effects caused by other systems 


HIgH-Flo Needle Sets are a critical element of the FREEDOM System and feature unique design elements specific to subcutaneous self-administration, including a 5-bevel back-cut needle designed for more comfort and less tissue damage. This unique design prevents adverse side effects caused by conventional needles. In addition, the HIgH-Flo Needle Sets design permits drug flows which are the same or faster than those achieved with larger gauge needles, a critical success factor for very viscous Immunoglobulin G (“IgG”) drugs. RMS’s proprietary fluid dynamics engineering, compatible with the FREEDOM System supports the sensitivity of the system’s dynamic equilibrium, providing a better overall patient experience.

In March 2013, the Company expanded the range of product offerings of the HIgH-Flo Needle Sets to include 24 gauge sets which are used to deliver viscous fluids at higher flows rates while maintaining the safe lower pressure of the FREEDOM System. HIgH-Flo Needle Sets, due to their performance consistency and easy insertion, continue to be chosen by thousands of clinicians and are currently being used in clinical trials both domestically and internationally for a number of medications and therapies. 

RMS Precision Flow Rate Tubing is designed for repeatable flow rates, with no free-flow, bolus or overdose of medication.  The tubing controls the flow rate and infusion time for various applications when used with the FREEDOM System.  Each tubing set provides a different level of flow restriction and consistently delivers medication with low residual volume, resulting in less wasted drug. RMS tubing sets are uniquely calibrated to be part of the FREEDOM System.

In October 2016, RMS expanded its FREEDOM System offering to include the RMS Precision Flow Rate Controller (the “Controller”) after being granted a CE Mark, a mandatory conformity marking for products sold within the European Economic Area. It is now commercially available in Europe and Canada and is currently being used by patients throughout Germany and Sweden. The Controller is intended for use in the administration of three centipoise viscosity infusion fluids (e.g. HyQvia) to be delivered to

 the patient in a precise manner over a specified period of time. Used with the FREEDOM60 or the FreedomEdge, the Controller delivers safe and accurate flow control, while empowering the patient to administer self-treatment. The Controller is the only adjustable flow controller which allows the patient to titrate administration up or down while still delivering an accurate, repeatable and reliable flow. We are currently preparing our application for submission for FDA clearance.

In March 2016, the Company introduced its new On-Line Calculator, a tool to help providers determine which of the RMS Precision Flow Rate Tubing and HIgH-Flo Needle Sets to use based on the medication being administered and desired time of infusion. Customers responded well to the new calculator and expressed that the new format of the On-Line Calculator, which can be used on any computer, tablet or mobile device, was easy to use and very helpful. The calculator is based on well-known fluidic principles and provides consistent predictions of flow rates for various combinations of drugs, RMS Precision Flow Rate Controller, and High-Flo Needle Sets. 

RES-Q-VAC 

The RES-Q-VAC is a lightweight, portable, hand-operated suction device that removes fluids from a patient’s airway by attaching the RES-Q-VAC pump to various proprietary sterile and non-sterile single-use catheters sized for adult and pediatric suctioning without the need for electricity or batteries. The bottom-hinged, one-hand operation makes it extremely effective and the product is generally found in emergency vehicles, hospitals, disaster kits, mass casualty trailers and wherever portable aspiration is a necessity, including backup support for powered suction systems. Additional markets include nursing homes, hospice, sub-acute, dental and military applications. The Full Stop Protection® filter and disposable features of the RES-Q-VAC reduce the risk of exposing the health professional to human immunodeficiency virus or Tuberculosis when suctioning a patient or during post treatment cleanup. All of the parts that connect to the pump are disposable.

A critical component and significant advantage of the RES-Q-VAC system over similar products in the market, is its Full Stop Protection® filter, a patented filtering system that both prevents leakage and overflow of the aspirated fluids, even at full capacity, and traps many air- and fluid-borne pathogens and potentially infectious materials within the sealable container. This protects users from potential exposure to disease and contamination.
 
The Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) and World Health Organization continue to emphasize the importance of minimizing aerosol production during suctioning, in order to reduce the spread of pandemic and epidemic diseases such as Ebola and Influenza. At the current time, RMS believes that the RES-Q-VAC with Full Stop Protection is the only portable, hand-operated device to comply with CDC directives from 2003.

Hospitals are required under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act regulations to provide emergency treatment to patients anywhere in the primary facility and up to 250 yards away. The RES-Q-VAC enables full compliance with these regulations and helps minimize unfavorable outcomes and potential lawsuits. RMS provides special hospital kits, which are fully stocked to meet all hospital applications, both adult and pediatric.

SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

The FREEDOM System is sold through both direct sales and a network of medical device distributors, where the majority of our sales are generated. One distributor in the U.S. provides approximately 56.1% of our gross revenues. We believe many of our customers purchase FREEDOM System products through distributors for “one stop shopping” convenience, but that those customers would purchase directly from RMS should the distributor relationships dissolve. Internationally, the FREEDOM Systems are distributed mostly in Europe and Canada. RMS continues its efforts to expand to other countries around the world. 

RES-Q-VAC is sold globally by emergency medical device distributors in approximately 24 countries. These distributors generally sell to the end user and advertise these products in relevant publications and in their catalogs. We also sell directly to some physician offices, hospitals and other institutional customers. We market RES-Q-VAC through regional distributors specializing in the hospital respiratory care market. RMS is expanding distributorships in international markets where we believe RES-Q-VAC has higher potential. 

During the 2017 fiscal year, we expanded our efforts to market our FREEDOM System and RES-Q-VAC at national and international trade shows. We support shows attended by our primary customers such as MEDICA, Arab Health, National Home Infusion Association Conference, Infusion Nurses Society, European Society for Immunodeficiencies and the Immune Deficiency Foundation’s regional meetings.

 MANUFACTURING AND RAW MATERIALS 

The Company performs electromechanical assembly, calibration, pre- and post-assembly quality control inspection and testing, and final packaging for all products at its Chester, NY facility.

Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of components for our products. All of the components that go into the manufacturing of our products and accessories are sourced from third-party suppliers, and some of these components are provided by a single supplier, including two suppliers for molded plastic parts located in Taiwan, subassemblies from Command Medical Products, Inc. and tubing from Natvar, A Tekni-Plex Co., Inc. We believe we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of raw materials necessary to meet our needs. There always are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of raw materials, however, particularly where provided by a single supplier, which could impact availability in sufficient quantities to meet our needs.

In an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply, we work closely with suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. The Company also seeks to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy, and is working towards establishing several of these secondary sources. The cost and time required to fabricate molds to manufacture parts can slow the development of new products and might temporarily limit supply if we determine it is advisable to seek alternate sources of supply for existing products. 

The Company also utilizes long-term supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases. RMS is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market forces.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

We recognize the importance of innovation and renovation to our long-term success and are committed to research and new product development activities. Our product development team engages in consumer research, product development, current product improvement and testing activities, and also leverages our development capabilities by partnering with a network of outside resources. We spent $237,486 and $207,282 on research and development in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.

During fiscal 2017, we launched our new Controller and defined a product pipeline that enhances our current product offerings as well as broadens the range of products available. In addition to our internal resources, we plan to engage consultants to begin with moving our pipeline forward. 

QUALITY ASSURANCE

RMS’ success depends upon the quality of its products. Our quality management system plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, facilitating continuous improvement of the Company’s processes, products and services, and assuring the safety and efficacy of the Company’s products. 

Each product that we market is required to meet specific quality standards, both in packaging and in product integrity and quality. If either of those is determined to be compromised at any time, we take corrective and preventive actions designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to meet customer expectations.

On March 10, 2016, RMS initiated a Voluntary Medical Device Correction and Removal for its RMS Precision Flow Rate Tubing and HIgH-Flo Needle Sets, due to defective bags. On May 19, 2016, the entire process of field corrections and removal for the defective bags was completed and closed out without any complaint and/or adverse event reported from the field.

INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENT

Medicare currently provides reimbursement for the FREEDOM System, although there can be no assurance it will continue to do so. Medicare may allow reimbursement for other infusion pumps that are currently in the market or new ones that may enter shortly, which could adversely affect our sales into this market.

In order to receive more favorable Medicare reimbursement for the FREEDOM60, we submitted a formal request for a Healthcare Common Procedures Coding System (“HCPCS”) coding verification with the Statistical Analysis Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carrier. It was the determination that the Medicare HCPCS code(s) to bill the four Durable Medical Regional Carriers

 should be: “E0779 Ambulatory infusion pump, mechanical, reusable, for infusion 8 hours or greater.” This code provides reimbursement for the FREEDOM60 for billable syringe pump application approved by Medicare. Current approved uses under Medicare include among others, subcutaneous immune globulin, antivirals, antifungals, and chemotherapeutics.

The 21st Century Cures Act, which went into effect January 1, 2017, changes the payment structure for infusion drugs under the Part B Durable Medical Equipment (DME) benefit. Previously, the reimbursement rate covered service-intensive clinical therapies to administer drugs for heart failure and immunotherapy infusions. However, section 5004(a) of the Cures Act reduces the drug reimbursement structure, and there is no separate reimbursement for the services required to deliver these infusion services. While section 5012 includes a separate service payment, it doesn’t become effective until 2021. This means a gap of four years without home infusion coverage for many Medicare patients. Because the FREEDOM System is less costly than most competitive products, more Medicare patients may turn to the FREEDOM System during that gap.
COMPETITION AND THE MARKET 

FREEDOM SYSTEM

RMS is the global leader in mechanical infusion systems. Competition for Freedom Systems include; electrically powered pumps, elastomeric infusers and one competitor in mechanical devices. Electronic pumps are constant flow devices which deliver drugs at a programmed rate. These expensive devices can create high pressures during delivery which can cause complications for the patient. They require either batteries or another source of power and extensive training to properly program. Electronic pumps are used widely outside the U.S. and RMS devices are seen as an environmentally friendly, lower cost and easier to use alternative. Elastomeric infusers are a very low cost one-time-use balloon type devices used for infusion of drugs in intravenous (“IV”) applications. Pharmacies are required to fill them with drugs and deliver them to the patient. They are easy to use from the patient point of view since they are thrown away at the end of the infusion but they are more costly to fill, have issues with drug stability, retain up to 7% of the drug and end up in landfills (leaking drugs). Elastomeric devices are manufactured outside the U.S. by a number of competitors. RMS has one competitor in the mechanical device category. This competitor is a lower cost option in the market and has a stated strategy of under cutting RMS pricing. They manufacture in Mexico and sell primarily in the U.S., although they are attempting to expand to Europe. RMS successfully competes on quality, service and innovation with all competitors. 

The ambulatory infusion market of the FREEDOM System has been rapidly changing due to reimbursement issues. Insurance reimbursement has reduced the market share of high-end electronic type delivery systems. We believe market pressures have moved specialty pharmacies to consider alternatives to expensive electronic systems especially for new subcutaneous administrations, which usually cannot be done with gravity. For cost concerns, some patients have been trained to administer intravenous drugs through IV push where the drug is pushed into the vein directly from a syringe. Pharmacies are now seeing the financial benefit of using and reusing Freedom Systems rather than elastomeric devices for delivery of antibiotics. It is easier and less costly to fill syringes than elastomeric devices, the drugs are more stable and less is wasted. Even though price pressure continues to increase, the quality of Freedom Systems continues to win, since patient care is the top priority. Thus, we believe the overall trend continues to be towards syringe pumps such as the FREEDOM System and that quality will be the primary decision criteria. 

Internationally, the Company has engaged in clinical trials with a number of different drug companies in several countries. In January 2017, the umbrella organization of the public health insurance in Germany approved the FREEDOM System for reimbursement, and it was registered and listed in the Medical Device Registry in the category of mechanical infusion pumps. It is the only device of its kind registered within Germany. We continue our efforts to obtain registrations in other countries, which on average can take anywhere from twelve to eighteen months.

We are currently involved in legal proceedings with a competitor who has been offering accessories that can be used with the FREEDOM System (see Item 3 – Legal Proceedings).

RES-Q-VAC

We believe that the RES-Q-VAC is currently the performance leader for manual, portable suction instruments. In the emergency market, the primary competition is the V-VAC™ from Laerdal Medical. The V-VAC™ is more difficult to use, cannot suction infants, and cannot be used while wearing heavy gloves such as in chemical warfare or in the extreme cold. Another main competitor is the Ambu® Res-Cue Pump™, a lower-cost product similar to our design, made in China. We believe that the product is not as well made, as ergonomic, or as versatile, and may not be purchased by the military segment of the market due to lines of supply concerns. We believe that Full Stop Protection substantially separates the RES-Q-VAC from competitive units, which tend to leak fluid when becoming full or could pass airborne pathogens during use. There is a heightened concern from health care professionals concerning exposure to disease and we believe the RES-Q-VAC provides improved protection for these users.

 GOVERNMENT REGULATION

The FDA governs the development and manufacturing of all medical products. The FDA requires us to register our manufacturing facility, list our devices, file notice of intent to market new products, track the locations of certain products and to report any incidents of death or serious injury relating to the products with the FDA. We could become subject to civil and criminal penalties and/or recall, seizure or injunctions if we fail to comply with regulations of the FDA.

Periodically we are subject to inspections by the FDA District Office for quality system and good manufacturing practices compliance. RMS had an inspection by the FDA in June 2015, which included, among other items, a review of customer complaints, quality controls, quality assurance and documentation. The FDA inspection was then expanded as a consequence of an extensive “trade complaint” filed on behalf of a competitor which resulted in the issuance of an FDA FORM 483.   Eight months later without any further discussion with the FDA, on February 29, 2016 we received a Warning Letter.  The Company responded and replied numerous times to the Warning Letter from March 18, 2016 on, and underwent a follow up inspection on November 29, 2016. On December 16, 2016, the FDA issued another FDA FORM 483, to which the Company provided a written response on January 9, 2017 and provided a supplemental response on March 17, 2017 and April 24, 2017. On April 25, 2017, RMS met with the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”) Compliance team and the New York District Office to discuss the final resolution of Warning Letter closure. We continue to have correspondence and dialog with the agency in order to address all of FDA’s concerns cited in the Warning Letter and the FDA FORM 483s and to close the Warning Letter in the near future.

The Company is International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 13845:2012 certified. Our registrar is British Standards Institute (“BSI”).

The Company has received a positive letter from OSHA confirming that the RES-Q-VAC with Full Stop Protection falls under the engineering controls of the blood borne pathogen regulation and that the products use would fulfill the regulatory requirements. Full Stop Protection meets the requirement of OSHA as described in OSHA 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.1030 - Occupational Exposure to Blood borne Pathogens requires that employers of “... emergency medical technicians, paramedics, and other emergency medical service providers; fire fighters, law enforcement personnel, and correctional officers ... must consider and implement devices that are appropriate [to contain blood borne pathogens], commercially available and effective.” These first responders risk exposure to serious disease, and the employers may risk OSHA violations and lawsuits if they fail to consider protective measures such as our Full Stop Protection for RES-Q-VAC.

We are required to comply with federal, state, and local environmental laws; however, there is no significant effect of compliance on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We do not use significant amounts of hazardous materials in the assembly of our products.

EMPLOYEES

As of February 28, 2017, we had 69 full time employees and no part time employees.

The Company carries insurance on the life of Andrew Sealfon, President and Chief Executive Officer, providing a death benefit to the Company of $3.1 million. 

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We have filed and received U.S. protection for many of our products and, in some cases where it was no longer deemed economically beneficial, we have allowed certain patent protections to lapse. The patent position of small companies is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Consequently, there can be no assurance that patent applications relating to products or technology will result in patents being granted or that, if issued, the patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. There can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources necessary to enforce any patent rights we may hold. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for details regarding our patent litigation.
