Item 1. Business
Overview



We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (an “Initial Business Combination”). We intend to effectuate an Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering (the “Public Offering”) and the private placement that closed simultaneously with the Public Offering, including the proceeds from the Over-Allotment Public Units (as defined below) and the Over-Allotment Private Placement Units, and from additional issuances of, if any, our capital stock and our debt, or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 



In connection with our formation in June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary of B. Riley Financial was issued 7,187,500 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Founder Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. In June 2020, all of the Founder Shares were contributed to B. Riley Principal 250 Sponsor Co., LLC (the “Sponsor”), a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of B. Riley Financial.



The Company completed the sale of 15,000,000 units (the “Public Units”) at an offering price of $10.00 per Public Unit in the Public Offering on May 11, 2021. The Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 555,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (the “Private Placement Units”) in a private placement that closed on May 11, 2021 simultaneously with the Public Offering. The sale of the 15,000,000 Public Units in the Public Offering generated gross proceeds of $150,000,000, less underwriting commissions of $3,000,000 (2% of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering) and other offering costs of $571,103. The Private Placement Units generated $5,550,000 of gross proceeds. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of the prospectus for the Public Offering, May 7, 2021, to purchase additional Public Units. On June 14, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment in full and purchased an additional 2,250,000 Public Units (the “Over-Allotment Public Units”), generating gross proceeds of $22,500,000, less underwriting commissions of $450,000 (2% of the gross proceeds of the Over-Allotment Units). On June 14, 2021, simultaneously with consummation of the sale of the Over-Allotment Public Units, the Company consummated a private sale of an additional 45,000 Private Placement Units (the “Over-Allotment Private Placement Units”) to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $450,000.



Each Public Unit and Private Placement Unit consists of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value (“Class A common stock”, and with respect to the shares underlying the Public Units, the “Public Shares” and, with respect to the shares underlying the Private Placement Units, the “Private Placement Shares”), and one-third of one redeemable warrant (each a “Warrant” and, with respect to the Warrants underlying the Public Units, the “Public Warrants,” with respect to the Warrants underlying the Private Placement Units, the “Private Placement Warrants”). One Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one whole share of Class A common stock at an initial exercise price of $11.50 per share.



Upon completion of the Public Offering and the underwriters’ exercise of the over-allotment in full, $172,250,000 of proceeds were placed in the Company’s Trust Account at Bank of America, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”) and have been and will continue to be invested in permitted United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which we refer to as the Investment Company Act, having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Unless and until the Company completes the Initial Business Combination, it may pay its expenses only from the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside the Trust Account. As of December 31, 2022, there was $442,978 cash available to us outside the Trust Account.

Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, the proceeds from the Public Offering may not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of: (i) the completion of the Initial Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any Public Shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if it does not complete the Initial Business Combination by May 11, 2023; or (iii) the redemption of all of the Company’s Public Shares if the Company is unable to complete the Initial Business Combination by May 11, 2023 (at which such time up to $100,000 of interest shall be available to the Company to pay dissolution expenses), subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company’s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Company’s public stockholders.



Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption



All of the 17,250,000 Public Shares sold as part of the Public Units in the Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company’s liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Initial Business Combination. In accordance with SEC and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the entity’s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. Accordingly, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, since all of the shares of Class A common stock can be redeemed or become redeemable subject to the occurrence of future events considered outside the Company’s control under ASC 480-10-S99, all shares of Class A common stock subject to redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s balance sheets.



The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common stock are affected by charges against additional paid in capital and accumulated deficit.



Effecting Our Initial Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate an Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering, including the proceeds from the sale of the Over-Allotment Public Units, the Private Placement and the proceeds from the sale of the Over-Allotment Private Placement Units and from additional issuances of, if any, our capital stock and our debt, or a combination of cash, stock and debt as the consideration. We may be seeking to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.



If our Initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our Public Shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.



We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds other than the funds raised by the sale of the Public Units, the Over-Allotment Public Units, the Private Placement Units and the Over-Allotment Private Placement Units in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking due diligence and negotiating an Initial Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Initial Business Combination. We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of equity securities and may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination, and we may effectuate our Initial Business Combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. In addition, we are targeting businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units, and may as a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the Trust Account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemptions by public stockholders, be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed Initial Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Business Combination. In the case of an Initial Business Combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the Initial Business Combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities, or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our Initial Business Combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination



Nasdaq rules require that we must consummate an Initial Business Combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account). If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm that regularly prepares fairness opinions solely with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make such independent determination of fair market value, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value meets the 80% fair market value test, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our stockholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to stockholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed Initial Business Combination will include such opinion. In addition, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any Initial Business Combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.



We anticipate structuring our Initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our Initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Initial Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the Initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Initial Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our Initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% fair market value test. If the Initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. There is no basis for investors in the Public Offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our Initial Business Combination.



To the extent we effect our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us and other reviews as we deem appropriate. We may also retain consultants with expertise relating to a prospective target business.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with that process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our Initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Initial Business Combination.

Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. Solely for illustrative purposes, as of December 31, 2022, the amount in the Trust Account is approximately $10.07 per Public Share. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares, Private Placement Shares and any Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination. Such persons did not receive separate consideration for their waiver of redemption rights.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions; Submission of our Initial Business Combination to a Stockholder Vote



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Initial Business Combination or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, as described above under the heading “Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination.” Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure an Initial Business Combination with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed Initial Business Combination. So long as we maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq’s shareholder approval rules.



The requirement that we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares by one of the two methods listed above is contained in provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will apply whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on Nasdaq. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon.



If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:




● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our Initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the Initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Upon the public announcement of our Initial Business Combination, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Public Shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our Public Shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.



In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our Initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of Public Shares which are not purchased by our Sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If public stockholders tender more Public Shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the Initial Business Combination.



If we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in connection with a stockholder meeting, we will:




● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our Initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the Initial Business Combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our Sponsor will count toward this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their Founder Shares, Private Placement Shares and any Public Shares purchased (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our Initial Business Combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes, and abstentions will have no effect on the approval of our Initial Business Combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our Sponsor’s Founder Shares and Private Placement Shares, we would need only 6,168,751 or 35.8% of the 17,250,000 Public Shares sold in the Public Offering to be voted in favor of an Initial Business Combination (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our Initial Business Combination approved. If only the minimum quorum of shares of common stock is present at the meeting to approve our Initial Business Combination, we would need only 628,126 or 3.6% of the 17,250,000 Public Shares sold in the Public Offering to be voted in favor of an Initial Business Combination in order to have our Initial Business Combination approved. However, if certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation are proposed in connection with an Initial Business Combination, we may also require the approval of the holders of Public Shares voting as a separate class. We intend to give not less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our Initial Business Combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our Sponsor, officers and directors, may make it more likely that we will consummate our Initial Business Combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the Initial Business Combination, or do not vote at all, and irrespective of whether they hold Public Shares on the record date established for the stockholder meeting held to approve the Initial Business Combination.



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed Initial Business Combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Public Shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed Initial Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the Initial Business Combination or redeem any Public Shares, and all Public Shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our Initial Business Combination.



Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval



Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the Public Offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed Initial Business Combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem more than 20% of the shares sold in the Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with an Initial Business Combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we will not restrict our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our Initial Business Combination.

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have until May 11, 2023 to complete our Initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Initial Business Combination by such deadline, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination by May 11, 2023.
Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our Initial Business Combination, we have encountered and expect to continue encountering, intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the Initial Business Combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our Initial Business Combination and our outstanding Warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an Initial Business Combination.
Facilities



Our executive offices are located at 299 Park Avenue, 21st Floor, New York, NY 10171, and our telephone number is (212) 457-3300. Our executive offices are provided to us by an affiliate of our Sponsor. We have agreed to pay an affiliate of our Sponsor a total of $3,750 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees



We currently have one officer. This individual is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but he intends to devote as much of his time as he deems necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. The amount of time he will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the stage of the Initial Business Combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our Initial Business Combination.

Risk Factors Summary



An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk and uncertainties. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Such risks include, but are not limited to:

● | We are a blank check company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed Initial Business Combination, which means we may complete our Initial Business Combination even though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stockholders’ opportunity to effect their investment decision regarding a potential Initial Business Combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your Public Shares from us for cash.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, our Sponsor and management team have agreed to vote in favor of such Initial Business Combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability of our public stockholders to redeem their Public Shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into an Initial Business Combination with a target.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our Public Shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable Initial Business Combination or optimize our capital structure.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The requirement that we complete our Initial Business Combination within the prescribed timeframe may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating an Initial Business Combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Our search for an Initial Business Combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate an Initial Business Combination, may be materially adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and other events and the status of debt and equity markets, as well as protectionist legislation in our target markets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may elect to purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants from public stockholders, which may influence a vote on a proposed Initial Business Combination and reduce the public “float” of our Public Shares or Public Warrants.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our Public Shares in connection with our Initial Business Combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for submitting or tendering its Public Shares, such Public Shares may not be redeemed.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our stockholders are not entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our Initial Business Combination. If we have not completed our Initial Business Combination within the required time period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on our redemption of their Public Shares, and our Public Warrants will expire worthless.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units not being held in the Trust Account are insufficient to allow us to operate until at May 11, 2023, it could limit the amount of cash available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our Initial Business Combination, and we will depend on loans from our Sponsor or management team to fund our search and to complete our Initial Business Combination.
