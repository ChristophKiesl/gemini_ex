Background
 
CEN Biotech, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our” or “CEN” or the “Company”) is a Canadian holding company, incorporated in Canada on August 4, 2013 as a subsidiary of Creative Edge Nutrition, Inc. (“Creative”), a Nevada corporation. Creative separated its planned specialty pharmaceutical business located in Canada by transferring substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the planned specialty pharmaceutical business to CEN and effecting a distribution (the “Spin-Off Distribution”) of CEN common stock to Creative shareholders on February 29, 2016. The Spin-Off Distribution was intended to be tax free for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
Prior to the Spin Off Distribution, the Company initially pursued the cannabis business in Canada and obtained funding to build the initial phase of its comprehensive seed-to-sale facility and applied to obtain a license in Canada to begin operating its state-of-the-art medical marijuana cultivation, processing, and distribution facility in Lakeshore, Ontario. On March 11, 2015, the Company’s application for a license to produce marijuana for medical purposes was formally rejected by Canadian regulatory authority. On February 1, 2016 the Company commenced legal action against the Attorney General of Canada in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for damages for detrimental reliance, economic loss, and prejudgment and post judgment interest, costs of the proceeding and other relief that the court may seem just.  As of April 14, 2022 the action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice is still ongoing.  In the meantime the Company decided to develop and pursue other businesses that are related to Light Emitting Diode (“LED”) lighting and hemp-based industrial, medical and food products that have a tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) that is below 0.3%.
 
We are currently focused on the manufacturing, production and development of LED lighting technology and hemp-based products. The Company intends to continue to explore the usage of hemp, which it now intends to cultivate for usage in industrial, medical and food products. We also plan to expand our business to include Cannabis, Psychedelic Mushrooms, and Digital Communities. Our mission is to strive to be an agriculture based mindful provider of Phyto medical solutions developed to help improve "your" state of health and well-being.
 
On April 20, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Clear Com Media Inc., an Ontario, Canada corporation (“CCM”), each of the shareholders of CCM as set forth on the signature pages of the Agreement (the “CCM Shareholders”) and Lawrence Lehoux as the Representative of the CCM Shareholders (the “Shareholders’ Representative”, each of CCM and the CCM Shareholders may be referred to collectively herein as the “CCM Parties”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire from the CCM Shareholders, all of the common shares of CCM, which is 10,000 shares of CCM common shares (the “CCM Stock”) held by the CCM Shareholders in exchange (the “Exchange”) for the issuance by the Company to the CCM Shareholders of 4,000,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, no par value per share (the “Company Common Stock”). The Agreement closed on July 9, 2021 (the “Closing”). At Closing, the CCM Shareholders delivered the CCM Stock to the Company and the Company delivered the Company Common Stock to the CCM Shareholders, and CCM became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
Effective with the acquisition of CCM on July 9, 2021, the Company reports in two business segments, Growth and Digital. The Growth segment encompasses the activities of CEN Biotech, Inc. and focuses on the planned manufacturing, production and development of LED lighting technology and hemp-based products. The Digital segment encompasses the activities of CCM and focuses on providing digital marketing and web design related services. Substantially all of the Company’s operations are conducted within the United States of America and Canada.
 
Our principal office is located at 300-3295 Quality Way, Windsor, Ontario, Canada, N8T 3R9 and our phone number is (519) 419-4958. Our corporate website is located at http://www.cenbiotechinc.com. The information contained on or connected to our website is not part of this report and is not incorporated herein.
 
The Company derived approximately 99% of its revenue from one customer during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company had no revenue prior to July 9, 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we reported net losses of $18,903,656 and $6,929,398 (before gain on the one-time derecognition of certain debts and accrued interest of $21,179,043), respectively, and negative cash flow from operating activities of $320,395 and $340,749 respectively. As noted in our consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $45,964,183. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern; however, given our recurring losses from operations, management, as well as our auditors, have determined there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Overview

We are currently focused on the manufacturing, production and development of LED lighting technology and hemp-based products. The Company intends to continue to explore the usage of hemp, which it now intends to cultivate for usage in industrial, medical and food products. We also plan to expand our business to include Cannabis, Psychedelic Mushrooms, and Digital Communities. Our mission is to strive to be an agriculture based mindful provider of Phyto medical solutions developed to help improve "your" state of health and well-being.
 
Effective with the acquisition of CCM on July 9, 2021, the Company reports in two business segments, Growth and Digital. The Growth segment encompasses the activities of CEN Biotech, Inc. and focuses on the planned manufacturing, production and development of LED lighting technology and hemp-based products. The Digital segment encompasses the activities of CCM and focuses on providing digital marketing and web design related services. Substantially all of the Company’s operations are conducted within the United States of America and Canada.
 
On October 7, 2021, the Company finalized the acquisition of a patent related to LED Lighting, as further discussed below, and intends to explore development opportunities of the LED lighting technology across manufacturing operations and intends to explore licensing opportunities across industries such as the horticultural industry, including for the purpose of growing hemp, as well as the automotive, industrial and commercial lighting industries.         
 
The Company is in contract to acquire a 51% interest in Cen Ukraine LLC (“CEN Ukraine”) as described in detail below, which currently holds a license, granted by the federal government of Ukraine, for the cultivation and processing of cannabis sativa for industrial, supplement, pharmaceutical and other purposes in Ukraine. After closing this acquisition, the Company intends to explore the usage of hemp, which it intends to cultivate for usage in industrial, medical and food products.
 
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had advances of $1,299,328 and $1,179,328, respectively, to CEN Ukraine which is a related party. The advances were for the purpose of funding the operations of CEN Ukraine. These advances were substantially used as follows:
 

☐ | Approximately $420,000 to operate its office in Kiev;
--+------------------------------------------------------


☐ | Approximately $445,328 to employ several workers;
--+--------------------------------------------------


☐ | Approximately $350,000 for performing multiple test crops;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


☐ | Approximately $75,000 for oil processing activities; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


☐ | Approximately $9,000 for payment of rent.
--+------------------------------------------

 
There have been recent tensions between Ukraine and Russia, and in January of 2022, the U.S. President announced possible widescale sanctions against Russia in the event that Russia invades Ukraine. In February of 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and the U.S. President announced widescale sanctions against Russia. Due to such sanctions, as well as due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we could become unable to operate our planned business related to CEN Ukraine in the Ukraine as planned. Further, retaliatory acts by Russia in response to the sanctions could include cyber attacks, sanctions, or other actions that could disrupt the economy. Accordingly, our operating plans, business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely impacted by rising tensions, and the recent invasion in Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the Company determined that advances totaling $1,299,328 and note receivable of $44,859, as of such date, due to the Company from CEN Ukraine have been fully impaired as the current war in Ukraine continues to proceed. The Company has determined that it is unlikely that CEN Ukraine will have the ability to recover from the effects of the war in the foreseeable future.
 
Hemp is related to cannabis as both are classified under the same botanical category of Cannabis sativa L. A significant difference between the two is that cannabis has increased amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (5–20%), a psychotropic cannabinoid, and may have very little amounts of CBD (cannabidiol) and CBG (cannabigerol), which have no psychotropic properties (although regulations in certain countries, including Canada classify industrial hemp exclusively based on the THC content in the plant); whereas industrial hemp has virtually no THC (less than 0.3% w/w). The THC concentration in industrial hemp is not enough to provide psychotropic effects, which renders industrial hemp useless for recreational use or abuse, and therefore industrial hemp does not serve a recreational psychoactive purpose. Canada, China and the United Kingdom are examples of major industrialized countries that have permitted regulated production of industrial hemp, deriving economic benefits from its cultivation, distribution and sale.

Under favorable conditions, hemp is a plant easy to cultivate, with predictable harvests and produces overall negative carbon print compared to other agricultural sources used for production of biodiesels among other uses. Industrial hemp is rich in proteins and essential amino acids, which may render it as a favorable source of food and animal feed.
 
Products
 
LED Lighting 
 
On September 12, 2016, the Company executed an agreement to acquire a patent related to LED Lighting, from Tesla Digital, Inc., a Canadian Corporation and Stevan Pokrajac. As part of the transaction the Company will employ Stevan Pokrajac in connection with the start of operations by the Company after the acquisition and development of the acquired technology. As of April 14, 2022 the Company has not raised sufficient capital to start the development of the technology and begin operations. The patent intangible remained in escrow in the name of Tesla Digital, Inc., with CEN having the rights to use the patented technology, until full settlement of the terms of the agreement. On October 7, 2021, the acquisition was completed and the Company issued five million shares of common stock and the seller assumed certain debt owed by the Company.
 
The Company intends to explore using the LED Lighting across manufacturing operations and licensing opportunities across multiple industries such as the horticultural industry, including for the purpose of growing hemp as well as the automotive, industrial and commercial lighting industries.
 
Hemp 
 
On December 14, 2017, the Company entered into a Controlling Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Bill Chaaban, our Interim CEO, President and Chairman, and Usamakh Saadikh, a member of our board of directors (the “Sellers”) to acquire (the “Acquisition”) 51% of the outstanding equity interests in Cen Ukraine, a corporation that was organized and has its principal offices in Ukraine. The agreement, which is subject to certain conditions, has not closed as of April 14, 2022. Cen Ukraine was founded to seek agricultural and pharmaceutical opportunities in Ukraine. Cen Ukraine currently holds a license, granted by the federal government of Ukraine, for the cultivation and processing of cannabis sativa for industrial, supplement, pharmaceutical and other purposes in Ukraine. The consideration will be paid by issuing shares of common stock of the Company.
 
The Company intends, through Cen Ukraine, to explore the usage of hemp, which it intends to cultivate for usage in industrial, medical and food products.
 
The Company’s initial plans for the development of non-marijuana grade industrial hemp include targeting the automotive industry to supply hemp fiber, and investigating other industrial applications, and developing Hemp nutritional supplement and beverage products for the distribution through the extensive Ukrainian pharmacy network.
 
Industrial hemp has many uses, including paper, textiles, biodegradable plastics, construction, health food, and fuel. It also runs parallel with the "Green Future" objectives that are becoming increasingly popular. Hemp requires little to no pesticides or herbicides, controls erosion of the topsoil, and produces oxygen. Furthermore, hemp can be used to replace many potentially harmful products, such as tree paper (the processing of which uses chlorine bleach, which results in the waste product polychlorinated dibensodioxins, popularly known as dioxins, which are carcinogenic, and contribute to deforestation), cosmetics, and plastics, most of which are petroleum-based and do not decompose easily. The strongest chemical needed to whiten the already light hemp paper is non-toxic hydrogen peroxide.
 
Raw Materials and Components
 
We intend to grow and cultivate all of our hemp materials in the Ukraine through CEN Ukraine. Hemp is a plant easy to cultivate, with predictable harvests and produces overall negative carbon print compared to other agricultural sources used for production of biodiesels among other uses. CEN Ukraine obtains the required raw materials to grow Hemp, which include seeds from the Bast Institute, which is a part of the Ukrainian federal government. If the Bast Institute ceases to sell seeds to CEN Ukraine, it would have to find an alternate supplier, and there can be no assurance that it would be able to do so.
 
We intend to utilize strategic partners, contract manufacturers, and/or other third-party suppliers for the production of our LED Lighting Products. The raw materials and supplies required for the production of our lighting products may be available, in some instances from one supplier, and in other instances, from multiple suppliers. In those cases where raw materials are only available through one supplier, such supplier may be either a sole source (the only recognized supply source available to us) or a single source (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We, our strategic partners, contract manufacturers, and/or other third-party suppliers will adopt appropriate policies to attempt, to the extent feasible, to minimize our raw material supply risks, including maintenance of greater levels of raw materials inventory and implementation of multiple raw materials sourcing strategies, especially for critical raw materials. Although to date we have not experienced any significant delays in obtaining any raw materials from suppliers, we cannot provide assurance that we, our strategic partners, contract manufacturers, and/or other third-party suppliers will not face shortages from one or more of them in the future.

Research and Development
 
The Company contracts with Stevan Pokrajac, the developer of the patented LED Lighting Technology, to assist the Company with the development of the acquired technology. As part of the acquisition Mr. Pokrajac will become an employee of the LED subsidiary with compensation of $200,000 per year commencing with the start of operations by the Company after the acquisition and development of the acquired technology. As of April 14, 2022 the Company has not raised sufficient capital to start the development of the technology and begin operations.
 
We intend to grow and cultivate all of our hemp materials in the Ukraine through CEN Ukraine. CEN Ukraine has conducted research over the past four years relating to planting and harvesting hemp, as well as the processing of hemp into final products utilizing contract manufacturers. CEN Ukraine also has a full time agronomist, which is an expert in the science of soil management and crop production, on its staff. 
 
Competition
 
We expect that our LED Lighting Products will compete against a variety of lighting products, including conventional light sources such as compact fluorescent lamps and High Intensity Discharge (“HID”) lamps, as well as other LED lighting products. Our ability to compete depends substantially upon the superior performance and lower total cost of ownership of our products. We anticipate that the competition for our products will also come from new technologies that offer increased energy efficiency, lower maintenance costs, and/or advanced features. We expect to compete with LED systems produced by large lighting companies, as well as smaller manufacturers or distributors. Some of these competitors offer products with performance characteristics similar to those of our products.
 
Hemp-based products and the number of companies that produce them have experienced rapid growth in recent years, stemming in part from recent trends toward legalization of hemp in industrialized countries. Consequently, we will be operating in a highly competitive marketplace with various competitors. Increased competition may result in lower than anticipated gross margins and/or loss of market share, either of which would seriously harm its business and results of operations. Management cannot be certain that we will be able to compete against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not seriously harm our business. Some of our potential competitors are much larger and have greater access to capital, sales, marketing and other resources. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new regulations or devote greater resources to the development and promotion of their business model than we can. Furthermore, some of these competitors may make acquisitions or establish co-operative relationships among themselves or with third parties in the industry to increase their ability to rapidly gain market share.
 
The competitive factors facing us include safety, efficacy, price, quality, breadth of product line, manufacturing quality and capacity, service, marketing and distribution capabilities. Our current and future competitors may have greater resources, more widely accepted and innovative products and stronger name recognition than we do. Our ability to compete is affected by our ability, or that of our strategic partners, to:
 

● | develop or acquire new products and innovative technologies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | obtain licenses, permits and regulatory clearance and compliance, when necessary, for our products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | manufacture and sell our products cost-effectively;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | meet all relevant quality production, manufacturing and standards for our products in their particular markets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | respond to competitive pressures specific to each of our geographic and product markets;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    8 

  


● | protect the proprietary technology of our products and avoid infringement of the proprietary rights of others;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | market our products;
--+---------------------


● | attract and retain skilled employees, including sales representatives;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintain and establish distribution relationships; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | engage in acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Competitors could develop products that are more effective, cost less or are ready for commercial introduction before our products. If our competitors are better able to develop and patent products earlier than we can, or develop more effective and/or less expensive products that render our products obsolete or non-competitive, our business will be harmed and our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.
 
Customers
 
We currently do not have any customers for our LED Lighting Products and we have not yet developed any hemp-based products. The Company derived approximately 99% of its revenue from one customer, Post Media, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Nearly all of the accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021 are due from this customer. The loss of this customer could adversely affect short-term operating results. The customer is primarily receiving Web related services including; managed chat, search engine optimization, landing page design and social media marketing.
Intellectual Property 
 
On September 12, 2016, the Company executed an agreement to acquire assets, including patented LED Lighting, from Tesla Digital, Inc. (a Canadian corporation) and Stevan (Steve) Pokrajac. The patent intangible remained in escrow in the name of Tesla Digital, Inc., with CEN having the rights to use the patented technology, until full settlement of the terms of the agreement. On October 7, 2021, the acquisition was completed and the Company issued five million shares of common stock and the seller assumed certain debt owed by the Company.
 
The patent referenced above was issued on May 13, 2014 under Patent No. US 8,723,425 by the United States Patent Office, and has a duration until June 17, 2031.
 

U.S. Patent Application No. | Application Filing Date | Status | U.S. Patent No. | Issue Date | Subject Matter 
----------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+-----------------+------------+------------------------------------
13/525,703 | 06/18/2012 | Issued U.S. Patent | 8,723,425 | 05/13/2014 | Light Emitting Diode Driver Circuit

 
The Company plans to explore manufacturing operations and licensing opportunities across multiple industries such as horticultural, automotive, industrial and commercial lighting. The assets acquired other than the patent included old machinery and raw materials. The Company has assigned no value to these since their value was not relevant to or calculated in the Company’s offer for acquisition.
 
Employees 
 
We have four full time employees and no part time employees. We engage consultants to provide us with the services we need to plan and develop our facilities and products.

Recent Developments
 
The continued outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which the World Health Organization declared in March 2020 to be a pandemic, continues to spread throughout the United States of America and the globe, including through additional variants. Many State Governors have issued temporary Executive Orders that, among other stipulations, effectively prohibit in-person work activities for most industries and businesses, having the effect of suspending or severely curtailing operations. Certain state governments are now beginning to ease up on the restrictions implemented, however such restrictions remain in flux and we have no way of predicting if, and when, they’ll be lifted. The extent of the ultimate impact of the pandemic on the Company's operational and financial performance will depend on various developments, including the duration and continued spread of the outbreak, and its impact on potential customers, employees, and vendors, all of which cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. While management reasonably expects the COVID-19 outbreak to negatively impact the Company's financial condition, operating results, and timing and amounts of cash flows, the related financial consequences and duration are highly uncertain.

On December 6, 2021, Joseph Byrne resigned from his position as a President of the Company, effective on that date. Mr. Byrne served as a President of the Company from April 19, 2021 to December 6, 2021, and remains a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, and has served in such capacity since April 19, 2021.

On December 6, 2021, the Board approved the change in position of Bill Chaaban from a co-President of the Company to the sole President of the Company. Mr. Chaaban is currently the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, as well as Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors.
 
There have been recent tensions between Ukraine and Russia, and in January of 2022, the U.S. President announced possible widescale sanctions against Russia in the event that Russia invades Ukraine. In February of 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and the U.S. President announced widescale sanctions against Russia. Due to such sanctions, as well as due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we could become unable to operate our planned business related to CEN Ukraine in the Ukraine as planned. Further, retaliatory acts by Russia in response to the sanctions could include cyber attacks, sanctions, or other actions that could disrupt the economy. Accordingly, our operating plans, business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely impacted by rising tensions, and the recent invasion in Ukraine.
 
From January 1, 2022 to April 14, 2022, the Company authorized and issued 416,667 shares of its common stock upon conversion of the principal amount due under a note to a person. The principal amount of the note prior to conversion was $100,000.
 
Near Term Operating Plan
 
Plan of Operations of CEN Biotech Inc.
 
Our monthly “burn rate,” the amount of expenses we expect to incur on a monthly basis, is approximately $100,000 for a total of $1,200,000 for the maximum of 12 months. We have relied and will continue to rely on capital raised from third parties to fund our operating expenses during the following 12 months.
 
In order to complete our plan of operations, we estimate that $6,100,000 in funds will be required. The source of such funds is anticipated to be from capital raised from third parties. If we fail to generate $6,100,000 of funds from capital raised, we may not be able to fully carry out our plan of operations.
 
Generally, the funds are planned to be invested as follows: $2.2 million in LED lighting manufacturing, $200,000 to obtain quotation on OTCQB, $2.5 million to complete acquisitions in the phyto medical space including cannabis and psychedelic mushrooms and $1.2 million in general operating costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the foregoing funds or proceed as planned.
 
We hope to reach the following milestones in the next 12 months:
 

☐ | August 2022 – The Company intends to close a minimum of two acquisitions in the phyto medical space and we estimate the cost of this to be $1,250,000.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | November 2022 - The Company intends to close an additional two acquisitions in the phyto medical space and we estimate the cost of this to be $1,250,000.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    13 

  


● | April 2022 to December 2024 – The Company intends to explore using the LED lighting patent across manufacturing operations and licensing opportunities across multiple industries such as the horticultural industry, as well as the automotive, industrial and commercial lighting industries as follows:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | Lease production facility expected to take place in April, 2023 and we estimate the costs of this to be $400,000 annually.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | Lease equipment expected to take place in June, 2023 and we estimate the costs of this to be $400,000 annually.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | Hire staff expected to take place in May, 2023 and we estimate the costs of this to be $600,000 annually.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | Initial raw materials expected to take place in May, 2023 and we estimate the costs of this to be $500,000 one time.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | Marketing and delivery expected to take place in September, 2023 and we estimate the costs of this to be $300,000 annually.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Achievement of the milestones will depend highly on our funds and the availability of those funds. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete such milestones.
 
Plan of Operations of Clear Com Media, Inc.
 
The current burn rate for CCM inclusive of all wages and operating costs is approximately $120,000 CDN per month or $1,440,000 CDN per year (Approx. $1,152,000 USD). We anticipate a decrease of 30% in this burn rate with the elimination of some staff members that provide the SEO and custom development services that are no longer being performed by CCM. We will potentially rehire some of these people in order to retool the focus of the business and pivot to the development of some products as soon as it is financially viable to do so.
 
The following highlights the major goals and activities planned for the next twelve months:
 

● | Expansion of CCM’s enterprise hosting infrastructure for CCM’s client services and CCM products to address the ongoing growth needs of the business.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The pace of development of the Chatter product has been modified to meet the changing needs of the business and to address new market realities. Progress continues but a refocus on core deliverables that delivers a new phased approach to product roll out is being implemented. Recent changes in sales, the competitive landscape and modified revenue forecasts have triggered a pivot in terms of priorities and timing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The development of the Block Chain Permission Platform has been modified to solely focus on the R&D elements of the offering. Commercialization of the product has been reorganized to be addressed later once we have achieved new internal goals and milestones; however, work continues on the core offering with clear goals and objectives in mind.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continued development of internal efficiency processes and automated systems for tasks such as workflow, billing, subscriptions, security and internal cloud computing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The marketing of both the Chatter and Block Chain product and service are being refined based on new and ongoing information that is being gathers from our target markets and the rapidly changing landscape of the verticals we operate in. As our research continues, we hope to commence marketing efforts in second to third quarter of next year when the products are in a completed and in a commercially viable state.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The development of digital community project remains at the discovery stage and research continues about the participants and nuances of this space and how we feel we can best serve this vertical. Once a plan is formalized new hires will be recruited to address the specific development needs of this product and service.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continued support and a modest expansion of the core services offered by to our key business partners and direct customers. These services include but are not limited to responsive website design, online chat, social media marketing and landing page development.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As part of our renegotiation with Postmedia as are no longer providing the SEO and custom development services going forward.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No acquisitions are being considered at this time until the proper financing is in place to do so.

Government Regulations
 
Hemp and Cannabis
 
As discussed above, we plan on expanding our business plan to include (i) the cultivation and production of hemp in the Ukraine (ii) the manufacturing of hemp products in the Ukraine and Canada and (iii) the sales and distribution of hemp products globally, including but not limited to Canada, Ukraine, and the United States. We also plan to expand our business to include cannabis, as we are currently seeking to engage in potential mergers and acquisitions related to Cannabis in Canada, which will subject us to additional government regulations.
Cannabis versus Hemp
 
While hemp and cannabis are both derived from the same species (Cannabis sativa), there are major differences in the characteristics of the respective plant strains that produce industrial hemp on the one hand, and cannabis products on the other. In short, hemp is a strain of the Cannabis sativa plant that has been grown primarily for use in industrial applications and has been specifically cultivated to produce a low tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) content and a high cannabidiol (“CBD”) content. THC is the psychoactive constituent of cannabis and is responsible for producing the psychoactive effects of the drug. CBD is another active ingredient present in Cannabis sativa plants, and it largely acts to neutralize the psychoactive effects of THC and is not associated with psychoactive effects. Since hemp strains have very little THC and a lot of CBD, they do not produce psychoactive effects when ingested.  
Canada
 
In Canada, cannabis and industrial hemp are governed by separate regulations under the Cannabis Act. The products are legally distinguished by the concentration of THC in the leaves and flowering heads of the plant. A cannabis plant containing more than 0.3% THC w/w is legally defined as cannabis. A cannabis plant containing less than 0.3% THC w/w is legally defined as industrial hemp. Although we will not pursue any business related to cannabis (whether for recreational and medicinal purposes), we do intend to manufacture and offer hemp-based products in Canada upon obtaining required licensing under the Industrial Hemp Regulations.
 
Licensing, production, processing, distribution, marketing, importation, exportation and sale of cannabis and cannabis derivative products are regulated by the Cannabis Regulations, promulgated under the Cannabis Act. Cannabis is legal in Canada for both recreational and medicinal purposes. Initially, medicinal use of cannabis was legalized in Canada on July 30, 2001 under conditions outlined in the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations, later superseded by the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations, governed by Health Canada. The federal Cannabis Act, and associated Cannabis Regulations came into effect on October 17, 2018 and made Canada the second country in the world to formally legalize the cultivation, possession, acquisition, distribution, sale and consumption of recreational cannabis and its derivatives. In October 2019, additional regulations came into force, permitting the production, distribution, sale and consumption of a broader range of cannabis products, including edible cannabis, cannabis topicals and extract cannabis products.
 
Activities involving the licensing, cultivation, production, importation, exportation and sale of industrial hemp and derivatives of industrial hemp plants are regulated by the Industrial Hemp Regulations, also promulgated under the Cannabis Act. As indicated above, industrial hemp is defined as any part of the cannabis plant that contains 0.3% or less of THC w/w. There is no limit on how much CBD may be contained in industrial hemp plants or derivative products. A product made by processing the grain of industrial hemp or a product made from that processed grain is exempt from application of the Industrial Hemp Regulations where the concentration of THC in the product is 10 “g/g THC or less. Additionally, non-viable cannabis seeds, bare mature stalks and fiber derived from these stalks are exempt from application of the Cannabis Act and Industrial Hemp Regulations.
 
An industrial hemp license holder is authorized to conduct any of the following activities that are authorized by its license:
 
(a) to sell industrial hemp, with certain restrictions. In particular, flowering heads, leaves and branches may only be sold to a holder of an industrial hemp license or license governed by the Cannabis Regulations;
 
(b) to import or export seed or grain, with certain additional requirements (as set out below);
 
    15 

  

(c) to cultivate industrial hemp. However, other than a plant breeder, a license holder may only sow seed of pedigreed status that is of an approved cultivar or from a varietal that is set out in its license;
 
(d) in the case of a plant breeder, to propagate industrial hemp from a varietal that is set out in its license;
 
(e) to possess seed or grain for the purposes of cleaning it;
 
(f) to possess grain for the purpose of processing it. However, the holder of a license that authorizes possession of grain for the purposes of processing it, must render the grain non-viable and conduct adequate testing to ensure same; or
 
(g) to obtain seed by preparing it.
 
A license holder, whose license authorizes importation and exportation must also acquire the necessary permits to import and export. There are additional restrictions on importing, as follows:
 

● | an importer of seed must only import seed of pedigreed status that is of an approved cultivar; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | a plant breeder must only import seed of a variety of industrial hemp that is set out in its license; and 
● | an importer of grain must only import grain from a country that participates in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Seed Schemes or a country that has an agency that is a member of the Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies.

 
It is important to note that not every activity involving industrial hemp falls within the scope of the Industrial Hemp Regulations. For example, extraction of CBD from the flowering heads, leaves and branches of an industrial hemp plant would require a cannabis processing license and would be regulated under the Cannabis Regulations.
 
United States
 
Until 2014, when 7 U.S. Code §5940 became federal law as part of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (the “2014 Farm Act”), products containing oils derived from hemp, notwithstanding a minimal or non-existing THC content, were classified as Schedule I illegal drugs. The 2014 Farm Act expired on September 30, 2018, and was thereafter replaced by the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 on December 20, 2018 (the “2018 Farm Act ”), which amended various sections of the U.S. Code, thereby removing hemp, defined as cannabis with less than 0.3% of THC, from Schedule 1 status under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), and legalizing the cultivation and sale of hemp at the federal level, subject to compliance with certain federal requirements and state law, amongst other things. THC is the psychoactive component of plants in the cannabis family generally identified as marihuana or marijuana. We anticipate that our hemp products will be federally legal in the United States in that they will contain less than 0.3% of THC in compliance with the 2018 Farm Bill guidelines and will have no psychoactive effects on our customers bodies. Notwithstanding, there is no assurance that the 2018 Farm Act will not be repealed or amended such that our products containing hemp-derived CBD would once again be deemed illegal under federal law.
 
The 2018 Farm Bill also shifted regulatory authority from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Department of Agriculture. The 2018 Farm Bill did not change the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) oversight authority over hemp products. The 2018 Farm Act delegated the authority to the states to regulate and limit the production of hemp and hemp derived products within their territories. Although many states have adopted laws and regulations that allow for the production and sale of hemp and hemp derived products under certain circumstances, no assurance can be given that such state laws may not be repealed or amended such that our intended hemp products would once again be deemed illegal under the laws of one or more states now permitting such products, which in turn would render such intended products illegal in those states under federal law even if the federal law is unchanged. In the event of either repeal of federal or of state laws and regulations, or of amendments thereto that are adverse to our intended hemp products, we may be restricted or limited with respect to those products that we may sell or distribute, which could adversely impact our intended business plan with respect to such intended products. 
 
Additionally, the FDA has indicated its view that certain types of hemp products may not be permissible under the United States Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). The FDA’s position is related to its approval of Epidiolex, a marijuana-derived prescription medicine to be available in the United States. The active ingredient in Epidiolex is CBD. On December 20, 2018, after the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb issued a statement in which he reiterated the FDA’s position that, among other things, the FDA requires a cannabis product (hemp-derived or otherwise) that is marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit, or with any other disease claim, to be approved by the FDA for its intended use before it may be introduced into interstate commerce and that the FDCA prohibits introducing into interstate commerce food products containing added hemp, and marketing products containing hemp as a dietary supplement, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. Although we believe our planned hemp product offerings comply with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, legal proceedings alleging violations of such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
    16 

  

We do not intend to offer and do not compete with companies that offer cannabis products containing high levels of psychoactive THC in the United States. Although legal in some states in the United States, we do not intend to enter into this market. We may offer hemp-based products to customers in the United States but will not compete with any medical or recreational marijuana sellers of products for high THC content sales due to legal and regulatory restrictions and uncertainty in the United States. Because of regulatory challenges facing marijuana companies in the United States, the vast majority of the companies focused on THC are Canadian and foreign, although several have begun to pursue domestic activities in states that permit marijuana sales. Federal law does not generally recognize marijuana (or hemp that exceeds 0.3% THC) as lawful, although that may change in the future.
 
Ukraine
 
Hemp is a traditional crop cultivated in Ukraine for centuries. Industrial hemp production is allowed in Ukraine for seeds and fibers only. Growers must apply for a license in advance of the growing season and must be in compliance with the applicable licensing conditions. There are no known limitations on the circulation of hemp seeds, fibers and products of processing thereof, that have a THC limit below the regulatory requirements of the Ukraine (which are 0.08 percent). Hemp plantations that demonstrate THC level above 0.08 percent must be destroyed by a farmer. A farmer needs a license to grow hemp. The license is issued by the State Service of Ukraine on Medicines and Drugs Control (SSUMDC). A grower should submit an application to the SSUMDC before the growing season begins (usually in the autumn). After the growing season is completed (but before October 1), farmers must submit their annual reports on the volume of hemp production to SSUMDC. These regulations are uniformly applicable to the whole country. If we close on the CEN Ukraine Acquisition as planned, CEN Ukraine, which we plan to use to grow and cultivate hemp for all of our hemp related products will have to comply with all of the applicable laws and regulations applicable to hemp in the Ukraine. Currently, CEN Ukraine holds a license, granted by the SSUMDC, for the cultivation and processing of cannabis sativa for industrial, supplement, pharmaceutical and other purposes in Ukraine.
Worldwide
 
We initially plan to sell and distribute our hemp products in the U.S. and Canada, however, we may in the future, possibly seek to sell and distribute our hemp products in geographic areas that permit the sale and distribution of same. Since hemp is derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, there will be laws, rules and regulations that the Company will have to comply with in certain areas in order to conduct sales and distributions of its hemp products in such areas. Every country, state and region may have their own specific laws, rules and regulations applicable to the sale and distribution of hemp and the Company will have to comply with all such applicable laws, rules and regulations when conducting its hemp sales and distribution activities in the applicable areas. Further, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to hemp worldwide may change and the Company will have to adapt to same, or if there is a ban of the sale and distribution of hemp products in certain areas, the Company will not be able to conduct sales and distributions of its hemp products in such areas.
Psychedelic Mushrooms
 
Our plan to expand our business to include psychedelic mushrooms, as we are currently seeking to engage in potential mergers and acquisitions related to psychedelic mushrooms in Canada, will subject the Company to state and federal regulation.
Canada
 
In Canada, oversight of healthcare is divided between the federal and provincial governments. The federal government is responsible for regulating, among other things, the approval, import, sale, and marketing of drugs such as psilocybin and other psychedelic substances, whether natural or novel. The provincial/territorial level of government has authority over the delivery of health care services, including regulating health facilities, administering health insurance plans such as the Ontario Health Insurance Plan, distributing prescription drugs within the province, and regulating health professionals such as doctors, psychologists, psychotherapists and nurse practitioners. Regulation is generally overseen by various colleges formed for that purpose, such as the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario. Certain psychoactive compounds, such as psilocybin, are considered controlled substances under Schedule III of the CDSA.
 
    17 

  

United States
 
Psilocybin is strictly controlled under the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. §801, et. seq. (“CSA”). Psilocybin is a Schedule 1 drug under the CSA, which means that it currently has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and a high potential for abuse. 
Worldwide
 
We may in the future, possibly seek to expand our planned operations relating to psychedelic mushrooms in geographic areas that permit such operations. There will be laws, rules and regulations that the Company will have to comply with in certain areas in order to conduct such operations in such areas. Every country, state and region may have their own specific laws, rules and regulations applicable to psychedelic mushrooms and the Company will have to comply with all such applicable laws, rules and regulations when conducting such activities in the applicable areas. Further, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to psychedelic mushrooms worldwide may change and the Company will have to adapt to same.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
 
As a public reporting company with less than $1,070,000,000 in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. In particular, as an emerging growth company we:

● | are not required to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act. Our election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under §107 of the JOBS Act.
 
Certain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation and report regarding management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to provide a pay-for-performance graph or Chief Executive Officer pay ratio disclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.
 
Under the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. The registration statement was declared effective on June 30, 2020. The first day of trading was April 5, 2021. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be an “emerging growth company” if we have more than $1,070,000,000 in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We would cease to be an emerging growth company on the last day of the fiscal year following the date of the fifth anniversary of our first sale of common equity securities under an effective registration statement or a fiscal year in which we have $1 billion in gross revenues. Further, under current SEC rules we will continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” for so long as we have a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $250 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.

Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we may become party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party, as plaintiff or defendant, to any legal proceedings that we believe to be material or which, individually or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation if determined adversely to us. We are currently in the discovery phase in our lawsuit against Health Canada. We have requested to depose a senior level Health Canada employee who spearheaded the medical marijuana program.
Properties
 
CCM currently leases office space in Windsor, Ontario from JJ Capital Properties, Inc. under a noncancelable operating lease agreement that expires in June 2024. Monthly lease payments range from CAD 5,072 to CAD 5,595. In addition, the lease calls for variable charges for common area usage which are expensed as incurred.
 
CEN leased office space in Windsor, Ontario from RN Holdings Ltd. The lease commenced on October 1, 2017 with R&D Labs (whose President is Bill Chaaban) and was subsequently assigned by R&D Labs to RN Holdings Ltd (a third-party) on May 8, 2019. The lease calls for monthly rental payments ranging from $2,608 to $3,390 through September 2027. Effective August 1, 2020, the Company ceased making payments and abandoned the leased space. Accordingly, the Company determined that there was no future economic value to the associated right-of-use asset and recognized a full impairment loss of $146,795 on August 1, 2020. As of April 14, 2022, the Company has not reached an agreement with RN Holdings Ltd to modify or to settle the remaining contractual liability, which therefore remains recorded as of December 31, 2021 under its original contractual terms.
