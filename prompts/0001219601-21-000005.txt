PRODUCTS
Beverage Cans and Glass Bottles
The Company supplies beverage cans and ends and other packaging products to a variety of beverage and beer companies, including Anheuser-Busch InBev, Coca-Cola, Keurig Dr Pepper, Heineken, Molson Coors, Pepsi-Cola and Refresco, among others. The Company’s beverage can business is built around local, regional and global markets, which has served to develop the Company’s understanding of global customer and consumer expectations. The Company's glass bottle business is based in Mexico and serves customers primarily in the local market. 
The beverage market is dynamic and highly competitive, with each packaging manufacturer working together with its customers to satisfy consumers’ ever-changing needs. The Company competes by offering its customers broad market knowledge, resources at all levels of its worldwide organization and extensive research and development capabilities that have enabled the Company to provide its customers with innovative products. The Company meets its customers’ beverage packaging needs with an array of two-piece beverage cans and ends and metal bottle caps. Innovations include the SuperEnd® and 360 End™ beverage can ends, and size variations. Size variations include slim and sleek cans for portion control, low calorie products or other product differentiation, as well as larger sizes for high volume consumption. The Company expects to continue to add capacity in many of its growing markets around the world.
Beverage can and glass bottle manufacturing is capital intensive, requiring significant investment in tools and machinery. The Company seeks to effectively manage its invested capital and is continuing its efforts to reduce the metal content of its cans and reduce non-metal costs, including water and energy usage, while improving production processes.
Food Cans and Closures
The Company manufactures a variety of food cans and ends, including two-piece and three-piece cans in assorted shapes and sizes, and sells food cans to food marketers such as Abbott Laboratories, Bonduelle, Morgan Foods, Nestlé, Princes Group and Simmons Foods, among others. The Company offers a wide variety of metal vacuum closures and sealing equipment solutions to leading marketers such as Abbott Laboratories, Danone, Nestlé and Unilever, among others, from a network of metal vacuum closure plants around the world. The Company supplies total packaging solutions, including metal and composite closures, 
Crown Holdings, Inc.

capping systems and services while working closely with customers, retailers and glass and plastic container manufacturers to develop innovative closure solutions and meet customer requirements.
Technologies used to produce food cans include three-piece welded, two-piece drawn and wall-ironed and two-piece drawn and redrawn. The Company also offers its LIFTOFF™ series of food ends, including its Easylift™ full aperture steel food can ends, and PeelSeam™ and PeelFit™ flexible aluminum foil laminated ends. The Company offers expertise in closure design and decoration, ranging from quality printing of the closure in up to nine colors, to inside-the-cap printing, which offers customers new promotional possibilities, to better product protection through Ideal Closures™, Orbit™ and Superplus™. The Company’s commitment to innovation has led to developments in packaging materials, surface finishes, can shaping, lithography, filling, retorting, sealing and opening techniques and environmental performance. The Company manufactures easy open, vacuum and conventional ends for a variety of heat-processed and dry food products including fruits and vegetables, meat and seafood, soups, ready-made meals, infant formula, coffee and pet food.
Transit Packaging
The Company's transit packaging products are used to contain, unitize, and protect goods during manufacturing, transport, and warehousing and are sold around the world under a broad array of well-known brand names such as Signode, Strapex, Orgapack, Shippers Airbags, Angleboard, and MIMA. The Company serves diverse end markets, including metals, food and beverage, construction, agricultural, corrugated and general industrial. The Company's long operational history has resulted in a large base of equipment, which drives recurring revenue through the sale of consumables, parts and service offerings and future equipment replacement sales. The Company's customer concentration is low.
Aerosol Cans
The Company’s customers for aerosol cans and ends include manufacturers of personal care, food, household and industrial products, including FrieslandCampina, Procter & Gamble, S.C. Johnson and Unilever, among others. The aerosol can business is highly competitive. The Company competes by offering its customers a broad range of products including multiple sizes, multiple color schemes and shaped packaging.
Promotional and Specialty Packaging
The Company’s promotional and specialty packaging businesses are primarily located in Europe and Asia. The Company produces a wide range of promotional and specialty packaging containers with numerous lid and closure variations. The Company’s customers include Britvic and Nestlé among others.
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
Global marketers qualify suppliers on the basis of their ability to provide global service, innovative designs and technologies in a cost-effective manner.
With its global reach, the Company primarily markets and sells products to customers through its own sales and marketing staffs. In some instances, contracts with customers are centrally negotiated, but products are ordered through and distributed directly by the Company’s local facilities. The Company’s facilities are generally located in proximity to their respective major customers. The Company works closely with customers in order to develop new business and to extend the duration of existing contracts.
Many customers provide the Company with quarterly or annual estimates of product requirements along with related quantities pursuant to which periodic commitments are given. Such estimates assist the Company in managing production and controlling use of working capital. The Company schedules its production to meet customer requirements. Because the production time for the Company’s products is short, any backlog of customer orders in relation to overall sales is not significant.
SEASONALITY
The food packaging business is somewhat seasonal with the first quarter tending to be the slowest period as the autumn packing period in the Northern Hemisphere has ended and new crops are not yet planted. The industry generally enters its busiest period in the third quarter when the majority of fruits and vegetables are harvested and immediately canned. Due to this seasonality, inventory levels increase in the first half of the year to meet peak demand in the second and third quarters. Weather represents a substantial uncertainty in the yield of food products and is a major factor in determining the demand for food cans in any given 
Crown Holdings, Inc.

year. Generally, beverage products are consumed in greater amounts during the warmer months of the year and sales have generally been higher in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. 
The Company’s other businesses tend not to be as significantly affected by seasonal variations.
COMPETITION
Most of the Company’s packaging products for consumer goods are sold in highly competitive markets, primarily based on price, quality, service and performance. The Company competes with other packaging manufacturers as well as with fillers, food processors and packers, some of whom manufacture containers for their own use and for sale to others. The Company’s competitors include, but are not limited to, Ardagh Group, Ball Corporation, Ball Metalpack, Mauser Packaging Solutions, Can-Pack S.A., Metal Container Corporation, Silgan Holdings Inc., and Trivium Packaging.
The Transit Packaging Division also faces substantial competition from many regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of its products. The division differentiates itself from the competition by leveraging its global scale, broad product portfolio and established brand reputation. The division's products compete, to some extent, with various other packaging materials, including other products made of paper, plastics, wood and various types of metal.
CUSTOMERS
The Company’s largest customers consist of many of the leading manufacturers and marketers of packaged consumer products in the world. Consolidation trends among beverage and food marketers have led to a concentrated customer base. The Company’s top ten global customers represented in the aggregate approximately 31% of its 2020 net sales. In each of the years in the period 2018 through 2020, no one customer accounted for more than ten percent of the Company’s net sales. Each operating segment, with the exception of the Transit Packaging Segment, has major customers and the loss of one or more of these major customers could have a material adverse effect on an individual segment or the Company as a whole. Major customers include those listed above under the caption "Products". In addition to sales to Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, the Company also supplies independent licensees of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Company's principal Research, Development & Engineering ("RD&E") Centers for packaging products for consumer goods are located in Alsip, Illinois and Wantage, United Kingdom. The Company utilizes its centralized corporate RD&E capabilities to advance and deliver technologies for the Company's worldwide packaging activities that (1) promote development of value-added metal packaging systems for its customers, (2) design cost-efficient manufacturing processes, systems and materials and material-efficient container designs that further the sustainability of metal packaging, (3) provide continuous quality and/or production efficiency improvements in its manufacturing facilities, (4) advance customer and supplier relationships, and (5) provide value-added engineering services and technical support. These capabilities facilitate (1) the identification of new and/or expanded market opportunities by working directly with customers to develop new packaging products or enhance existing packaging products through the application of new technologies that better differentiate customers' products in the retail environment (for example, the creation of new packaging shapes, novel decoration methods, or the addition of digital content through unique codes) and/or the incorporation of consumer-valued features (for example, improved openability and/or ease of use) and (2) the reduction of manufacturing costs by reducing the material content of the Company's products (while retaining necessary performance characteristics), reducing spoilage, and increasing operating efficiencies in manufacturing facilities. These corporate R&D Centers are also applying their technical expertise to advance product design and manufacturing capabilities for the Company's Transit Packaging Division, supplementing their existing divisional product developments.
The Company maintains a substantial portfolio of patents and other intellectual property ("IP") in the field of metal packaging systems and seeks strategic partnerships to extend its IP in existing and emerging markets. As a result, the Company has licensed IP in geographic regions where the Company has a limited market presence today. Existing technologies such as SuperEnd® beverage ends, 360 End™ beverage ends, Easy-Flow™ beverage ends, Eole™ easy-open food ends and can shaping have been licensed in Australia, Japan, and Africa to provide customers with global access to Crown's brand building innovations.
The Transit Packaging Division is well known throughout its markets for its ability to drive product innovation and leadership in new technologies. The division focuses on market driven innovation and has a long history of creating product and service solutions that solve problems and create value for its customers. The division's platforms are primarily responsible for designing and executing their own research and development projects and the division's development process is comprised of a 
Crown Holdings, Inc.

customer-oriented, "outside-in" approach. The division works with customers to determine their most pressing industrial packaging challenges, utilizing a rigorous multi-step product development process to ensure that they shape the ultimate product for both the customer and the broader market. Transit Packaging's track record of new product innovation is largely due to the success of this model.
The Transit Packaging Division has been an industry leader in industrial packaging innovation over the last 100 years as evidenced by their introduction of the first strap packaging product (1913), the first fully-automatic strapping machine (1946), the industry's first battery operated plastic strap hand tools (1995), and most recently the industry's first battery-operated steel strap hand tools (2013). At the core of its intellectual property strategy is a focus on obtaining quality patents that cover key products and technologies, in alignment with its business objectives. The Transit Packaging Division has grown its global patent portfolio to over 330 United States issued patents or pending patent applications and over 1,110 foreign issued patents or pending patent applications. The portfolio broadly covers about 335 customized technologies and spans diverse business platforms, as well as the different countries in which it operates. 
The Company spent $53 million in 2020, $55 million in 2019, and $51 million in 2018 in its RD&E activities. Certain of these activities are expected to improve and expand the Company's product lines in the future. These expenditures include projects to improve manufacturing efficiencies, reduce unit costs, and develop new and improved value-added packaging systems. 
MATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS
The Company uses various raw materials, primarily aluminum and steel, in its manufacturing operations. The Transit Packaging division also uses materials derived from crude oil and natural gas, such as polyethylene and polypropylene. In general, these raw materials are purchased in highly competitive, price-sensitive markets, which have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. These and other materials used in the manufacturing process have historically been available in adequate supply from multiple sources.
The Company has agreements for what it considers adequate supplies of raw materials. However, sufficient quantities may not be available in the future due to, among other things, shortages due to excessive demand, weather or other factors, including disruptions in supply caused by raw material transportation or production delays. From time to time, some of the raw materials have been in short supply but, to date, these shortages have not had a significant impact on the Company’s operations.
In 2020, consumption of steel and aluminum represented 16% and 35% of consolidated cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization. Due to the significance of these raw materials to the overall cost of products sold, raw material efficiency is a critical cost component of the products manufactured. Supplier consolidations, changes in ownership, government regulations, political unrest and increased demand for raw materials in the packaging and other industries, among other risk factors, could cause uncertainty as to the availability of and the level of prices at which the Company might be able to source such raw materials in the future. Moreover, the prices of aluminum and steel can be subject to significant volatility. The Company’s raw material supply contracts vary as to terms and duration, with steel contracts typically one year in duration with fixed prices or set repricing dates, and aluminum contracts typically multi-year in duration with fluctuating prices based on aluminum ingot costs. The Company generally attempts to mitigate its steel and aluminum price risk by matching its purchase obligations with its sales agreements; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to fully mitigate that risk.
The Company also uses commodity and foreign currency forwards in an attempt to manage its exposure to aluminum price volatility.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to fully recover from its customers the impact of aluminum and steel price increases or that the use of derivative instruments will effectively manage the Company’s exposure to price volatility. In addition, if the Company were unable to purchase steel and aluminum for a significant period of time, its operations would be disrupted, and if the Company were unable to fully recover the higher cost of steel and aluminum, its financial results may be adversely affected. As a result of continuing global supply and demand pressures, other commodity-related costs affecting the Company’s business may increase as well, including utility and freight-related costs. The Company will attempt to increase prices on its products accordingly in order to recover these costs. Certain of the Company's sales contracts contain non-metal pass-through provisions that include annual selling price adjustments based on a producer price index. In certain years the referenced index may be negative, requiring the Company to reduce its selling price while its actual costs may have increased.
In response to the volatility of raw material prices, ongoing productivity and cost reduction efforts in recent years have focused on improving raw material cost management. The Company’s manufacturing facilities are dependent, in varying degrees, upon the availability of water and processed energy, such as natural gas and electricity. Certain of these may become difficult or 
Crown Holdings, Inc.

impossible to obtain on acceptable terms due to external factors, which could increase the Company’s costs or interrupt its business.
Aluminum and steel, by their very nature, can be recycled at high effectiveness and can be repeatedly reused to form new consumer packaging with minimal or no degradation in performance, quality or safety. By recycling these metals, large amounts of energy can be saved and significant water use and carbon dioxide emissions avoided.
SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company has a Corporate Sustainability Policy and a Corporate Environmental Protection Policy. In addition, in 2020, the Company debuted its Twentyby30 program, which creates an opportunity for the Company to move beyond the challenges of addressing regulatory and supply chain disruption risks caused by environmental, social and governance ("ESG") concerns. The program identifies five distinct pillars of action - Climate Action, Resource Efficiency, Optimum Circularity, Working Together and Never Compromise - that represent topics of urgent global concern and areas of the business in which the Company can create notable impact and twenty measurable ESG goals to be completed by 2030 or sooner. A key aspect to the Company's success lies with the fact that the Company's primary material, metal, supports a circular economy and protects the customers' products by delivering outstanding shelf life. 
Environmental considerations are among the criteria by which the Company evaluates projects, products, processes and purchases. The Company is committed to continuous improvement in product design and manufacturing practices to provide the best outcome for the human and natural environment, both now and in the future. By reducing the per-unit amount of raw materials used in manufacturing its products, the Company can significantly reduce the amount of energy, water and other resources and associated emissions necessary to manufacture metal containers. The Company aims to continue that process of improvement in its manufacturing process to assure that consumers and the environment are best served through the use of its products. 
The Company’s operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, disposal of waste, discharges into water, emissions into the atmosphere and the protection of employee health and safety. Future regulations may impose stricter environmental requirements on the packaging industry and may require additional capital investment. Anticipated future restrictions in some jurisdictions on the use of certain coatings may require the Company to employ additional control equipment or process modifications. 
There can be no assurance that current or future environmental laws or liabilities will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Discussion of the Company’s environmental matters is contained within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report under the caption “Environmental Matters,” and under Note O to the consolidated financial statements.
HUMAN CAPITAL
At December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately 33,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 7,500 employed by the Americas Division, 12,000 employed by the European Division, 4,500 employed by the Asia Pacific Division and 8,500 employed by the Transit Packaging Division. 
A significant portion of the Company’s workforce is unionized. Collective bargaining agreements with varying terms and expiration dates cover approximately 18,000 employees. The Company has experienced no union-initiated work stoppages during the 2020 fiscal year and believes that its employee relations remain good. The Company does not expect that renegotiation of any collective bargaining agreements expiring in 2021 will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow. 
The Company believes that its employees are key to achieving the Company’s business goals and growth strategy. Attracting, developing and retaining the best people globally is crucial to all aspects of the Company’s activities. Towards this end, the Company has cultivated a senior management team with extensive industry experience and highly specialized skills and has consistently re‑invested in necessary resources to effectively staff and efficiently support its businesses. The Company aspires to offer market rate competitive salaries for the regions in which it operates, and to engage employees with rewarding opportunities to contribute to the Company’s success.
The Company is committed to the health and safety of its employees and their families. Since the outbreak of coronavirus (also known as COVID-19), the Company has taken specific actions to ensure the safety of its employees. The Company’s COVID-19 Task Teams have been actively monitoring scientific developments and government actions related to the virus; 
Crown Holdings, Inc.

instituting policies and procedures to minimize risk for the Company’s global team members and facilities and to enable the Company to continue serving its customers in a safe and timely manner; sharing information with the workforce about the virus and actions to prevent its spread; and assisting staff in their efforts to get vaccinated. Beginning with the implementation of travel and visitor restrictions in February 2020, the Company has updated many of its policies to adapt to the pandemic environment. The Company has taken increased safety measures in its manufacturing facilities to ensure the safety of employees and the products they produce. The Company adheres to the latest updates from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, as well as the directives of local authorities, and has implemented a variety of other precautionary measures, including expanding remote working to as many employees as possible.
In addition to the Company’s COVID-19 efforts, the Company supports the well-being of its employees and their families with a variety of physical, mental and social wellness programs. These programs differ by region, but include Company-sponsored or subsidized medical insurance over and above government provisions, annual medical, cancer and audiometry screenings, voluntary health fairs and employee assistance programs to improve health and wellness. The Company has built a Total Safety Culture that provides the framework for all health and safety initiatives across the Company and empowers employees to take a proactive role in their safety and that of their peers. The Company’s focus is on behaviors and attitudes and achieving success in incident, injury and near-miss reductions. The Company’s Twentyby30 program includes a goal to reduce the Total Recordable Incident Rate by 20% by 2025.
The Company recognizes that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to its future business success. It has therefore integrated Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) as a dimension of its Twentyby30 sustainability program aiming first to embed D&I awareness in its organizational culture. The Company believes different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives generate powerful new ideas and foster good and sustainable decision making. The Company’s approach includes deployment of D&I training initiatives, such as psychological safety and Unconscious Bias trainings, improvement of its recruitment and onboarding processes including D&I principles and promotion of a positive work environment through policies, guidelines and practices that consider D&I. The Company is establishing Divisional D&I Committees to facilitate this cultural and organizational awareness.
The Company places a high value on skills management and lifelong learning opportunities that benefit both the individual employee and the whole Company. The Company provides a variety of educational opportunities, including a mix of mandatory and voluntary training programs that occur in classrooms, online or on the job. The Company also recognizes the importance of multifunctional teams and as such, management training includes international exposure and cross divisional activity to develop common approaches and values. Talent development programs vary by region, but include leadership programs designed to support operations leadership, lean manufacturing operations and employee performance management. 
The Company maintains a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics documenting its policies with respect to, among other things, anti-corruption, confidential information, and environmental, health and safety, as well as the Company’s commitment to ensuring that all of its employees are treated with respect and dignity and are able to work in an environment free from all forms of unlawful employment discrimination. The Company’s Compliance Teams are responsible for implementing these policies, and provide a mechanism for employees to report suspected violations of Company policies on a confidential basis, including anonymous reporting where permitted by local law.
WORKING CAPITAL
The Company generally uses cash during the first nine months of the year to finance seasonal working capital needs. The Company’s working capital requirements are funded by cash flows from operations, revolving credit facilities and receivables securitization and factoring programs.
