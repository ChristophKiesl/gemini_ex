Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 
Avalara is a leading provider of tax compliance automation for businesses of all sizes. Every business, regardless of size, faces a bewildering and burdensome array of constantly shifting transaction tax collection, reporting and remittance obligations imposed by a patchwork of local, regional, state, and national taxing authorities. The rise of omnichannel commerce and international trade has increased this compliance burden. Avalara’s mission is to eliminate this burden and allow companies to focus on their core operations. We offer a leading suite of cloud-based solutions to assist companies with transactional tax and related compliance requirements. This multi-product platform – the Avalara Compliance Cloud – consists of calculation, returns, compliance document management, licensing and registration, tax content, and insight solutions. Our vision is for the Avalara Compliance Cloud to be the leading, category-defining, global cloud compliance platform.
 The changes in global economies and technology adoption are generational shifts in favor of Avalara’s compliance automation business. Increases in digital commerce and ongoing adoption of cloud technologies are behavior and productivity shifts that we expect to continue indefinitely. Alongside mounting regulatory change and government adoption of technology for fiscal transparency and efficiency, businesses around the world are looking for efficient, automated processes to mitigate risk and facilitate growth.
 Transaction tax rules and regulations change frequently and are neither intuitive nor consistent across taxing jurisdictions, creating a massively complex compliance challenge. Determining the tax due on a particular sale depends not only on the precise geographic location of the transaction within relevant taxing jurisdictions and classifying the product or service into one of thousands of taxation categories, it also can vary based on the date of the transaction because of temporary tax incentives that change the tax rate for specific products, time periods, and transaction thresholds. Further complications to this multi-dimensional challenge arise from duties and taxes assessed on goods crossing national borders, and the thousands of rule changes enacted every year as taxing authorities amend their tax rates and taxability rules, modify jurisdictional boundaries, and implement other regulatory changes.
 This complexity is often compounded by the necessity to perform transaction tax determination in real time, at the moment a transaction takes place or an invoice is created, and to determine and collect tax on numerous products or services in multiple jurisdictions. These circumstances are increasingly common with the rise of omnichannel commerce wherein businesses employ multiple channels to conduct sales, ranging from traditional in-store point of sale scenarios to multiple ecommerce platforms to digital marketplaces. Sales in these channels employ disparate transactional systems, each of which may contain their own transaction tax solutions ranging from third-party offerings like Avalara to rudimentary or homegrown capabilities. These basic tax calculation capabilities are often not sufficiently robust or current to provide accurate tax determinations for many businesses; more important, as each exists in a siloed channel, they do not offer businesses the ability to aggregate data across systems to enable efficient compliance. Data from those transactions and the associated taxes collected must be aggregated from each of the various systems to enable complete and accurate reporting, tax form preparation, filing, and remittance to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions. Traditional methods used by most businesses to aggregate and report transactions are burdensome, costly, and inadequate to the task. They involve manual aggregation and manipulation of data from disparate sources, reference to static tables in spreadsheet software, and reliance on internal staff to track relevant requirements and changes as well as to populate tax returns and ensure timely submission and payment.
 Businesses relying on inadequate processes for transaction tax compliance risk miscalculations and incorrect collections on the front end, which can result in customer dissatisfaction, and inaccurate filings and payments to authorities on the back end, which can result in significant financial penalties.
 The Avalara Compliance Cloud combines an advanced database of broad, deep, and up-to-date licensing, registration, and tax content with technology for executing compliance processes, including tax determination, aggregation of transaction data, tax document management, and tax return preparation, filing, and remittance. Our platform powers a suite of products that enables businesses to address the complexity of transaction tax compliance, process transactions in real time, produce records of transaction tax determinations, and reduce errors, audit exposure, and total transaction tax compliance costs. Businesses that use our solutions can allocate fewer personnel to manage transaction tax compliance and focus their efforts on core business operations.
 The Avalara Compliance Cloud is designed to integrate seamlessly with our customers’ business applications and be easy to administer and maintain. As transactions are executed in our customers’ business applications, the Avalara Compliance Cloud performs a series of operations to deliver tax compliance functionality. This

functionality is enabled through an application programming interface (“API”), with customers and partners leveraging our pre-built integrations that connect to business applications used for accounting, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), ecommerce, marketplaces, point of sale (“POS”), recurring billing, and customer relationship management (“CRM”) systems, or developing API calls directly into their systems. These integrations are designed to reduce the need for custom configurations and ongoing oversight by customers. Our cloud architecture ensures that our tax content updates are automatically applied to tax determinations when called by our customers’ applications. Our powerful and intuitive web-based console simplifies configuration and unifies administration, reporting, and returns processing across a customer’s multiple business applications.
 Because our solutions are deeply embedded in our customers’ business processes and systems and provide an automated solution that is central to their ability to transact, we become critical business partners with our customers that foster substantial long-term relationships, as evidenced by our low revenue churn and high net revenue retention rate. 
 Businesses across industries and of all sizes, ranging from small companies to Fortune 100 enterprises, use our solutions. While mid-market and smaller customers, with 20 to 500 employees, have historically been our primary target segment for marketing and selling our solutions, we are focused on extending our customer reach through investments in product and go-to-market capabilities that address the enterprise and emerging small business market segments globally. We believe these markets represent significant long-term future growth opportunities to augment our large mid-market opportunity where we believe we remain minimally penetrated. We have been launching new compliance capabilities aimed at capturing larger shares of these market segments. These include calculating cross-border customs duties and import taxes as well as consumer use taxes, which are imposed by state governments on transactions in which sales tax was not collected correctly or at all. Additionally, we introduced new functionality into our tax calculation service that allows businesses with more complex tax scenarios to customize the rates and rules applied to specific transactions. Our acquisition of Transaction Tax Resources, Inc. (“TTR”) provides inroads to the enterprise market via new customer and partner relationships as well as broadened tax content capabilities. We introduced a new, simplified returns service specifically aimed at small businesses and another for use by accounting firms seeking to extend their transaction tax business and margins. Our acquisition of Business Licenses, LLC (“Business Licenses”) provides new offerings for all market segments, from enterprise customers to emerging small businesses.
 We sell our solutions primarily on a subscription basis. We target most prospects via cost-effective digital marketing strategies and initially qualify them using predictive analytics. The majority of our sales, to new and existing customers, are direct and conducted via telephone, requiring minimal in-person interaction. We expect, as we continue to expand our efforts upmarket to customers with larger and more complex needs, that we may need to resource for higher touch and in-person sales and support efforts. Our small business customers can subscribe to certain of our solutions via an automated, self-service ordering process, and we expect to continue to invest in a lower-touch sales and onboarding process. Our sales force also manages a network of business application providers and other customer referral sources that provide us with qualified leads and, in some cases, purchase functionality from us for use by their customers. We execute marketing programs targeting the ecosystems of these business application providers. 
 We also have acquired multiple businesses, primarily to augment the tax content of the Avalara Compliance Cloud, serve the needs of businesses in different geographies or industries, or improve our ability to serve additional aspects of transaction tax compliance. Substantial portions of our business, including our tax return preparation and filing and our compliance document management solutions, are based on acquired content and technology. Since 2018, we have acquired beverage alcohol tax, cross-border transaction (e.g., tariffs and duties) solutions, and artificial intelligence technology and expertise. In 2020, we acquired TTR and Impendulo Limited (“Impendulo”), as well as the operating assets of Business Licenses. TTR primarily serves enterprise businesses and their internal tax teams, offering U.S. sales and use tax rates, laws, software, and customer support required by the biggest and most complex companies. Impendulo is a London-based provider of insurance tax compliance solutions. Business Licenses provides software and services for the research, procurement, and management of business licenses, registrations, and permits for businesses of all sizes. We intend to continue pursuing opportunities to broaden our suite of solutions, content, and international presence.
 
Industry and Competition 
 
Transaction taxes are ubiquitous and complex, and compliance is increasingly difficult for businesses of all sizes. Businesses, regardless of size, industry, or location, are subject to transaction tax compliance requirements. These requirements can be burdensome, even for a business transacting in only a single location, and become exponentially more complex for companies doing business in multiple taxing jurisdictions and offering numerous products and services that are taxed in different ways.
 3


Transaction tax exists at the intersection of commerce and government, and therefore political, economic, social, and technological changes may impact our business. Shifts happening in these areas today are driving complexity for businesses to manage tax, interest from governments in introducing and enforcing regulation, and businesses to apply technology to drive efficient results in compliance. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rise of ecommerce was an existing tailwind for our business. The pandemic accelerated adoption of online shopping, proving to be a generational shift that introduces tax complexity and drives the need for tax automation for more businesses. Global governments are responding to fiscal challenges by expanding tax requirements to capture more revenue from more businesses, and around the world more tax authorities are adding technological requirements such as live reporting for added transparency into revenue streams. Businesses of all sizes continue to put cloud technologies in place as the digital transformation of business continues, and the demand to facilitate distributed workforces continues. The availability of and trust in these technologies has furthered an emphasis on streamlining business processes to drive efficient growth. Macro trends such as these directly contribute to our value promise of delivering a more efficient technology solution to manage global compliance requirements.
 These trends have accelerated or introduced new compliance challenges for businesses. The responsibility for accurately determining and collecting sales tax generally falls on the seller, who must go through a series of steps to determine the tax applicable to each transaction. When conducted manually, these steps are time consuming, involve complexities that are difficult to manage, and often prone to error. The volume and velocity of ecommerce transactions make manually calculating sales tax in real-time impossible.
 Commerce across multiple jurisdictions increases the burden of transaction tax compliance as a result of the complexity arising from location-by-location, region-by-region, state-by-state, country-by-country, and product-by-product application of tax laws. Ecommerce, electronic marketplaces, globalization, and omnichannel retailing have facilitated cross-jurisdiction transactions for businesses of all sizes, increasing their transaction tax compliance burden and risk and the need for an automated compliance solution.
 Due to the importance of tax revenue, taxing authorities continually seek ways to improve the efficiency, speed, and thoroughness of their collection and enforcement processes. New transaction tax requirements such as those imposed by many states following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair increase complexity for online merchants with geographically distributed customers. Globally, with the rise of online marketplaces, many tax authorities now require marketplace facilitators to consolidate tax reporting and payments for all sellers, adding meaningful complexity in data collection and reporting for the marketplaces and sellers alike. Commercial transaction reporting requirements also are changing, particularly in the international arena, as are registration and licensing obligations. A growing list of countries now require real-time reporting of commercial transactions and payment of tax obligations, and many countries require data integrations with government systems. 
 On the enforcement side, taxing authorities in the U.S. and worldwide have always conducted transaction tax audits to verify accurate and timely collection and payment. These audits can be time consuming and distracting to a business and are costly, including internal and external audit management costs, as well as payment of uncollected taxes, penalties, and interest. As tax revenue needs increase, pressure on collections increases as well. Automated tax compliance solutions improve business compliance efficiency as regulations continue to change, and businesses must adapt to more advanced techniques of identification and tax enforcement. Also, geopolitical changes such as the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (the “E.U.”) have meaningful implications for sellers around the world reaching large markets. New U.K. value-added tax (“VAT”) reporting requirements interrupt established paths and processes to reach these markets and can halt supply chain, fulfillment, and payment processes if not proactively addressed by businesses.
 Many businesses attempt to handle transaction tax compliance processes manually, risking miscalculations and incorrect collections, which can result in customer dissatisfaction and/or financial penalties. Some businesses supplement their internal manual efforts with costly outsourced professional service firms to perform tax compliance functions. Many businesses process transactions using business applications such as accounting, ERP, ecommerce, marketplace, POS, recurring billing, and CRM systems. These systems sometimes include rudimentary tax calculation capabilities, but they are usually not sufficiently robust or current to provide accurate tax determinations. 
 The industry that provides support for transaction tax compliance is highly competitive and fragmented, but it is maturing. Rising complexity and increasing need for automated solutions have resulted in greater awareness of external solutions and there are now multiple public companies offering automated tax compliance solutions. Avalara believes that, in the age of digital commerce, it is inevitable that all businesses will adopt automated solutions to tax compliance over time. Until then, businesses will continue to employ a mix of approaches to address transaction tax compliance, including:
  
• | tax-specific solutions from vendors, including Avalara, but also Sovos, TPS Unlimited, Inc. d/b/a TaxJar, Thomson Reuters, Vertex, Inc., and Wolters Kluwer NV;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | rudimentary tax calculator services and/or people-intensive, do-it-yourself approaches that rely on internal transaction-specific research and/or purchase of tax content information from third parties, manual determination, static tax tables, spreadsheet software, or rate calculator services, as well as manual filing and remittance activities; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | outsourced transaction tax compliance services offered by accounting and specialized consulting firms.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe customers, including customers that are business applications providers, consider the following factors when selecting a transaction tax compliance solution:
  
• | ability to improve overall transaction tax compliance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to deliver real-time tax determinations;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | ease of deployment and use;
--+----------------------------


• | ease of integration with the customer’s business applications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to integrate with and aggregate data across multiple business applications to satisfy compliance for omnichannel commerce;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to address multiple compliance functions from registration and licensing, initial taxability, and tax rate determination to procurement and management of compliance-related documents to preparation and filing of tax returns and remittance of funds;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | total cost of ownership; and
--+-----------------------------


• | tax content applicable to the customer’s business.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 
Although different customers will weigh each of these factors in different ways, we believe our cloud-based solutions compare favorably across all of them. While Avalara’s services historically were designed for mid-market and small businesses, recent enhancements to our product and service offerings, along with business acquisitions, have broadened our appeal to both the emerging small business and enterprise market segments. There is always room for further improvement and Avalara continues to pursue new functionalities, service offerings, pricing structures, and additional content and integrations to strengthen our competitive position.

Products and Solutions 
 We offer a broad suite of solutions for transaction tax and complementary compliance requirements. Our solutions can be purchased individually or as an integrated compliance suite. We organize our solutions in six product categories that represent the core requirements for achieving compliance.
 Calculations. Avalara’s calculation products determine tax rates for transactions based on data and logic within our tax and product content database, which are then populated into our customers’ business applications. Certain Avalara calculations products are unique to a customer’s industry, including fuel and beverage alcohol excise, insurance premium, lodging, and communications taxes. Transaction tax calculation is also regionally specific, and we provide VAT and GST products for international customers and cross-border solutions for customs duties and import taxes. Calculation products are generally sold on an annual subscription basis and many times as part of an integrated solution with other products, including returns and compliance document management. Calculations are primarily delivered through cloud-based deployments but can also be deployed on-premises. 
 Returns and Reporting. Avalara’s tax returns and reporting products manage and automate the returns process, from form and data preparation to filing to remittance of funds to tax authorities. The products track filing calendars and deadlines, manage requirements for each of the customer’s required jurisdictions, and facilitate the payment process. For those customers that purchase calculations and returns products, Avalara’s integrated solution leverages stored transaction data from the calculation product to populate returns forms. Avalara offers returns products specialized for certain tax types, including sales and use, VAT, fuel and beverage alcohol excise, insurance premium, lodging, and communications taxes. For many of the returns types supported by Avalara, we also offer to execute the remittance of tax collections to the taxing authorities. Avalara is also a certified service provider in the Streamlined Sales Tax (“SST”) program, which is an initiative by certain U.S. state and local governments to simplify sales tax compliance for qualifying businesses. The capabilities required of a returns product can vary by business size or type, therefore Avalara offers additional returns solutions tailored for small businesses and accounting firms. Around the world, returns and reporting vary by region and the government’s adoption of technology within the reporting processes. Avalara is expanding solutions for businesses to comply with live reporting and e-invoicing requirements in Europe, India, and Brazil. Our returns products are available integrated and embedded with calculations products, offered on a standalone managed basis, or accessed online via a self-serve web tool. Returns products are generally sold on an annual subscription basis and can be purchased on a per filing basis.
 Compliance Document Management. Avalara’s compliance document management products automate the creation, sending, receiving, storage, and management of a variety of documents required for compliance through a cloud-based solution. Businesses are required to collect and maintain numerous official forms, including tax exemption certificates, W-8 forms, W-9 forms, 1099 forms for contractors, power of attorney forms, and other tax-related forms for identification such as passports and drivers’ licenses. The solutions make tax documents available for easy retrieval and help our customers keep them up to date and validated. The solutions also limit our customers’ audit exposure by establishing an audit trail for tax exempt transactions and other audit scenarios. We offer a specific product for fuel excise document requirements, as well as a regional product for customers doing business in Brazil. Compliance document management products are sold as part of a compliance suite with calculation and returns products, or as a standalone product. These products are generally sold on an annual subscription basis with optional managed services to assist customers with collecting and validating documents.
 6


Licensing and Registrations. Avalara’s licensing products and services support businesses of all sizes in the research, procurement, and maintenance of business licenses, registrations, and permits. These products also help customers acquire country, state, and local transactional tax registrations. For global businesses, Avalara offers a service to assist businesses selling internationally to obtain and maintain VAT registrations, a pre-requisite process to collecting, reporting, and remitting VAT payments in required jurisdictions. Licensing and registrations products and services can be purchased standalone on an as-needed basis, or as a subscription for ongoing management, maintenance, and storage of business licenses.
 Fiscal Representation. To address the requirement of businesses to have a local fiscal representative in foreign jurisdictions when transacting outside of their home country, Avalara offers fiscal representation services, acting as the responsible party and point of contact for local tax authorities in case of questions or audits. Avalara fiscal representative services are generally sold on a subscription basis.
 Content, Data, and Insights. Avalara content, data, and insights products leverage Avalara’s tax and content databases to produce actionable, detailed insights, which tax and finance professionals use to make informed decisions about tax compliance and financial planning. Avalara offers tax content subscriptions that allow customers to research tax rates and taxability explanations, and also provide access to tax rate explanations and legal documentation that customers can use to plan or defend tax decisions. Through Avalara’s classification services, customers can identify and align their product databases to Avalara’s proprietary tax codes, harmonized system codes, universal product codes, and other tax classifications. By providing past transaction data, customers can leverage Avalara’s risk assessment tools to analyze where they may be obligated to collect and remit sales tax. Additionally, Avalara offers content generation products specialized for industry platforms such as point of sale systems for retailers. Content, data, and insight products are sold as subscriptions or on an as-needed basis.
 In addition to our cloud solutions, a small percentage of our revenue is derived from a broad range of specialized tax compliance services that we deliver on a standalone basis or in conjunction with the sale or implementation of our cloud solutions. These services include such projects as nexus studies and analysis, voluntary compliance initiatives, complex tax registrations, reverse audits, audit defense, and specialized tax research. 
 Competitive Moats 
 Our competitive moats include:
 Partner moat. We and our partners invest in developing and maintaining an extensive collection of pre-built integrations that are designed to connect our solutions to a broad range of leading business applications, including accounting, ERP, ecommerce, marketplace, POS, recurring billing, and CRM systems. We believe these integrations provide a competitive advantage as they dramatically reduce implementation time, effort, and cost; enable our solutions to function seamlessly with the core applications our customers use to process and manage their transactions; and allow customers to easily and efficiently manage tax compliance across multiple business applications. We offer far more pre-built integrations with these applications than other tax software providers, and we plan to continue adding more. We have pre-built integrations with leading business application providers such as Magento, Intuit QuickBooks, Microsoft, NetSuite, Sage, 3dcart, Salesforce Commerce Cloud, and Epicor. In addition, we have relationships with ecommerce platform providers, including BigCommerce, Shopify, and others, that include our pre-built integrations in their platforms, allowing customers to easily choose our solutions to automate transaction tax calculations.
 We have strategically built a broad ecosystem of relationships with our network of business application publishers (including ecommerce platforms) and their reseller channels, integration developers, implementation specialists, and accounting and financial advisors. These relationships provide us with an effective distribution channel, the majority of our pre-built integrations, a source of referral business, occasions for cross-selling, new opportunities for compliance automation, and early access to developing technologies.
 Content moat. We have amassed, expanded, and integrated an extensive database of statutory tax content, including product classifications and taxability rules, exemption conditions, tax holidays, jurisdiction boundaries, tax rates, thresholds, licenses and registrations, and returns preparation and filing requirements, as well as millions of UPCs, linked to taxability rules. We employ a large group of tax research analysts and utilize artificial intelligence to continually update this library, which is processed by our calculation engine and delivered to our customers via our integrations. In addition to internal development, we have acquired multiple transaction tax-related businesses and acquired or licensed databases containing deep stores of knowledge to augment the tax content that supports our products. In 2020, we acquired TTR, whose core business is a sales tax content subscription service for tax professionals to determine and validate tax decisions and avoid costly mistakes. The content required for TTR’s subscription services extends our content database to include detailed research and 
 7


documentation. We also have built and acquired a library of thousands of local, regional, state, and national tax return forms, tax exemption certificate forms, VAT and GST invoice templates, business license and registration forms, and other compliance documents. Our extensive tax content and forms databases enable us to serve the compliance needs of an ever-expanding list of businesses in different size segments, geographies, and industries such as fuel, communications, beverage alcohol, and lodging.
 Platform and technology moat. Our proprietary platform was born in the cloud and offers a comprehensive and integrated set of transaction tax compliance solutions that enable our customers to automate and more efficiently manage their compliance processes. Our platform combines an extensive proprietary database containing tax jurisdiction boundaries, tax rates, product- and date-specific taxability rules, and return preparation and filing requirements, with advanced algorithms for precise real-time address validation via geolocation technology, application of taxability rules, tax determination, tax return preparation and filing, tax remittance, and tax forms and records management. Our platform processes billions of tax determinations and millions of returns per year, with speed, reliability, and security capabilities designed to serve the needs of even the largest of enterprise customers.
 On our platform, we provide a comprehensive and expanding suite of solutions to address a full range of transaction tax compliance burdens and use cases for tax determination and reporting compliance across multiple tax paradigms including sales tax, VAT, and GST; determination of cross-border customs duties and import taxes; determination of use tax obligations; in addition to several other compliance requirements such as managing exemption certificates, and business licenses and registrations.
 Our solutions can be configured and managed using our intuitive administrative consoles, which we regard as a significant differentiator from other transaction tax services because they facilitate fast and easy company-specific configuration, detailed transaction analysis, and access to detailed reports, worksheets, calendars, and other management functions. The consoles also provide a single point of management for various compliance solutions, scale as a customer’s needs grow or change, and automatically aggregate transactions from multiple business applications. We believe our comprehensive solutions enable us to provide added value to our customers, increase their loyalty and satisfaction, and raise their potential long-term value to us.
 
Growth Strategies 
 
We plan to continue investing to provide our customers with best-in-class solutions and to expand our market opportunity. Our primary growth strategies include:
  
• | Broaden our base of customers. We believe that the market for comprehensive, automated transaction tax compliance solutions is large and underserved, and therefore, we can significantly increase our customer base. Avalara will continue to focus on expanding our leadership and market share in the mid-market, and also will continue to introduce new solutions and tax content for the enterprise and emerging small business segments, globally. As businesses of all sizes expand their product and jurisdictional footprints, we believe the need for cost-effective transaction tax compliance solutions increases. We will continue to invest in our sales and marketing efforts, both domestically and internationally, and intend to expand into new markets to grow our customer base.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow revenue from our existing customers. Many of our customers begin with a single solution, such as our AvaTax sales tax determination solution. This initial entry point establishes Avalara as a trusted part of a customer’s financial processes, and as a customer’s sales increase and the number of transactions processed grows, our volume-based subscription model generates more revenue. The initial entry point also provides us with significant cross-sell opportunities, including tax return preparation, filing and remittance, tax exemption certificate and other compliance documents management, expanded determination solutions for use tax, cross-border trade and international VAT and GST tax regimes, and businesses licenses and registrations. These solutions work together to provide customers with a comprehensive automated solution for their global transaction tax compliance needs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand and deepen our partner ecosystem. We have an extensive network of business application providers and other customer referral sources that provides us with qualified leads and new customer opportunities. In some cases, providers purchase functionality from us for use by their customers. We intend to continue to expand our partner ecosystem by actively seeking new relationships that offer exposure to potential customers and integrations with more business applications. We also undertake considerable effort to expand and maximize our relationships with key partners, providing new monetization opportunities and penetration into increasing percentages of each partner’s customer base.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Expand international reach. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand our suite of solutions and serve more businesses operating outside of the United States. We currently support transaction tax compliance in Canada, Europe, South America, and Asia. In 2020, we launched new or enhanced products for cross-border customs duties and import taxes and advanced our solutions for VAT and GST. We plan to continue investing in these geographies, while also expanding our solutions and growing our sales force to expand into new regions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broaden our content and suite of solutions. We devote substantial resources to continuously improve the Avalara Compliance Cloud, add innovative new features and functionalities, add content, build technology to support new content types, and improve the user experience for our solutions. We intend to continue to make significant investments organically and through acquisitions to build relevant content and expertise to best serve the transaction tax compliance needs of our customers. For example, in recent years we have acquired content and solutions for fuel and alcohol excise tax, European insurance premium tax, lodging tax, communications tax, European VAT, and Brazilian tax; cross-border transaction (e.g., tariffs and duties) solutions; business licensing and registrations; and artificial intelligence technology and expertise. These acquisitions accelerate the expansion of our tax content, solutions, customer base, cross-selling opportunities, and geographic reach. We intend to continue pursuing opportunities to build new capabilities internally and to acquire additional businesses and technologies that align with our strategic objectives.

Customers
 
Businesses across industries and of all sizes, ranging from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies, use our solutions. While mid-market and smaller customers, with 20 to 500 employees, have historically been our primary target market segment for marketing and selling our solutions, we are focused on increasing our market share and global customer reach through investments in product and go-to-market capabilities that address the enterprise and emerging small business market segments globally. We believe these markets represent significant long-term future growth opportunities to augment our large mid-market opportunity where we believe we remain minimally penetrated. In 2020, we launched several new compliance capabilities aimed at capturing larger shares of these market segments. These include calculating cross-border customs duties and import taxes as well as consumer use taxes, which are imposed by state governments on transactions in which sales tax was not collected correctly or at all. Additionally, we introduced new functionality into our tax calculation service that allows larger businesses with more complex tax scenarios to customize the rates and rules applied to specific transactions. And our TTR acquisition provides inroads to the enterprise market via new customer and partner relationships as well as broadened tax content capabilities. We introduced a new, simplified returns service specifically aimed at small businesses and another for use by accounting firms seeking to extend their transaction tax business and margins. Our acquisition of Business Licenses provides new offerings for all market segments, from enterprise customers to emerging small businesses.
 We monetize our solutions through direct sales to customers and via certain partners, such as ecommerce platform partners, that include some of our solutions in their offerings and pay us for usage by their end customers. These platform customers may be core customers to Avalara, and their end-user customers represent opportunities to upsell additional products and become direct customers of Avalara over time. We use core customers as the primary metric for our current customer count reporting. As of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had approximately 14,890, 12,150, and 9,150 core customers, respectively.
 We define a core customer as:
 
 
• | a unique account identifier in our billing system (multiple companies or divisions within a single consolidated enterprise that each have a separate unique account identifier are each treated as separate customers);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that is active as of the measurement date; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | for which we have recognized, as of the measurement date, greater than $3,000 in total revenue during the previous twelve months.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Currently, our core customer count includes only customers with unique account identifiers in our primary U.S. billing systems and does not include customers that subscribe to our solutions through our international subsidiaries or certain legacy and acquired billing systems that have not been integrated into our primary U.S. billing

systems (e.g., recent acquisitions and our lodging tax compliance solution). While most of our revenue is currently generated by customers located in the United States, we support transaction tax compliance and registration in Canada, Europe, South America, and Asia, and we are continuing to expand our international presence. As we increase our international operations and sales in future periods, we may add customers billed from our international subsidiaries to the core customer metric.
 We also have a substantial number of customers of various sizes that do not meet the revenue threshold to be considered a core customer. Many of these customers are in the emerging and small business segment of the marketplace, which represents strategic value and a growth opportunity for us. Customers who do not meet the revenue threshold to be considered a core customer provide us with market share and awareness, and we anticipate that some may grow into core customers. In addition, we have larger customers that are early in their adoption or only utilize our services for small segments of their business, providing opportunities over time for us to extend our relationship and make them core customers.
 In addition to customers with whom we have a direct relationship, some of our customers are business application publishers (including ecommerce platforms) that include automated tax determination powered by Avalara. While those platform customers may be core customers to Avalara, their end-user customers generally are not.
 A summary of our core customers and net revenue retention rate is as follows:
  
 | Dec 31, 2020 | | Sep 30, 2020 | | Jun 30, 2020 | Mar 31, 2020 | Dec 31, 2019 | | Sep 30, 2019 | | Jun 30, 2019 | Mar 31, 2019
--------------------------------------------------------+--------------+--------+--------------+--------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------+--------------+--------+--------------+-------------
Number of core customers (as of end of period) | | 14,890 | | 14,180 | | 13,560 | | 12,940 | | 12,150 | | 11,400 | 10,560 | 9,800
Net revenue retention rate | 104% | | 108% | | 107% | 109% | 111% | | 113% | | 111% | 107%

Sales and Marketing 
 
We sell our solutions primarily on a subscription basis with volume-based pricing. Our solutions are capable of addressing the transaction tax compliance needs of businesses of all sizes, from the smallest sole proprietors to Fortune 100 enterprises. While Avalara started by selling primarily to mid-market and small businesses, growth opportunity and customer need has expanded our reach into enterprise and emerging small businesses. To grow in these areas and expand beyond the mid-market, Avalara invests in specialized go-to-market strategies for sales and marketing unique to each segment.
 While we generally identify and engage directly with our prospective customers, we leverage the sales and referral resources of a broad ecosystem of partners across all market segments. These partners include technology partners, systems integrators, and accounting firms. This ecosystem provides us with qualified leads through a variety of incentive programs. In some cases, providers purchase functionality from us for use by their customers, and we market our additional services to those end users. Additionally, we actively conduct programs to engage with state regulators, tax and accounting firms, payroll vendors, and financial services providers. In some cases, we use customer data obtained from our products or tools to help our customers anticipate compliance requirements and trigger expanded product adoption, such as the procurement of new business licenses in new regions, or risk assessment tools for economic nexus. 
 The majority of our mid-market and small business sales are conducted via telephone, requiring few to no in-person interactions with customer prospects. We target prospects via an omnichannel marketing program, including paid and unpaid digital advertising, direct mail, event marketing, account-based marketing, content marketing, prospect database nurturing, and other digital marketing activities. We also engage in awareness advertising activities using traditional print and electronic media.

In addition to reaching highly targeted enterprise and mid-market prospects, our marketing investments and activities generate interest from large numbers of emerging and small businesses that also are burdened by transaction tax compliance requirements. Emerging and small business customers can purchase and configure smaller plans at lower price points through our self-service online marketplace without the involvement of our primary selling or customer onboarding teams. Additionally, we have established relationships with certain business application providers that target small businesses that have purchased our functionality for use by their customers and embedded our solutions into their offering. We believe serving small businesses is important because it expands our footprint and establishes customer relationships that may become more valuable to us over time as these customers grow, and also provides a potential barrier to entry from competitors that may seek to build market share by targeting the small business segment.
 We reach each market segment, from emerging small business to enterprise, through channels and tactics that match their expectations for content, outreach, timeliness, and service level. This can require high touch service for some enterprise customers and a fully automated purchase path for the smallest companies. We hire and train both sales and marketing teams specialized for each segment.
 Partners 
 Expanding and maintaining our partner ecosystem has been an essential part of our growth. We strive to be true and recognized instruments of our partners’ success, constantly engaging, investing in, and supporting them to create mutually valuable relationships that best serve our mutual customers. We emulate our partners’ go-to-market strategies to ensure alignment with their business processes. These relationships, along with our pre-built integrations, form a powerful moat against our competitors. Our goal is to be tightly integrated into our partners’ offerings, facilitating fast, simple onboarding and an easy-to-use experience for our shared customers.
 Our partner ecosystem is comprised of technology partners, such as software developers and publishers, independent software vendors, ecommerce platforms, and marketplaces; systems integrators, including value-added resellers, services firms, and ecommerce companies; and accounting firms, including CPAs and bookkeepers. Partners have multiple ways in which to engage with Avalara. All partners can refer Avalara products and earn commissions. Many partners choose to become certified to implement Avalara solutions for their customers. Our technology partners integrate Avalara solutions into their applications and receive revenue share, and a subset of technology partners embed Avalara AvaTax into their platform as the default tax engine and offer their customers a bundled price.
 Our partners range from globally known enterprises to startups and entrepreneurs who recognize the opportunity to add value to their customer relationships by leveraging our solutions. We offer these partners access to dedicated Avalara teams that provide sales and marketing assistance, as well as training and technical resources.
 Research & Development and Tax Content Team 
 
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, security, and testing of the Avalara Compliance Cloud. We devote substantial resources to continuously improve and scale our platform, add innovative new features and functionalities, build technology to support new products and content types, and improve the user experience for our platform and solutions. 
 Our global content teams are responsible for building and maintaining our propriety database of tax and product content required to calculate transaction tax for our customers. Tax analysts rely on advanced technologies to acquire and maintain tax content, keeping existing content up to date with changes and using teams of researchers and tax experts to edit, validate, and apply the changes to our database. This large team monitors, tests, and updates our tax content to incorporate new and revised tax rates, rules, taxing jurisdiction boundaries, and exemption conditions.
 Intellectual Property 
 
We primarily rely upon a combination of confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property. Our trademarks and service marks include Avalara, the Avalara logo, AvaTax, the Avalara Compliance Cloud, “Tax compliance done right,” “The Power of Orange,” marks for our acquired businesses, and various marketing slogans. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our solutions or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary and may also attempt to develop similar technology independently. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate.

The software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Third parties may claim that our current or future solutions infringe their intellectual property rights. We have in the past and may in the future have to defend ourselves against claims of intellectual property infringement, which could be expensive for us and harm our business and financial condition even if such claims are unsuccessful.
 Government Regulation 
 
Our business is subject to a range of complex laws and regulations, mostly relating to our involvement in our customers’ financial transactions. To be successful, we must promote and monitor compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements.
 We perform critical business functions for our customers, including tax determination, returns preparation and filing, and tax remittance. The federal Bank Secrecy Act requires that financial institutions, of which money transmitters are a subset, register with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to monitor, identify, report and, where possible, avoid money laundering and criminal or terrorist financing by customers. Most U.S. states also have laws that apply to money transmitters, and impose various licensure, examination, and bonding requirements on them. We believe these federal and state laws and regulations were not intended to cover the business activity of remitting transaction taxes that taxpayers owe to the various states. However, if federal or state regulators were to apply these laws and regulations to this business activity, whether through expansion of enforcement activities, new interpretations of the scope of certain of these laws and regulations or of available exemptions, or otherwise, or if our activities were held by a court to be covered by such laws or regulations, we could be required to expend time, money, and other resources to deal with enforcement actions and any penalties that might be asserted, to institute and maintain a compliance program specific to money transmission laws, and possibly to change aspects of how we conduct business to achieve compliance or minimize regulation. We have contractually agreed with certain states collecting sales tax that in determining and remitting taxes on behalf of certain customers, we will comply with various technical, filing, privacy, confidentiality, bonding, and trust account requirements.
 In the course of selling products and services, retailers and other businesses often come into possession of credit card numbers and other personal information of consumers. Determining the transaction taxes owed by our customers involves providing our solutions with the types and prices of products they sell, as well as information regarding addresses that products are shipped from and delivered to. Our tax exemption certificate management solution also requires input of certain information regarding the purchasers who are entitled to tax exemptions. Our beverage alcohol business requires collection of personal information about certain individuals associated with each customer, as well as information regarding beverage alcohol product purchasers and recipients. Numerous local, regional, state, and national laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, and safeguarding of certain information that could be used to commit identity theft or fraud. Although most of the data that is provided to our solutions by our customers cannot be used to identify individual consumers, we may be subject to these laws in certain circumstances. Most states and many countries have also adopted data security breach laws that require notice to affected consumers of any security breach as to their personal information. In the event of a security breach, our compliance with these laws may subject us, depending on the personal information in question, to costs associated with notice and remediation, as well as potential investigations from federal regulatory agencies, state attorneys general, and other governmental authorities.
 Failures to safeguard data adequately or to destroy data securely could subject us to regulatory investigations or enforcement actions under federal or state data security, unfair practices, or consumer protection laws. The scope and interpretation of these laws, and the burdens and costs of complying with them, could increase in the future.
 Human Capital Management
 
We believe our corporate culture provides an advantage in recruiting new employees and retaining our best talent, as well as driving behaviors across our entire organization that help us succeed. This culture is characterized in the many employees who embody our nine success traits: optimism, passion, adaptability, humility, fun, ownership, curiosity, urgency, and simplicity. The rallying point of our culture is the color orange. Our employees wear this color with pride every day, and we have trademarked the slogan “The Power of Orange.” Our culture permeates our sales and marketing outreach, and the significance of the color orange has been featured in multiple news articles. As a result, we believe our customers, partners, and many prospects readily identify and appreciate our culture in their interactions with the Avalara team.

As of December 31, 2020, we had 3,351 full-time employees. Of these employees, 1,893 are based in the United States, 18 are based in Canada, 305 are in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, 968 are based in India, and 167 are based in Brazil. Our global workforce is highly educated, with most of our employees working in engineering, technical, or professional roles. With the exception of Brazil and certain countries in the E.U., where collective bargaining agreements are commonplace, none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
 We offer a competitive compensation package that is designed to attract new employees and retain, motivate, and reward current employees. Our compensation program includes base salaries, cash bonuses, and equity compensation for certain employees. In addition, we offer a range of benefits to our employees, including employee stock purchase plan for U.S. employees, retirement plans, medical, dental, and vision insurance, health and dependent care flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts, basic and voluntary life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, and disability insurance.
 Beginning in 2019, we engaged a leading polling and analytics firm to measure our employee engagement performance and have invested in company-wide initiatives to support our engagement goals. We are committed to continuous improvement through our investments in coaching, mentorship, training, and other initiatives designed to support our employees. These initiatives include an employee assistance program, commuter benefits, professional training and development platforms and opportunities, tuition reimbursement for eligible employees, employee resource groups, virtual events such as trivia contests and a global talent show, and free and subsidized exercise and mindfulness programs. 
 We have a number of employee resource groups that enhance our inclusive and diverse culture, including Women of Avalara, Veterans of Avalara, Prism (LGBTQ+), and Ujima (African American/Black). We continue to recruit technical talent in diverse communities, including by engaging as a sponsor of the annual Grace Hopper Celebration (the world’s largest gathering of women technologists) and AfroTech (a multicultural tech conference that brings leaders in technology and business together to exchange ideas and build a strong Black technology community). We require anti-harassment training as part of our new employee onboarding process and regularly for all employees, and we also conduct managing bias training for our leadership and executive teams.
 In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our workforce. Most of our employees have worked remotely since March 2020, and we anticipate that most of our employees will continue to work remotely for a significant portion of 2021. We have instituted safety protocols and procedures for the limited number of employees who continue to work on site. During the pandemic we launched an employee resource group for remote workers. We also conducted employee surveys to help us understand how the company is doing as an employer and identify employee concerns specifically in the context of handling COVID-19 requirements for our office locations and the impact of the pandemic on our employees.
