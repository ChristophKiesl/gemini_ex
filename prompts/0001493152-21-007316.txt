Future Plans
 
As at the date of this report, the number of COVID-19 cases have hit over 124 million worldwide with approximately 2.7 million lives lost. About 17% of those who contracted the disease are still battling on.
 
A year on, after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the threats brought about by the pandemic have not abated. There are two opposing developments on COVID-19, (i) the discovery of the COVID-19 vaccines which have went into commercial production, and first made available for patients on December 8, 2020. As at the date of this report more than 458 million doses of the vaccine have been administered across 87 countries; and (ii) The emergence of, possibly, more virulent mutant strains of the COVID-19.
 
In Malaysia, where our products are mainly sold, the number of COVID-19 cases have spiked. On January 12, 2021, the local government declared a state of emergency nationwide to combat COVID-19. Intermittent lockdowns were imposed in various states and districts. On March 5, 2020, lockdowns in most part of the country was eased to a Conditional Movement Control Order.
 
In view of the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Malaysian government had entered into several agreements to secure COVID-19 vaccines with several pharmaceutical companies. There were two agreements executed with Pfizer-BioNTech, each for the supply of 12.8 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines, the first one million doses will be delivered as early as the first quarter of 2021. Agreements were also signed with Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute and China’s Sinovac Biotech for an approximate 18.4 million doses.

February 2021 was a significant month for Malaysia as all frontline staff of the country, which comprised those in healthcare, police, the Volunteers Department of Malaysia, the Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia and civil defence sectors were vaccinated. On February 16, 2021, Prime Minister, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced that a National COVID-19 Immunisation Plan will be implemented for one year after February 2021, which 80% of the Malaysia population will be vaccinated to achieve herd immunization.
 
As with many other corporations, as far as the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have encountered challenges in terms of business and corporate developments. ASL, our newly acquired subsidiary that is principally involved in network marketing performed marginally better in the financial year ended 2020 as compared to the preceding year. As businesses continues to be digitized, we will further capitalize on the e-commerce trading platform provided by Vettons Sdn. Bhd. to perform e-marketing and e-trading of our products to members, as well as online e-recruitment of new members.
 
In September 2020, we have also incorporated WATP to pursue the business of promoting wellness and wellbeing lifestyle of the community by providing services that includes online editorials, programs, events and campaigns on how to achieve positive wellness and lifestyle. The establishment of WATP is a further expansion of our business into the health and wellness industry. While the COVID-19 pandemic subsists, we will concentrate our positive energy in developing our businesses in Malaysia where most of our activities are concentrated. We anticipate expanding into the Asian markets in the future, with a particular focus, at least initially, on expanding into Thailand, Indonesia and Taiwan. Our expansion plans constructed earlier, has to be delayed due to changes in rules and regulations imposed by the local governments of these countries, which at this moment are still subject to continuous reviews and changes, changes in work-methods and various other obstacles brought about as a direct result of the pandemic. We view these challenges positively as we will now, be able to develop new methods of operations that are more cost effective. Information technology will be deployed more extensively. We also plan to allocate funds to research new products to widen our products and services in our ATP Zeta Super Health Program, as well as the ÉNERGÉTIQUE and BEAUNIQUE series. However, such development will require intensive research, development and testing. We cannot accurately determine a definitive timeline at present, nor have we determined an appropriate budget, for these future activities. We may also evaluate potential acquisitions in the future which we feel may have synergy with our current operations.
 
When the pandemic has subsided or is over and restrictions on travelling between nations are uplifted, we will set up offices in the countries in which we operate to better service our customers for higher returns. It is the group’s ultimate aim to partake in all the lucrative areas of the health and wellness ecosystem as far as possible, to carve a niche in the health and wellness industry.
 
Marketing
 
Leveraging on information technology, we will continue to build our brand image to create brand awareness to penetrate the marketplace and attract customers. For the Company’s network marketing business, we have a corporate website which introduces and promotes our products and services, enable e-trading and e-recruitment of members. Going forward, we will use our corporate website more extensively to market all our products and services. We will utilize marketing related search engines to attract potential clients to our website. In financial year 2020, we have also synched-up with Vettons Sdn. Bhd, an e-merchant to further our reach through e-commerce. On February 1, 2021, Mr. How Kok Choong, the CEO and director of the Company, was appointed as the non-executive Chairman of Vettons Sdn Bhd.
 
Additionally, we will explore other online methods to enhance brand awareness that are impactful for community building for our other ventures in the health and wellness industry such as referral programs, develop contents for guest publishing, social media contests, etc. We will be social focus in the selection of social networks for our social media marketing, and where appropriate infographics will be used and influence marketing will be employed.

Competition
 
The health and wellness industry, with a focus on health supplements in particular in Malaysia, where we operate, is rather competitive. Our focus is on the mature group of customers, i.e. adults ranging in age from 18-65 years old. We face competition from various retail health supplement providers, pharmacies, and Multi-Level Marketing Companies which supply health supplement products, such as Bio-Life Marketing Sdn Bhd, Elken Group, Usana Group, BMS Organics, NHF Group and their respective affiliates. These competitors are generating significant traffic to their marketing websites; and have established brand recognition and financial resources.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our type of market include the quality of health supplements, the efficacies of the health supplements, strength and depth of relationships with clients, the ability to identify the changing needs and requirements of prospective clients, and the scope of services. Through utilizing our competitive strengths, we believe that we have a competitive edge over other competitors due to the breadth of our product offerings, one stop convenience, pricing, our services, our reputation and product safety. We are confident we can develop and enlarge our market share in the Malaysian market and potentially further into the overseas market.
 
For all our ventures in the health and wellness industry, present and future, we will plan our inroads to ward off unnecessary competition.
 
Customers
 
Our customer base increased to 128,136 members as at December 31, 2020, solely brought about by the acquisition of ASL, which brought us to a large group of customers in an established network marketing sales channel that were established in Malaysia for the past 15 years.
