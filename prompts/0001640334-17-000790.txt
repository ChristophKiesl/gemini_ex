Corporate Overview
 
Our company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 15, 2011. Our business objectives are to produce and market our own brand of ice wine made from grapes harvested in Armenia, a ice wine to China and Russia. We seek to significantly expand the production of our icewine, which we believe is the first ice wine produced in Armenia or its neighboring regions. 
 
Our offices are currently located at 1805-141 Lyon Court, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M6B 3H2. Our telephone number is (647) 640-3625. We have a website at www.armeaubrands.com.
 
Activities to Date
 
In the summer of 2011, our company sought proposals from various icewine experts in Canada with the objective of producing icewine in Armenia.
 
On August 2, 2011, we accepted an icewine consultation proposal from Mr. Tilman Hainle of IMBIBEdesign. Mr. Hainle, along with his father, had produced the first icewine in Canada in 1978. Pursuant to this proposal, IMBIBEdesign outlined the scope of work, schedule, deliverables, and terms of agreement for the icewine design and production process in Armenia. Fees due to IMBIBEdesign under this proposal were approximately $9,700 which was initially estimated at $8,000 and comprised of billings at an hourly rate of $135/hour.
 
In September 2011, Mr. Hainle accompanied our company to Armenia. In Armenia, we contracted Mr. Gagik Melyan, the deputy director of the Scientific Centre of Viticulture for Armenia, Fruit-Growing and Wine-Making, to accompany our team to various grape growing regions in Armenia and to provide us with his scientific and expert guidance and supervision of vineyard activities in Armenia for the 2012 season. The Scientific Centre of Viticulture for Armenia was founded in 1927 and is a research institute engaged in plant breeding since its inception, and in plant biotechnology since 1990. Activities concern grapes and other fruits. 60% of its budget is directed to germplasm enhancement. The 40% remaining is equally shared between line development and line evaluation.

On October 11, 2011, we entered into a contractor agreement with Mr. Melyan where we would compensate him $500 per month in exchange for his expertise. With the help of our experts, our company identified a village near the town of Areni in the province of Vayots Dzor that had the right climatic and soil conditions for Icewine production. Two indigenous Armenian grapes, one red and one white, were chosen to create our first vintage.
 
Our company then began negotiations with various local wine companies in Armenia, On October 11, 2011, our company and EDVAG Group entered into a wine services agreement (the “Wine Services Agreement”) whereas EDVAG Group agreed to provide wine-making services to produce a Canadian-style icewine under the tutelage of Mr. Hainle.
 
Under this agreement, EDVAG shall manage and realize the entire winemaking process under the guidance and direction of our company and our technical contractor(s).
 
We will also reimburse EDVAG for the following items procured for or on behalf of Armeau in the winemaking process at landed cost plus taxes. This Agreement will continue in force for a minimum period of 10 years. EDVAG is a wholly managed winemaking company duly registered in Armenia and operating in the CIS and international markets.
 
On October 15, 2011, 7000 m2 (0.7 hectares) of vineyard was reserved in a village in the province of Vayots Dzor Armenia. To reserve the vineyard, the vineyard owner was paid in advance on an estimated yield. EDVAG paid this advance on our behalf and we paid EDVAG back with an extra 10% service fee as per our agreement. On January 23, 2012, six tons of white (Voskehat) and three tons of red (Areni) were harvested at a temperature of -10°C (14°F).
 
On February 6, 2012, we accepted a proposal by IMBIBEdesign to travel to Armenia again, this time to oversee the fermentation of our icewine. Pursuant to this proposal, IMBIBEdesign outlined the scope of work, schedule, deliverables, and terms of agreement for the icewine winemaking in Armenia. Fees due to IMBIBEdesign under this proposal were approximately $5,200 which included a lump sum of $3,600 and additional services, such as change in the scope of work by us that was billed at an hourly billing rate of $135/hour.
 
1250 litres of icewine were produced. The icewine produced consisted of 950 litres of white icewine (Voskehat grape) and 300 litres of red icewine (Areni grape). The red icewine was ultimately judged of insufficient quality and rejected. Due to technical problems, the bottling of the white icewine was delayed until December 2015 when the wine was deemed ready to drink. 4,500 bottles of white icewine were bottled and 200 bottles were sent to Canada in December 2015 for sampling and evaluation. We are using the remaining 4,300 bottles for tasting and sampling by potential customers and distributors.
 
On February 1, 2016, we entered into a distribution agreement with Alpha Food Services. Pursuant to this agreement, we agreed to grant to Alpha Food Services, for a term of three years, the exclusive right to sell and distribute our icewine products in Armenia, Russia, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The agreement does not apply to our first vintage, which is being used for sample and marketing purposes. 
 
The purchase price of icewine to Alpha Food includes delivery to Alpha Food’s warehouse. The delivery cost component of the purchase price shall be mutually negotiated and adjusted between the parties from time to time in response to account for any changes to the delivery requirements. Our company and Alpha Food shall negotiate any price increases for any icewine products at least 60 days prior to the effective date of any such increase. Alpha Food shall have the right to order one month of supply of the icewine products at the current price prior to any increase.
 
Our company and Alpha Food shall agree on our price to Alpha Food and Alpha Food’s price to its customers. All parties shall agree on an annual basis, or more frequently if required, as to the prices at which Alpha Food shall sell the icewine products to its customers.
 
In the event that our company and Alpha Food cannot agree on either price within 30 days of commencement of the negotiations, the prices then in effect for each of said prices will be increased by an amount equal to the change in the Consumer Price Index-All US over a period of months equal to the number of months since the last price increase for each price. This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect for a period of three years.

Our Recent Business 
 
During fiscal 2016, we were unable to raise the necessary funds to achieve our objectives of buying and equipping a wine-making facility in Armeia. We did not earn any revenues from March 15, 2011 (date of inception) to January 31, 2017. However, we did produce 4,500 bottles of icewine which will be used for product sampling and marketing to potential customers and distributors. We intend to apply any proceeds from the sale of our current icewine reserves toward the production of a second vintage. We have not commenced the marketing stage of our business, other than the review of data and online research, the development of a logo and label, selection of a bottle, mini-product brochure and the development of a website www.armeaubrands.com, and can provide no assurance that we will generate revenue from the proposed sale of our beverages.
Competition and Market Position
 
Canada is the world’s largest manufacturer of icewine and makes much more than all the other countries put together. In 2014, Canada produced 2.5 million bottles worth on average approximately $70 million retail. People relate to Canada as a top icewine producer due to the well-known cold Canadian winters. Canada’s top international awards are dominated by icewine.
 
While Germany and Austria also makes icewine, their winters are not cold enough to consistently produce icewine every year.
 
Counterfeit icewines made by cryoextraction (the process by which grapes are frozen with refrigeration and pressed) have become prominent items in retail stores across Asia bearing false labels. These “freezer wines” lack the intensity and complexity of authentic icewines. Freezer-frozen grapes will usually not have hung on the vines as long, undergoing the physical and chemical changes that give authentic icewines their unique aromas and flavors. Even more of a problem are artificially sweetened icewines. Some estimate that as much as 50% of icewines sold in China are fake.
 
Icewine has proven particularly popular in Asia Pacific and Southeast Asian markets in recent years, as the fascination with icewine’s unique production (i.e. handpicked frozen grapes during winter months) is widespread among these regions’ consumers. In fact, icewine is a “sought after/exclusive” product and is often purchased when visiting Canada as gifts or investments. The growth of Canadian Icewine in Asian markets is realized firsthand in export data; approximately 74% of Canadian icewine is exported to Asian markets. Furthermore, seven of the top ten Canadian icewine export destinations are Asian countries, signifying the popularity of the dessert wine in this region.
 
In 2014, the Canadian Vintners Association (“CVA”) stated that icewine export value was $19.4 million and volume 228,500 litres. Furthermore, the CVA stated that China is the number one export market for Canada, with over $8 million of icewine (103,566 L) exported in 2014. The top 10 icewine export markets in 2014 were China, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, United States, United Kingdom, Malaysia and France, representing 96.8% of icewine export sales volume. 
 
Chinese consumers are attracted to the taste profile of the concentrated, rich icewine. They are impressed with the international awards and the prestige that accompanies icewine and they have a much stronger gifting culture.
 
Rising incomes, especially in urban areas, have led to greater demand for high quality prestige products that can demonstrate wealth and convey status. In urban areas, there is also greater receptiveness to new types of alcoholic beverages, niche products and imported drinks like icewine.
 
Russia being a trade partner to Armenia is also a major potential market for our company. Canadian icewine has not yet made inroads in Russia. However, sweet wines do dominate this market. Russians, like the Chinese, generally have a sweeter taste preference for wines than in the Western world. Also the taste for premium, and prestigious material possession and status remain important to Russians. We believe icewine has the potential to capture these trends.

Suppliers
 
We signed a formal, long-term agreement with EDVAG Group to produce our icewine in Armenia. The contract is based on an à la carte pricing menu whereas we can purchase services as needed. Our intellectual property rights, which include our trade secrets in icewine making, are protected in the agreement.
Distribution Methods
 
Our winemaker, EDVAG Group, provides warehousing and distribution services from their location in Yerevan, Armenia. They will bill us on a monthly basis for these services.
Intellectual Property
 
Previously, we were granted an Armenian trademark registration for “Armeau”. In 2012, we started the process of a US trademark. Unfortunately, after spending a considerable amount of money on legal services, the trademark registration lapsed due to our inability to demonstrate use of the trademark, which is a requirement in registering a trademark, because of our delays in production of our icewine. Once we have the funds and are in a position to register our trademark, we will begin the process again.
Government Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations in areas such as food and beverage, alcohol, consumer protection, government contracts, trade, environmental protection, labor and employment, tax, licensing and others. For example, in the Canada and U.S., most federal and local governments have alcohol laws and regulations directed specifically toward our industry, including even environmental laws. In certain jurisdictions, we will have to obtain licenses or permits in order to comply with standards governing environmental regulations and the sale of alcoholic beverages.
 
The alcoholic beverage industry is also subject to requirements, codes and standards imposed by various insurance, approval and listing and standards organizations. Depending upon the type of alcoholic beverage and requirements of the applicable local governmental jurisdiction, adherence to the requirements, codes and standards of such organizations is mandatory in some instances and voluntary in others.
 
We do not believe that compliance with government regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. Given the alcohol related content that will be available on our website, we will implement appropriate safeguards and electronic warnings to ensure that visitors to our site are aware of any age related restrictions that may be applicable to them while visiting our site and are abiding by applicable laws regarding alcohol (such as age verification and ensure that all applicable duties and taxes are paid). Furthermore, our distributors will be contractors who are experienced in alcoholic beverage distribution and product sold over the internet can be verified by either credit card information and limited by internet proxy information.
 
The effects of material regulations on wine businesses are:
 


1. | Limitations of sales to specific jurisdictions/geographic areas; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Limitation of sales to specific consumers; 
3. | Compliance of food and beverage qualitative standards and measures; 
4. | Increased cost due to compliance with duties, permitting and regulation; and 
5. | Compliance and limitation of means of marketing sales and advertising of products.
