ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is newly incorporated blank check company incorporated as a British Virgin Island (“BVI”) business company on February 23, 2021. The Company was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”).
On June 14, 2021, the Company consummated the IPO of 5,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share (“Ordinary Share”) and one right (“Right”) to receive one-tenth of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 750,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments which the underwriters exercised in full simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 5,750,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in a total gross proceeds of $57,500,000.
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (the “Private Placement”) with BSG First Euro Investment Corp., (the “Sponsor”), of 292,500 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,925,000. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. Such initial purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
A total of $58,075,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders at JPMorgan Chase Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the Trust Account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination and (ii) the Company’s failure to consummate a business combination by December 14, 2023 (if extended to the full extent permitted).
At December 31, 2022, the Company had $18,237,834 held in the Trust Account, which primarily consists of investments in mutual funds that invest in U.S. government securities, cash, or a combination thereof.
Merger Agreement
On November 18, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Original Merger Agreement”) dated November 18, 2021 with Blue Safari Mini Corp., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Bitdeer Technologies Holding Company, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“Bitdeer”).
On December 15, 2021, parties to the Original Merger Agreement entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with (ii) Bitdeer Technologies Group, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“BTG”), (iii) Blue Safari Merge Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (“Merger Sub 1”), (iv) Blue Safari Merge II Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (“Merger Sub 2”), and (v) Bitdeer Merge Limited, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (“Merger Sub 3”, and together with BTG, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, the “Acquisition Entities”) to effect a change in structure of the business combination without affecting any underlying economic interests, whereby (a) Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into the Company with the Company being the surviving entity (the “First SPAC Merger”) and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of BTG, (b) immediately following the First SPAC Merger, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub 2 with Merger Sub 2 being the surviving entity (the “Second SPAC Merger”, and together with the First SPAC Merger, the “Initial Mergers”), and (c) following the Initial Mergers, Merger Sub 3 will merge with and into Bitdeer (the “Acquisition Merger” and together with the Initial Mergers, the “Mergers”), with Bitdeer being the surviving entity

and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of BTG. The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein were unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each of the Company, BTG, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3, Merger Sub and Bitdeer.
The Mergers and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Business Combination”) are expected to be consummated after obtaining the requisite shareholders’ approval of the Company, BTG, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3, Merger Sub and Bitdeer and the satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions. For more information, see the Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 15, 2021.
On May 30, 2022, parties entered into a First Amendment to the Merger Agreement (the “Amendment”, and the Merger Agreement as amended by such Amendment, the “Amended Merger Agreement”) to extend the termination date upon which either we or Bitdeer may terminate the Amended Merger Agreement, from May 31, 2022 to September 1, 2022.
In addition, pursuant to the First Amendment, Bitdeer will provide the Company interest-free loans with an aggregate principal amount of US$1,993,000 to fund any amount that may be required in order to extend the period of time available for us to consummate a business combination in accordance with our organizational documents (the “Combination Period”) and for our working capital. Such loans will only become repayable upon the Closing of the Business Combination. 
On December 2, 2022, the parties entered into a Second Amendment to Merger Agreement (the “Second Amendment”, and the Amended Merger Agreement as amended by such Second Amendment, the “Second Amended Merger Agreement”) to extend the termination date upon which either the Company or Bitdeer may terminate the Second Amended Merger Agreement, from September 1, 2022 to the earlier of (i) June 1, 2023 and (ii) the then last day of the Combination Period. In addition, pursuant to the Second Amendment, Bitdeer has agreed to provide the Company an additional interest-free loans with an aggregate principal amount of $2,584,141 to fund any amount that may be required in order to further extend the Combination Period and for the Company’s working capital. Such loans will only become repayable upon the Acquisition Closing (as defined in the Second Amended Merger Agreement). As of December 31, 2022, the Company received such interest-free loan from Bitdeer in the aggregate principal amount of $2,545,800.
Merger Consideration
In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the effective time of the First SPAC Merger, each outstanding units of the Company shall automatically be detached and the holder thereof shall be deemed to hold such number of Class A ordinary shares and rights of the Company in accordance with the terms of the applicable units. In addition, upon the effective time of the First SPAC Merger, (i) each issued and outstanding ordinary share in the Company will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive one class A ordinary share in BTG (“BTG Class A Ordinary Share”), which will trade in the United States in the form of American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”), and (ii) each SPAC Right will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a BTG Class A Ordinary Share in the same manner as SPAC Ordinary Share as set forth in subclause (iii) with fractional shares to be either rounded down to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of British Virgin Islands law.
Upon the effective time of the Acquisition Merger, (i) each issued and outstanding ordinary share and preferred share in Bitdeer will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive such number of BTG Class A Ordinary Share equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement), which will trade in the United States in the form of ADSs, provided that each issued and outstanding Key Executive Share (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive such number of Class V Ordinary Shares in BTG equal to the Exchange Ratio; (ii) each issued and outstanding Company restricted share unit will be converted into an award of restricted share units, representing the rights to receive BTG Class A Ordinary Share under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan of BTG, each subject to substantially the same terms, as adjusted for the Exchange Ratio; (iii) the outstanding Company Convertible Note (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will be assumed by BTG and represent the rights to receive BTG Class A Ordinary Share, subject to the same terms and conditions, as adjusted for the Exchange Ratio; and (iv) each Dissenting Share (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will represent only the right to receive the applicable payments set forth in the Merger Agreement.

In connection with the business combination, we have filed certain relevant materials with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Promptly after filing our definitive proxy statement with the SEC, we will mail the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each shareholder entitled to vote at the extraordinary general meeting relating to the business combination. INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF THE COMPANY ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE BUSINESS COMBINATION THAT THE COMPANY WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY, BITDEER AND THE MERGERS. The preliminary proxy statement and the definitive proxy statement, when filed, and other relevant materials in connection with the acquisition (when they become available), and any other documents filed by us with the SEC, may be obtained free of charge at the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov).
Extensions and Redemptions
On December 5, 2022, the Company held an Extraordinary General Meeting. At this meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved the proposal to amend and restate (the “Charter Amendment”) the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the “Charter”) to, among other things, extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination (the “Extension”) up to four (4) times for an additional three months each time from December 14, 2022 to December 14, 2023 (“Extended Termination Date”) (the “Amended Charter”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Charter, the Company has until 18 months from the closing of the IPO to consummate a Business Combination, provided however that the Company may, by resolution of directors, at the request of the initial shareholders, extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to four times, each time by an additional three months (for a total of up to 30 months to complete a Business Combination), subject to the initial shareholders depositing additional funds into the Trust Account for each three-month extension in accordance with terms as set out in the Trust Agreement. In the event that the Company does not consummate a Business Combination within up to 30 months from the closing of the IPO (subject to valid three months extensions having been made in each case), such failure shall trigger an automatic redemption of the Public Shares (an Automatic Redemption Event) and the Directors of the Company shall take all such action necessary (i) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten (10) Business Days thereafter to redeem the Public Shares in cash at a per-share amount equal to the applicable Per-Share Redemption Price; and (ii) as promptly as practicable, to cease all operations except for the purpose of making such distribution and any subsequent winding up of the Company’s affairs. In the event of an Automatic Redemption Event, only the holders of Public Shares shall be entitled to receive pro rata redeeming distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Public Shares. 
In connection with the vote to approve the Charter Amendment, the Company paid approximately $41.99 million out of the Trust Account to redeem 4,031,612 Class A ordinary shares at a redemption price of approximately $10.41 per share.
On June 1, 2022 and September 6, 2022, using the loan amount received to date, the Company deposited into the Company’s Trust Account $1,150,000 (representing $0.20 per Class A ordinary share) to extend the Combination Period from June 14, 2022 to December 14, 2022. On December 5, 2022, the Company made a deposit of $257,758.20 (representing $0.15 per Class A ordinary share) to the Trust Account and extended the Combination Period from December 14, 2022 to March 14, 2023.
Competitive Strengths
If the transaction with Bitdeer does not close, we believe that our management team is well positioned to identify and implement other attractive business combination opportunities in an efficient manner. Through our management team’s network, we intend to execute a business combination and ultimately create returns for our shareholders through organic growth and/or follow-on acquisitions. Our management team is led by Alex Yamashita.
We believe the experience and contacts of our management team will give us distinct advantages in sourcing, structuring and consummating acquisition transactions. Mr. Alan Yamashita, our Chairman, has over 40 years of experience in the financial and equity investment industry having most recently been a managing partner at Polar Ventures, a private investment firm that provides capital and strategic solutions to companies in sectors important to the Asia region’s development. Mr. Alan Yamashita was previously executive advisor to Mizuho Alternative Investments LLC, president and chief executive officer of Search Investment Group, and founding chief executive officer and chief investment officer of Search Alternative Investment Limited, a major private global hedge fund and private equity investment practice with a multi-billion dollar portfolio.

Officer, has over a decade of experience in investment, and entrepreneurship ranging from fintech and big data. Mr. Naphat Sirimongkolkasem, our Chief Financial Officer and Director, is the co-founder of Collis Capital and has valuable experience in management, business development and corporate finance transactions in Hong Kong and the PRC. Mr. Mark Streeter, our Independent Director is a Director of Cultur3 Capital, an Approved Investment Manager, and has over a decade of experience in institutional capital markets and consulting in fintech and blockchain sectors. Mr. Joseph Chow, our Independent Director, has over two decades of experience in investment and legal practice, and has advised on a series of mergers and acquisitions, commercial transactions and intellectual property rights protection.

He co-authored and lead a report on fintech and entrepreneurship, which was presented at the European Commission in 2013. Our management team’s past performance is not an assurance that we will be able to identify an appropriate candidate for our initial business combination or achieve success with respect to the business combination we intend to consummate. However, we believe that the skills and professional network of our management team will enable us to identify, structure and consummate a business combination.

However, we believe that the skills and professional network of our management team will enable us to identify, structure and consummate a business combination.
Effecting an Acquisition Transaction
If the transaction with Bitdeer does not close, our acquisition strategy will be to capitalize on the strengths of our management team to allow us to identify businesses that have the capacity for cash flow creation, opportunity for operational improvement, robust company fundamentals, and qualified and driven management teams. Our deal sourcing process will leverage our management team’s industry experiences proven deal sourcing capabilities and broad network of relationships in numerous industries, including business executives, entrepreneurs, media relationships, institutional investors, family offices, investment bankers and attorneys. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest noncore assets or divisions. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or independent investment banking firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
The COVID-19 coronavirus has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide, and potential target companies may defer or end discussions for a potential business combination with us whether or not COVID-19 affects their business operations. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. We may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limiting our ability to conduct meetings to negotiate and consummate transactions in a timely manner with potential investors, target company’s personnel, or vendors and services providers.

Shareholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination
Although we may seek shareholder approval before we effect our initial business combination, we may not do so for business or legal reasons (so long as such transaction does not require shareholder approval under the BVI Business Companies Act or the rules of Nasdaq). Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether we expect shareholder approval would be required under the BVI Business Companies Act for each such transaction.
​

Type of Transaction | | WhetherShareholderApproval isRequired | 
Purchase of assets | ​ | No | ​
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | ​ | No | ​
Merger of target with a subsidiary of the company | ​ | No | ​
Merger of the company with a target | ​ | Yes | ​
Entering into contractual agreements with a target to obtain control | ​ | No | ​

​
Additionally, under Nasdaq’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:

● | we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We also may be required to obtain shareholder approval if we wish to take certain actions in connection with our initial business combination such as amending our memorandum and articles of association. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing of our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules.
Redemption rights for public shareholders upon consummation of our initial business combination
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion their shares upon the consummation of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their right to receive liquidating distributions if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the Combination Period. However, if our initial shareholders or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the Combination Period.
Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination
Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Charter, the Company has until 18 months from the closing of the IPO to consummate a Business Combination, provided however that the Company may, by resolution of directors, at the request of the initial shareholders, extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to four times, each time by an additional three months (for a total of up to 30 months to complete a Business Combination), subject to the initial shareholders depositing additional funds into the Trust Account for each three-month extension in accordance with terms as set out in the Trust Agreement. In the event that the Company does not consummate a Business Combination within up to 30 months from the closing of the IPO (subject to valid three months extensions having been made in each case), such failure shall trigger an automatic redemption of the Public Shares (an Automatic Redemption Event) and the Directors of the Company shall take all such action necessary (i) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than 

5



ten (10) Business Days thereafter to redeem the Public Shares in cash at a per-share amount equal to the applicable Per-Share Redemption Price; and (ii) as promptly as practicable, to cease all operations except for the purpose of making such distribution and any subsequent winding up of the Company’s affairs. In the event of an Automatic Redemption Event, only the holders of Public Shares shall be entitled to receive pro rata redeeming distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Public Shares.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting an alternate target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:

● | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a transaction;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the fact that there are fewer than ten months left in the Combination Period;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert public shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nasdaq may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding Rights and unit purchase options and the potential future dilution they represent;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions to Maxim Group LLC upon consummation of our initial business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private units (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
Employees
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
