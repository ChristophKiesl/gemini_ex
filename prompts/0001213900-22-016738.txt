Item 1. Business.
General



We are a blank check company formed on August 6, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination. We have generated no revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues at the earliest until we consummate our initial business combination. We completed our initial public offering in December 2021, and since that time, we have engaged in discussions with potential business combination target companies; we have not, however, as of yet, reached a definitive agreement with a specific target company with respect to an initial business combination with us.



While we may pursue a business combination target in any business or industry and across any geographical region, we are focusing our search on mobility-related technology businesses.



Industry Opportunity



Mobility is getting increasingly intelligent — cars, cities, roads etc. — all have started to increasingly deploy technology and data in order to achieve better products, services and utilization.



These trends are propelling tectonic shifts and the formation of new and exciting trends in the industry, including flexible insurance models for vehicles, new types of vehicle manufacturers, sensor technology that mimics and surpasses human capabilities, and much more. Automotive tech start-ups have catapulted onto the US stock markets through SPACs, amassing a market capitalization approaching $60 billion.



Members of our team are heavily immersed in the vibrant mobility sector both as investors and technological business entrepreneurs. We are uniquely positioned to learn about the “next big thing” with our experience in guiding companies from their inception through the chasm to market acceptance.



According to McKinsey, since 2010, investors have poured nearly $330 billion into more than 2,000 companies focused on mobility — specifically connectivity, automation, smart mobility and electrification (CASE) — with over $80 billion of this amount invested since the beginning of 2019 alone. About two-thirds of the total investment, or $206 billion, went to autonomous-vehicle (AV) technologies and smart mobility. A smaller amount — about $123 billion — went to connectivity and electric vehicles (EVs), suggesting that companies prefer to develop these technologies in-house, rather than by pursuing inorganic growth.



McKinsey further reports that non-incumbents have made over 90% of investments in future-mobility companies since 2010, with 65% coming from venture-capital and private-equity (VC/PE) companies and 28% from tech players. Traditional automotive companies only accounted for 7%, or roughly $20 billion to $25 billion, of the total amount invested.

Acquisition Strategy and Criteria



Our acquisition strategy is to identify an untapped opportunity within our target mobility industry and offer a public-ready business, a facility through which to enter the public sphere, access capital markets, and advance its priorities.



We are focusing on mid-size mobility companies that have a solid technological foundation and promising market opportunities which have so far refrained from becoming public for a variety of reasons. We hope to serve as an attractive partner for those companies, enabling them to go public in an alternate, more easily accessible manner — a business combination transaction — and to thereby benefit from the capital-raising options available for a publicly traded company in the U.S.



Our sponsor’s participants and their affiliates have extensive experience and expertise in strategic investments in public and private companies where they have a strong investment conviction driven by clearly identifiable growth opportunities. We apply a similar investment philosophy and approach to analyze prospective targets and identify an attractive business combination.



The experience and networks of the members of our team is the key element in our acquisition strategy. We believe that we can provide target companies with significant added value. This may represent a decisive competitive advantage when compared to other SPACs.



The team members have formidable knowledge of the mobility industry. We all have developed, built and are actively involved in companies building solutions for the automotive and mobility sectors. We recognize that often company founders who conceive and develop outstanding technologies do not have the necessary market knowledge and business experience to build a strong team and successfully convert their technology into commercial products. We believe we can provide that or help founders achieve it.



Our team has the ability to evaluate businesses comprehensively – 360 degrees, including technology, IP, competition and management — in order to assess whether the subject has the potential to be a truly good business.



Equally important is the team’s well developed positioning in the mobility sector. With the team spread across North America, Europe and the Middle East (Israel), team members are already familiar with a substantial percentage of the likely acquisition targets that are a part of the evaluation process.



We are confident of our ability to bring significant added value to acquisition targets, including:




● | Giving them access to our networks. We have well established contacts at senior level with executives in automotive and other relevant sectors. These could be used to open doors and facilitate business development opportunities, receive feedback on the attractiveness and potential of the products and so on.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Generally advising and participating in management discussions, giving the benefit of our experience and technological knowledge.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Considering and implementing corporate finance activities, including identifying and executing merger opportunities between companies in the mobility sector with strong synergies where the pooling of resources could well bring about economies of scale and significant increases in enterprise value.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






5







It must be emphasized that we take a highly proactive approach. The selection is made following an in depth process that comprises the following:




a) | Utilizing mobility industry expertise to identify about 100 potential targets.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b) | Carry out detailed evaluation in order to create a short list of between six and 12 potential targets.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c) | Monitor the six to 12 selected companies for up to four months, in order to assess their activities under regular operating conditions.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


d) | Initiate contact with management and start the due diligence process. The due diligence includes close involvement in the target company including participation in management meetings, attending meetings with customers, suppliers and other relevant parties.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


e) | Negotiate and execute acquisition.
---+-----------------------------------


f) | Post-acquisition monitoring and possible active participation in company management as appropriate.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We have identified the following general, non-exclusive criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective targets for our initial business combination. We have been using these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet one or more of these criteria and guidelines.



Essentially we seek good companies, with strong growth potential, having a management team that demonstrates openness to accept advice and to reassess objectives in light of changing market circumstances.



We intend to focus on target businesses or assets with the following attributes:




● | Large Markets. We target companies that operate or will operate in a large addressable market in the mobility sector and related technologies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Middle-Market Businesses. We believe that the middle-market segment provides the greatest number of opportunities for investment and is consistent with our sponsor’s participants’ investment history across the various mobility segments. These segments are where our management team has the strongest capability to identify attractive opportunities. We are seeking to acquire potential target businesses that can use the funding we bring to achieve value-creating milestones. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Established Platform at Inflection Point of Growth. Collectively, our management team and board has meaningful experience operating and investing in a broad range of businesses participating in future mobility. We believe that our broad understanding of companies operating in the mobility ecosystem, including connected, autonomous, shared and electric focused mobility businesses, uniquely positions us to identify companies at the center of mobility trends and identify opportunities where capital deployment can be most impactful. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefit from Being a Public Company. We are seeking potential target businesses with technological or other competitive advantages in the markets in which they operate that can benefit from a broader access to capital, and the heightened public profile associated with being a publicly traded company. It is likely that companies will have been planning a public issue as its preferred medium-long term financing strategy. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Technology-Driven Business Model. We are seeking to acquire potential target businesses with pioneering technologies in the mobility sector, where we are able to utilize our industry knowledge and contacts to validate the value proposition and provide added value. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitive Edge. We are targeting companies that are set up for long term growth and as such, have a competitive edge. This may include first to market, network effects, lead in technology or access to the key customers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Experienced Management Team. A target company’s management team and engineering/technical teams is a key part of our evaluation. The right combination of management and technical expertise at a target company is the key to long term success for these types of companies. Our management team and our board have significant experience in understanding such companies and evaluating a company’s management and technical expertise. The team must be suitable as a candidate for a public listing. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Significant Growth Prospects. We are looking to select a target business expected to have significant embedded and/or underexploited growth opportunities; with near- and longer-term valuation inflection points that will allow them to reap the advantages and acceleration of having access to public capital markets. It is important to see that the availability of investment will accelerate the growth path. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may use other criteria and guidelines as well. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, and criteria that our management may deem relevant. If we decide to enter an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that fact in our shareholder communications related to the acquisition. As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, this would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.



In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct a comprehensive due diligence review. That due diligence review may include, among other things, financial statement analysis, initial public offering readiness assessment, business practices integration analysis, document reviews, meetings with the target’s management and other employees, inspection of facilities, consultations with relevant industry experts, competitors, customers, and suppliers, as well as a review of additional information (operational, financial, legal and otherwise) that we obtain as part of our analysis of a target company.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.



Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets



We believe that the operational and transactional experience of our management team and members of our sponsor (and the investors in the sponsor) and the relationships they have developed because of such experience, provides us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets.



As stated earlier, we believe that members of our team have extensive knowledge of a substantial percentage of potential target companies in the ecosystem.



Members of our management team and other members of our sponsor have operated and invested in leading mobility companies, across their corporate life cycles and have developed deep relationships with organizations and investors operating around the world, and in target regions with a high concentration of mobility companies, in particular.



This network has grown through sourcing, acquiring, and financing businesses and maintaining relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams. Our management team members have significant experience in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. We believe that these networks of contacts and relationships and this experience will help us to identify attractive mobility technology-based businesses that can benefit from access to the public markets, and execute complex business combination transactions, thereby enhancing shareholder value. In addition, target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest noncore assets or divisions.



We believe that we are well-positioned to leverage our sponsor’s, affiliates’, and management team’s successful track record growing local and international technology companies into large, successful publicly traded entities, and their deep network of relationships, as strong competitive advantages. We utilize our management’s and sponsor’s expertise and their respective deal-sourcing capabilities to provide us with a strong pipeline of potential targets.

We believe that the experience of our management team and directors in evaluating assets through investing and company building enables us to source the highest quality targets. Our selection process leverages the relationships of our management team with industry captains, leading venture capitalists, private equity and hedge fund managers, respected peers, and a network of investment banking executives, attorneys, and accountants. Together with this network of trusted partners, we can capitalize the target business and create purposeful strategic initiatives to achieve attractive growth and performance targets.



Our management team consists of professionals and senior operating executives of various companies and entities with decades of experience and industry exposure across numerous mobility sectors. Based on our management team’s extensive experience and industry exposure, we believe that we may be able to identify, evaluate the risk and reward of, and execute on attractive acquisition opportunities.



Our management team consists of Rani Plaut, our Chief Executive Officer and director, Nir Sasson, our Chief Operating Officer, and Shai Kronfeld, our Chief Financial Officer and VP Business.



Significant Activities Since Inception



On December 20, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering. Pursuant to our IPO, we offered and sold an aggregate of 20,000,000 units, consisting of 17,500,000 units that served as the base offering amount, and an additional 2,500,000 units for which the underwriters exercised an over-allotment option (out of a total of 2,625,000 units for which the underwriters were granted an over-allotment option for 45 days following the pricing of the IPO).



Each unit consisted of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share and one-half of a redeemable warrant of the Company. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to us of $200,000,000.



Substantially concurrent with the closing of our IPO, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 945,715 private units to Spree Operandi U.S. LP, the wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary of the Company’s sponsor, Spree Operandi, LP. The purchase price per private unit was $10.00, generating aggregate gross proceeds to us of $9,457,150. The warrants contained in the private units are identical to the warrants included in the units sold in the initial public offering, except that, for so long as they are held by Spree Operandi, LP or its affiliates: (1) they are not redeemable by the Company; (2) they may not (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of those warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the Spree Operandi, LP until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination; and (3) they (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants) are entitled to registration rights.



Following the closings, a total of $204,000,000 from the proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private units was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.



Our units commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange on December 20, 2021 under the symbol “SHAPU”. As of February 4, 2022, holders of the units sold in the Company’s initial public offering may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares and warrants included in the units. The Class A ordinary shares and warrants that are separated are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols “SHAP” and “SHAP/W,” respectively. Units that are not separated continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “SHAP/U.”

Competitive Strengths



Status as a Public Company



We believe that our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to a traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination.



In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock or other equity interests in the target business for our ordinary shares or for a combination of our ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration used in the transaction to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe that target businesses might find this avenue a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than a typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.



Furthermore, once the business combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become a public company, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests than it would have as a privately-held company. Public company status can offer further benefits by enhancing a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and attracting talented employees.



While we believe that our status as a public company makes us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a business combination with a more established entity or with a private company. These limitations include constraints on our available financial resources, which may be inferior to those of other entities pursuing the acquisition of similar target businesses; the requirement that we seek shareholder approval of a business combination or conduct a tender offer in relation thereto, which may delay the consummation of a transaction; and the existence of our outstanding warrants, which may represent a source of future dilution.



Financial Position



With funds available in our trust fund in an amount of $204,000,000 assuming no redemptions and after payment of a $9,000,000 deferred underwriting fee to Stifel in connection with the business combination in each case before additional fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that allows us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, given the possibility that there may be a significant percentage of our public shareholders that may elect to redeem their shares in connection with a business combination, thereby reducing our cash resources, we may need to secure third party financing in order to successfully effect such a business combination and there can be no assurance that it will be available to us.
Effecting a Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business for an indefinite period of time. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of private units, our shares, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination with a target that has not yet been decided upon. Accordingly, investors in our Class A ordinary shares are investing without first having an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any one or more business combinations. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.

We Have Not Selected a Target Business



To date, we have not selected a specific target business on which to concentrate our search for a business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, promoters and other affiliates have engaged only in preliminary discussions on our behalf with representatives of other companies regarding the possibility of a potential merger, capital stock or share exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination with us. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate a target business or that we will be able to engage in a business combination with a target business on favorable terms or at all.



Subject to our management team’s pre-existing fiduciary obligations and the fair market value requirement described below, we have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses other than as described above. Accordingly, there is no basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete a business combination. Although our management endeavors to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



Sources of Target Businesses



While we have not yet selected a target business with which to consummate our initial business combination, we believe based on our management’s business knowledge and past experience that there are numerous potential candidates. Our principal means of identifying potential target businesses is by leveraging the extensive contacts and relationships of our initial shareholders, officers, and directors.



While our officers and directors are not required to commit any specific amount of time in identifying or performing due diligence on potential target businesses, the relationships that they have developed over their careers and their access to our sponsor’s members’ and affiliates’ contacts and resources have been able to generate a number of potential business combination opportunities that warrant further investigation. Target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community.



Target businesses may also be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, because many of these sources will have read our public disclosures and know what types of businesses we are targeting.



Our officers and directors must present to us all target business opportunities that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income accrued in the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations. We may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on a formal basis, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction.



In no event, however, will our sponsor, initial shareholders, officers, directors or their respective affiliates be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is) other than the $10,000 administrative services fee, the payment of consulting, success or finder fees to our sponsor, officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, the repayment of up to $300,000 of loans and reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses. Our audit committee reviews and approves all reimbursements and payments made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval. We have no present intention to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or sponsor. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (i) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested independent directors and (ii) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view.





10







Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination



We will have 15 months from the closing date of our initial public offering to consummate our initial business combination, which period will be extended (a) an additional three months to a total of 18 months if we have filed (i) a Form 8-K including a definitive merger or acquisition agreement or (ii) a proxy statement, registration statement or similar filing for an initial business combination but have not completed the initial business combination within such 15-month period, (b) up to two instances of an additional three months per instance for a total of up to 18 months or 21 months, respectively, by depositing into the trust account for each three month extension an amount equal to $0.10 per unit or (c) for an additional period as a result of a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (in each case, an “Extension Period”)



Subject to our management team’s pre-existing fiduciary obligations and the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, and that we must acquire a controlling interest in the target business, our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses, except as described above under “Acquisition Strategy and Criteria.”



An evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination is based, to the extent relevant, on such factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review is conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.



The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed results in a loss to us and reduces the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.



Fair Market Value of Target Business 



NYSE listing rules require that the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test.



We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.



Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test.





11







The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and their respective growth rates, book value and/or the market size addressed ). The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public shareholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.



Lack of Business Diversification



We may seek to effect a business combination with more than one target business, although we expect to complete our business combination with just one business. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.



Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management



Although we scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full-time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.



Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination



In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either:




(1) | seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a general meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable); or
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | provide our shareholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each shareholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. Whether we seek shareholder approval or engage in a tender offer, we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon such consummation and, if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination.



We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets either immediately prior to or upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait 15 months (or up to any Extension Period, if applicable) from the closing of our initial public offering in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account. Our sponsor, initial shareholders, officers and directors have agreed:




(1) | to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | not to convert any ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | not sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




None of our officers, directors, sponsor, initial shareholders or their affiliates had indicated any intention to purchase units or Class A ordinary shares as part of our initial public offering or from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination or that they wish to have their shares redeemed, our officers, directors, sponsor, initial shareholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote and reduce the number of redemptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, sponsor, initial shareholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of Class A ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.



Conversion Rights



At any general meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their Class A ordinary shares to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.





13







Our sponsor, initial shareholders and our officers and directors do not have conversion rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to, or following, our initial public offering or purchased by them in the aftermarket.



We may require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination. There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent typically charges the tendering broker $45.00, and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.



Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to shareholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring shareholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the time the shareholder received our proxy statement up until two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his, her or its shares if he, she or it wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the shareholder, whether or not he, she or it is a record holder or his, her or its shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his, her or its shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled “In connection with any general meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, we may require shareholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights” for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.



Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or the expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of Class A ordinary shares delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he or she may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).



If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.



If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 15 months from the closing date of our initial public offering (or up to any Extension Period, if applicable).



Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination



Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that we will have only 15 months from the closing date of our initial public offering (or up to any Extension Period, if applicable) to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such 15-month period or any Extension Period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 15-month time period or any Extension Period. Our initial shareholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founders shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 15 months or during any Extension Period from the closing date of our initial public offering. However, if our initial shareholders acquire public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 15-month time frame or any Extension Period.





14







Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would affect our public shareholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or to modify the substance or timing the redemption rights provided to shareholders as described in this Annual Report or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon completion of our initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules).



We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $1,100,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.



If we were to expend all of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the sale of the private units, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.



Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management performs an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver only if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters as part of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations are limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only third parties we currently engage are vendors such as lawyers, investment bankers, computer or information and technical services providers or prospective target businesses. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.





15







In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (1) $10.20 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.20 per share.



We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to approximately $1,100,000 from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private units, with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.



If we file a winding-up or bankruptcy petition or an involuntary winding-up or bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable insolvency laws, and may be included in our insolvency estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.20 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a winding-up or bankruptcy petition or an involuntary winding-up or bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or insolvency laws as a voidable preference. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.



Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (1) the completion of our initial business combination, and then only in connection with those Class A ordinary shares that such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein, (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would affect our public shareholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or to modify the substance or timing of the redemption rights provided to shareholders as described in this Annual Report, or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (3) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing date of our initial public offering or during any Extension Period, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with our initial business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.

Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association




● | Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain certain requirements and restrictions that apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain a provision which provides that, if we seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would affect our public shareholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing date of our initial public offering or during any Extension Period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, we will provide public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such amendment. Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that: prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a general meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may elect to redeem their public shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote), in each in cash, for an amount payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the completion of our initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon completion of our initial business combination and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | if our initial business combination is not consummated within 15 months from the closing date of our initial public offering or during any Extension Period, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and 


● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (1) receive funds from the trust account or (2) vote as a class with our public shares (a) on any initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (x) extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond 15 months from the closing date of our initial public offering (or up to any Extension Period, if applicable) or (y) amend the foregoing provisions. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of our Class A ordinary shares present and voting at a general meeting. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the ordinary shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon and who vote at a general meeting in favor of the business combination.



Additionally, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, prior to our initial business combination, holders of our founders shares are the only shareholders that will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors and the right to remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may only be amended by a special resolution passed by at least 90% of our ordinary shares voting in a general meeting. With respect to any other matter submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including any vote in connection with our initial business combination, except as required by law, holders of our founders shares and holders of our public shares will vote together as a single class, with each share entitling the holder to one vote.

Comparison of redemption or purchase prices in connection with our initial business combination and if we fail to complete our initial business combination.



The following table compares the redemptions and other permitted purchases of public shares that may take place in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 15 months (or any Extension Period, if applicable) following the closing of our IPO.





 | Redemptions in Connection with our Initial Business Combination | Other Permitted Purchases of Public Shares by our Affiliates | Redemptions if we fail to Complete an Initial Business Combination 
--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Calculation of redemption price | Redemptions at the time of our initial business combination may be made pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a shareholder vote. The redemption price will be the same whether we conduct redemptions pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a shareholder vote. In either case, our public shareholders may redeem their public shares for cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination (which is initially anticipated to be $10.20 per share), including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitation that no redemptions will take place if all of the redemptions would cause our net tangible assets to be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) agreed to in connection with the negotiation of terms of a proposed business combination. | If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, directors, officers, or their respective affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following completion of our initial business combination. Such purchases will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. | If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 15 months (or any Extension Period) from the closing of our IPO, we will redeem all public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (which is initially anticipated to be $10.20 per share), including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses, which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares. 
Impact to remaining shareholders | The redemptions in connection with our initial business combination will reduce the book value per share for our remaining shareholders, who will bear the burden of the deferred underwriting fee and interest withdrawn in order to pay taxes (to the extent not paid from amounts accrued as interest on the funds held in the trust account). | If the permitted purchases described above are made, there will be no impact to our remaining shareholders because the purchase price would not be paid by us. | The redemption of our public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination will reduce the book value per share for the shares held by our sponsor, who will be our only remaining shareholder after such redemptions.

Competition



We face intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources are relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses that we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the sale of the private units, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, in the event we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we are obligated to pay cash for our Class A ordinary shares, it will potentially reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. We may furthermore face competition from other newly-formed entities that may target a business combination transaction with similar focus areas as ours, which may intensify the competition that we face in achieving our objective.
Conflicts of Interest



Certain of our executive officers and directors have or may have fiduciary and contractual duties to certain companies in which they have invested. These entities may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. If these entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing it. However, we do not expect these duties to present a significant conflict of interest with our search for an initial business combination.



Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may need to honor these fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.

One of our directors, Joachim Drees, was formerly a member of the executive management board of TRATON SE (formerly Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH) and is subject to certain restrictions under a termination agreement with TRATON SE. While his appointment as a director of our company was approved by the executive management board of TRATON SE, that executive management board may revoke that approval following our planned business combination if it comes to the conclusion that our company (after combination with a target company) is in direct competition with TRATON SE and its affiliates. In that case, he would be unable to continue serving as our director following the business combination.



Indemnity



Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (1) $10.20 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters as part of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations.
Employees
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, we have three (3) officers, none of whom is an employee of our company. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that our officers or any other members of our management team devote in any time period varies based on the status of our pursuit of a target business for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We registered our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, each of our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors.
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, U.S. GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with PCAOB standards. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.


Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues equal or exceed $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
