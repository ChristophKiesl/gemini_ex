ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
At Cloudera, we believe that data can make what is impossible today, possible tomorrow. We empower people to transform complex data into clear and actionable insights. Powered by the relentless innovation of the open source community, we advance digital transformation for the world's largest enterprises. We deliver an enterprise data cloud for any data, anywhere, from the Edge to AI. We are an enterprise data cloud company.
We pioneered the creation of the enterprise data cloud category. An enterprise data cloud is multi-function, hybrid and multi-cloud, secure and governed, and open and extensible. An enterprise data cloud offers cloud-native agility, elasticity and ease-of-use. 
Since our founding in 2009, we have been a leader in multi-function data management and analytics software, including flow management, streams management, data engineering, data warehousing, streaming analytics, operational databases and machine learning. These solutions function together on the same, or diverse, data sets. In addition, we provide support, professional services and training relating to our offerings. Fundamental to our offerings is shared data experience (SDX) technologies, providing consistent security, governance, lineage and metadata management across the data lifecycle for public cloud, private cloud, or on-premises deployments. Customers implement our software primarily on-premises in data centers, or operate it on the public cloud infrastructure of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure (Azure), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud. Our products integrate the latest innovations in open source data management technology for enterprise-grade performance, scalability and security.
In 2019, we introduced Cloudera Data Platform (CDP), our cloud-native data platform for the enterprise data cloud built on open source software. In August 2020, we announced the general availability of our CDP Private Cloud solution. CDP Private Cloud is a major milestone in our Enterprise Data Cloud strategy. Due to the interoperability between CDP Public and Private Cloud, CDP increases customers’ flexibility and workload deployment options by integrating cloud-native services to create hybrid, multi-cloud capabilities for multi-function data management and analytics. Our customers favor the ability to optimize the performance, cost and security of workloads using data anywhere and across any environment, including multiple public clouds, private cloud and data centers. The ability to optimize any workload in this manner is highly differentiating versus offerings from the public cloud and cloud-only vendors. We believe that our CDP offerings and our CDP roadmap position us as a leader in the emerging enterprise data cloud category.

Our Differentiation
Cloudera empowers organizations to become data-driven enterprises by maximizing the value of their most valuable asset – their data – to grow, connect and protect their business. With CDP, we have built the industry’s first enterprise data cloud, which enables our customers to manage and secure the complete data lifecycle from the Edge to AI on any cloud and data center. The key benefits and differentiators of our solutions include:
•End-to-end data lifecycle integrated from the Edge to AI. We provide an integrated suite of multi-function data management and analytics that enables customers to collect, enrich, analyze, serve and predict with their data to operationalize data insights faster and easier than standalone, siloed analytics services typical of most other cloud data services. Addressing real-world business problems generally requires the entire data lifecycle working together on the same data. Examples include connected and autonomous vehicles, optimizing 5G mobile networks, anti-money laundering, fraud detection and risk modeling. Point providers of analytics services generally only offer one or two services. Cloud service provider offerings typically are not integrated, having been acquired and built independently. CDP performs and manages multiple analytic functions of the data lifecycle – flow management, streams management, data engineering, data warehousing, streaming analytics, operational databases and machine learning.
•Hybrid and multi-cloud deployments at scale. Our platforms allow enterprises to manage the data lifecycle for both long-lived and transient workloads across environments, mixing on-premises and public cloud infrastructure, including all major public cloud vendors – AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud. Customers can deploy, configure and monitor their clusters and workloads at scale from a centralized interface across these environments. We offer configurable monitoring, reporting and robust troubleshooting to provide management of large, growing data sets and concurrent use cases. Cloud service providers offer only a single cloud with some offering options to extend their cloud on-premises; they do not offer multi-cloud, hybrid cloud or private cloud capabilities. Point service providers may operate across multiple clouds, but not hybrid and private clouds. CDP manages and secures the data lifecycle on any cloud and data center. 
•Enterprise-grade data security and governance with SDX. Our platform uses proprietary authentication, network isolation, user-and role-based permissions, access logging, auditing, lineage and encryption including sophisticated key management to provide comprehensive, enterprise-grade data security across multiple analytic workloads. The native security features of our platforms require no additional third-party licenses, reducing costs to our customers. In addition, our platforms enable regulatory and industry-specific compliance through comprehensive data governance, including data discovery, data lineage, metadata tagging and policy enforcement. CDP secures the data lifecycle on any cloud or data center.
•Cloud-native platform. CDP offers cloud-native services for the data lifecycle that leverage containers and kubernetes technologies. These services are simple, fast and easy for enterprise IT to deliver to business intelligence (BI) analysts, data scientists, data engineers and developers. Cloud-native services simplify the use of our platforms by eliminating the need to install, manage and update our software. We also enable customers to address a new set of elastic and transient workloads that would otherwise be impractical to run in a data center. CDP delivers cloud-native simplicity across public and private clouds.
•Enable customers to leverage open source innovation. Our platforms integrate the latest innovations in open source data management technology. We were the first data platform vendor to incorporate Spark and have demonstrated continuous commitment to open source through our adoption of projects such as NiFi, Kafka, Flink, Impala, Hive, HBase, Spark and more. We enable customers to capitalize on the business value of the latest open source technologies through our integrated, secure and high-performance platform. As announced, we expect our primary solutions to be 100% open source in the future.
•High performance scalability for low total cost of ownership. Our platforms deliver performance improvements over legacy systems at lower cost. Using our software, customers can scale to hundreds of petabytes of data under management, and select the infrastructure environment – cloud and/or datacenter – that is most cost-effective and appropriate for each use case.

Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we actively seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements, licenses and intellectual property assignment agreements. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we therefore may be unable to protect our proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions. Moreover, our platform incorporates software components licensed to the general public under open source software licenses such as the Apache 2.0 Software License. We obtain many components from software developed and released by contributors to independent open source components of our platform. Open source licenses grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify and redistribute our platform. As a result, open source development and licensing practices can limit the value of our software copyright assets. 
As of January 31, 2021, we had been granted 53 U.S. patents and had 24 U.S. patent applications pending. Our patents expire between 2030 and 2041. We also had 18 issued patents and four patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. To protect our brand, we file trademark registrations in some jurisdictions.

Diversity and Inclusion
Innovation at Cloudera comes from the diverse perspectives, knowledge, and experiences of our employees. We strive to create an inclusive workplace where people can bring their authentic selves to work. We employ inclusive recruitment practices to source diverse candidates and mitigate potential bias.
In fiscal 2021, we formed the Equality Committee responsible for guiding and informing the executive team. The mission of the Equality Committee is to build a company on the foundations of diversity, equality, fairness, and inclusion, embracing the community and leading the industry by becoming a beacon of change for others to emulate. One of the committee’s recommendations was to hire a Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) reporting directly to the CEO. In fiscal 2021, we appointed a CDO and invested in this important function.
Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (or DE&I) Team’s mission is to build a more diverse and inclusive company through clear and measurable goals across all levels and geographies, and encouraging and enabling all Clouderans to drive change and create an inclusive environment for everyone every day through educational, professional, and social programs. The vision of the DE&I team is to build a Cloudera that reflects the diversity of our communities and foster an environment where everyone feels they can be their true selves. The DE&I team seeks to achieve this vision by focusing on efforts that have been studied to show results, such as voluntary training, using disaggregated data to provide transparency into the fabric of our company, disassembling the employee lifecycle and re-engineering it so that all team members have equal access to a level playing field, targeting early talent recruiting, sponsorship, and creating employee-driven diversity teams.
In addition, we have active Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are groups formed by employees across all demographics - race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, disability, etc. These ERGs work as strategic partners within Cloudera to promote a culture of diversity and inclusion through continual learning and networking. In fiscal 2021, we renewed our dedication to supporting these ERGs and their activities. 
Compensation, Benefits and Well-being
We offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being. To ensure alignment with our short- and long-term objectives, our compensation programs for all employees include base pay, short-term incentives, and opportunities for long-term incentives. We offer a wide array of benefits including comprehensive health and welfare insurance, paid time-off and leaves, and retirement support. We provide a wide variety of health and wellness resources through our employee portal. Our gym reimbursement program in the United States further helps to support employees’ physical well-being.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. We have also provided a work-from-home reimbursement program, as well as online cooking and yoga classes, weekly newsletters to assist employees in that transition. To create a specific focus on the mental health and wellbeing of our employees, we created the “Unplug” program that provides several company-wide paid days off to help employees balance their work and life responsibilities.
Growth and Development
Career development is a primary reason new hires decide to join Cloudera and existing employees decide to stay at Cloudera. Therefore, we actively foster a learning culture where employees are empowered to drive their career progression, supporting professional development and providing on-demand learning platforms. Employees enjoy numerous learning platforms including O’Reilly, Gartner, and Udemy. Our education reimbursement program offers each eligible employee up to $10,500 per year for long-term undergraduate and graduate studies, as well as short-term professional development.
