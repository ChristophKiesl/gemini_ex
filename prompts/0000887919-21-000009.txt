Item 1.  Description of Business
THE COMPANY

Premier Financial Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company" or "Premier") is a multi-bank holding company and financial holding company that, as of March 6, 2020 operates thirteen banking offices in Kentucky, three banking offices in Ohio, twenty-six banking offices in West Virginia, four banking offices in Washington, DC, one banking office in Maryland and three banking offices in Virginia. At December 31, 2020, Premier had total consolidated assets of $1.946 billion, total consolidated deposits of $1.634 billion and total consolidated stockholders' equity of $259.9 million. The banking subsidiaries (the "Banks" or "Affiliate Banks") consist of Citizens Deposit Bank and Trust, Inc., Vanceburg, Kentucky and Premier Bank, Inc., Huntington, West Virginia.

Premier was incorporated as a Kentucky corporation in 1991 and has functioned as a bank holding company since its formation. During 2002, Premier moved its principal executive offices from Georgetown, Kentucky to its present location at 2883 5th Avenue, Huntington, West Virginia, 25702. The purpose of the move was to be more centrally located among Premier's Affiliate Banks and its directorship. Premier's telephone number is (304) 525-1600.

Premier is a legal entity separate and distinct from its Affiliate Banks. Accordingly, the right of Premier, and thus the right of Premier's creditors and shareholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any of the Affiliate Banks is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of such subsidiaries, except to the extent that claims of Premier, in its capacity as a creditor, may be recognized. The principal source of Premier's revenue is dividends from its Affiliate Banks.  See "REGULATORY MATTERS -- Dividend Restrictions" for discussion of the restrictions on the Affiliate Banks' ability to pay dividends to Premier.

In late 2007 Premier resumed a strategy of franchise expansion by acquiring and owning community banks.  On October 24, 2007, the Company entered into a material definitive agreement with Citizens First Bank, Inc. (“Citizens First”), a bank with $60 million of total assets located in Ravenswood, West Virginia.  Under terms of the definitive agreement, Premier agreed to purchase Citizens First for up to $11.7 million in stock and cash.  Each share of Citizens First common stock was entitled to merger consideration of cash and stock that generally totaled $29.25, subject to certain limitations.  Premier issued 660,000 shares of its common stock plus Premier paid $5.3 million in cash to the shareholders of Citizens First.

On November 27, 2007, the Company entered into a material definitive agreement with Traders Bankshares, Inc. (Traders), a single bank holding company with $108 million of total assets located in Spencer, West Virginia.  Under terms of the definitive agreement, Premier agreed to purchase Traders for approximately $18.1 million in stock and cash.  Each share of Traders common stock was entitled to merger consideration of $50.00 cash and 5.156 shares of Premier common stock.  Premier issued approximately 928,125 shares of its common stock plus Premier paid $9.0 million in cash to the shareholders of Traders.

On April 30, 2008, Premier closed the acquisitions of Citizens First and Traders.  On October 25, 2008, Premier merged these two new subsidiary banks together to form Traders Bank, Inc. headquartered in Ravenswood, West Virginia.  The merger was designed to consolidate management and operations of two subsidiaries in overlapping or contiguous markets.  Similarly, effective January 3, 2005, Premier merged two of its subsidiary banks, Citizens Deposit Bank & Trust in Vanceburg, Kentucky and Bank of Germantown, in Germantown, Kentucky. Bank of Germantown was merged into Citizens Deposit Bank, with its facilities continuing to operate as branches of Citizens Deposit Bank.

On December 31, 2008, the Company entered into a material definitive agreement with Abigail Adams National Bancorp, Inc. (“Abigail Adams”), a two bank holding company (Adams National Bank and Consolidated Bank & Trust Company) with $436 million of total assets at December 31, 2008 with locations in and around Washington, DC and Richmond, Virginia.  Under terms of the definitive agreement, Premier agreed to purchase Abigail Adams for approximately $10.8 million in stock.  The acquisition closed on October 1, 2009.  Each share of Abigail Adams common stock was entitled to merger consideration of 0.6134 shares of Premier common stock.  Premier issued approximately 2,124,375 shares of its common stock to the shareholders of Abigail Adams.  Premier participated in the U.S. Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) to help fund the rehabilitation of Adams National and provide the additional capital needed to maintain the Company’s healthy capital ratios after consummating the merger with Abigail Adams.

On September 10, 2010 Citizens Deposit Bank and Trust, Inc. (“Citizens Deposit”) completed its purchase of four banking offices from Integra Bank located in Maysville and Mt. Olivet, Kentucky, and Ripley and Aberdeen, Ohio.  The purchase of the branches was a strategic move to increase Citizens Deposit’s presence in its current market area without a significant increase in its operating costs. Citizens Deposit paid a $2.4 million deposit premium for the deposit liabilities it assumed and also acquired $17.8 million of branch related loans as well as $34.0 million of additional commercial real estate loans and $10.0 million of other commercial loans selected by Citizens Deposit originated from other Integra offices.  The four banking offices were also included in the branch purchase.  The purchase resulted in approximately $1.1 million of goodwill and $2.0 million in core deposit intangible.

On February 28, 2011, Premier received final regulatory approval to move forward with its plans to merge Boone County Bank, headquartered in Madison, West Virginia; First Central Bank, headquartered in Philippi, West Virginia; Traders Bank, Inc., headquartered in Ravenswood, West Virginia; Adams National Bank, headquartered in Washington, DC and Consolidated Bank & Trust, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, to form Premier Bank, Inc. (“Premier Bank”).  The merger was completed on April 9, 2011.  The resulting bank is headquartered in Huntington, West Virginia.

One of the goals achieved by merging the bank charters together was to alleviate the restrictions placed on the Company’s operations by written agreements previously entered into by Adams National with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, (“OCC”) and Consolidated Bank and Trust Company, (“CB&T”) with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, (“FRB”).  With the surrender of the Adams National charter upon consummation of the merger to form Premier Bank, Inc., the written agreement with the OCC was terminated.  Similarly, with the merger of CB&T into Premier Bank, Inc., the provisions of the written agreement with the FRB that applied to CB&T were concluded.

With the merger of Adams National and CB&T into Boone County Bank in the formation of Premier Bank, Abigail Adams as a corporate entity was no longer needed.  As such, it was merged into Premier on May 16, 2011.  Likewise, Premier’s other non-banking subsidiary, Mt. Vernon Financial Holdings, Inc. (“Mt. Vernon”), had completed its purpose by liquidating substantially all of a pool of loans remaining from the sale of the Bank of Mt. Vernon in 2001.  In September 2011, any remaining loans owned by Mt. Vernon were contributed as capital to Premier’s subsidiary bank, Citizens Deposit, and then on September 27, 2011, Mt. Vernon was also merged into Premier.

On May 13, 2010, Premier executed a six-year data processing agreement with Fidelity Information Services, Inc. and its affiliates (“FIS”) located in Jacksonville, Florida.  The agreement covers Premier’s core data processing, item processing, internet banking services, network services, customer authentication services and electronic funds transfer services.  Beginning in May 2011 and concluding in September 2011, Premier and FIS converted each of the subsidiary (or former subsidiary) bank’s systems to the FIS “Horizon” platform.  It was during this process that the data systems of the five subsidiary banks that merged to form Premier Bank, converted and combined into one system. On March 31, 2017, Premier executed a five-year extension of its data processing agreement with FIS.   While the extension agreement became effective on April 1, 2017, the data processing agreement was extended five-years from the original September 2011 termination date.  The contract continues to cover Premier’s core data processing, item processing, mobile and internet banking services, network services, customer authentication services, and electronic funds transfer services.  The data processing agreement shall remain in effect until September 30, 2022 and provides for automatic five-year extensions after that date.

In 2012, Premier merged Ohio River Bank, headquartered in Ironton, Ohio and Farmers Deposit Bank, headquartered in Eminence, Kentucky with and into Premier’s wholly owned subsidiary Citizens Deposit Bank & Trust, headquartered in Vanceburg, Kentucky.

Effective with the close of business on April 4, 2014, Premier completed its purchase of the Bank of Gassaway (“Gassaway”), a $201.52 million bank headquartered in Gassaway, West Virginia.  Under terms of an amended and restated agreement of merger dated January 3, 2014, Premier Bank, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Premier, paid $20.25 million in cash for the Bank of Gassaway and merged Gassaway’s five branch locations into its operating systems.  The resulting merger expanded Premier Bank’s footprint into central West Virginia along the I-79 corridor.

On June 12, 2014, Citizens Deposit opened a de novo branch in Fort Wright, Kentucky in the southern Cincinnati, Ohio metro area in an effort to expand the bank’s operations into a more urban market.  On June 13, 2015, Citizens Deposit closed its Aberdeen and South Webster, Ohio branches in a strategic move to reduce its cost structure.  On August 3, 2015, Citizens Deposit opened a de novo branch in Florence, Kentucky, its second de novo branch in the southern Cincinnati, Ohio metro area.  In 2018, Citizens Deposit opened two de novo branches.  On April 9, 2018, Citizens Deposit completed the purchase of a branch building in Huntington, West Virginia and began operating the facility as a full-service bank branch.  On December 17, 2018, Citizens Deposit opened a full-service bank branch in Cold Spring, Kentucky, its third branch location in the southern Cincinnati, Ohio metro area.  These branch transactions are part of a strategic effort to position the bank as a strong community bank, with a low-cost structure and a high opportunity for profitable loans in expanding markets along the Ohio River.

On July 6, 2015, Premier and First National Bankshares Corporation (“Bankshares”), a $245 million single bank holding company (as of December 31, 2015) headquartered in Ronceverte, West Virginia jointly announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement of merger.  Under terms of the definitive agreement of merger, each share of Bankshares common stock was entitled to merger consideration of 2.324 shares of Premier common stock.  Premier issued approximately 1,935,300 shares of its common stock to the shareholders of Bankshares valued at approximately $22.0 million.  Effective with the close of business on March 4, 2016, Premier merged its newly acquired wholly owned subsidiary First National Bank (“First National”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bankshares, with and into its wholly owned subsidiary Premier Bank, Inc.  The resulting merger expanded Premier Bank’s footprint into the Greenbrier Valley of West Virginia and into Covington, Virginia along Interstate 64 with six branch locations.

Premier elected to become a financial holding company effective October 5, 2017.  For further information on financial holding companies see Regulatory Matters - Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act below.

Under the terms of the definitive agreement of merger, as amended, each share of First Bank common stock was entitled to receive 1.199 shares of Premier common stock and $5.00 cash from Premier, with Premier issuing approximately 1.249 million shares as a result of the acquisition.  In addition to the cash and shares of common stock from Premier, First Bank shareholders also received a regulatorily approved special dividend of $5.00 per share from the equity of First Bank as part of the acquisition transaction.  In conjunction with the acquisition by Premier, First Bank was merged into Premier Bank, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Premier.  The resulting merger expanded Premier Bank’s full service footprint into the Charleston, West Virginia market place.

On July 9, 2019, Premier and The First National Holding Company of Jackson (“First Holding”), a $100 million single bank holding company headquartered in Jackson, Kentucky jointly announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement whereby Citizens Deposit would acquire The First National Bank of Jackson, (“Jackson”), the wholly owned subsidiary of First Holding, in a cash purchase.  The merger was completed effective with the close of business on October 25, 2019 in a cash purchase valued at approximately $14.6 million.

BUSINESS

General


Through the Banks the Company focuses on providing quality community banking services to individuals and small-to-medium sized businesses. By seeking to provide such banking services in non-urban areas, the Company believes that it can minimize the competitive effect of larger financial institutions that typically are focused on large metropolitan areas. Where the Company owns branches in urban areas, such as the Washington, DC Metro Area, Richmond, Virginia and the Cincinnati, Ohio Metro Area, the Company believes the nimble nature of its operations and local decision making process allow it to compete effectively with larger financial institutions.  Each Bank retains its local management structure which offers customers direct access to the Bank's president or regional president and other officers in an environment conducive to friendly, informed and courteous service. This approach also enables each Bank to offer local and timely decision-making, flexible and reasonable operating procedures and credit policies limited only by a framework of centralized risk controls provided by the Company to promote prudent banking practices. See additional discussion under "Regulatory Matters" below.

Each Bank maintains its community orientation by, among other things, having selected members of its community as members of its board of directors, who assist in the introduction of prospective customers to the Bank and in the development or modification of products and services to meet customer needs. As a result of the development of personal banking relationships with its customers and the convenience and service offered by the Banks, the Banks' lending and investing activities are funded primarily by core deposits.

When appropriate and economically advantageous, the Company centralizes certain of the Banks' back office, support and investment functions in order to achieve consistency and cost efficiency in the delivery of products and services. The Company centrally provides services such as accounting, loan review, information technology operations and network support, human resources, compliance and internal auditing to the Banks to enhance their ability to compete effectively. The Company also provides overall direction in the areas of credit policy and administration, strategic planning, marketing, investment portfolio management, regulatory compliance and other financial and administrative services. Each Bank participates in product development by advising management of new products and services needed by its customers and desirable changes to existing products and services.  Company senior management along with each Bank's management periodically review and standardize their offering of products and services, although pricing decisions remain at the local level.

The Company utilizes a large multi-national external third party provider for its core data processing systems.  As a result, the Company through the Banks is able offer more modern products, such as internet banking, mobile banking and check imaging, plus is able to take advantage of modern technologies such as image exchange to remit and clear items with its exchange agents. The Company has also integrated its automated teller machine network, improved its management reporting systems, adopted an integrated image-based document storage system, and offers mobile banking via smart phones and other hand-held computing devices.

Each of the Banks provides a wide range of retail and commercial banking services, including commercial, real estate, agricultural and consumer lending; depository and funds transfer services; collections; safe deposit boxes; cash management services; and other services tailored for both individuals and businesses.

The Banks' residential mortgage lending activities consist primarily of loans for purchasing personal residences or loans for commercial or consumer purposes secured by residential mortgages.  The Banks typically only retain mortgage loans with variable interest rate terms due to the longer amortization periods associated with mortgage lending.  For customers who desire fixed rate mortgage terms, the Banks take customer applications for third party mortgage vendors, and in turn receive a commission for their services.  The Banks’ mortgage originators are salaried employees who do not receive a commission or other incentive compensation for the number or type of mortgages they originate.  Consumer lending activities consist of traditional forms of financing for automobile and personal loans including unsecured lines of credit. Commercial lending activities include loans to small to medium-sized businesses located primarily in the communities in which the Banks have branch locations and surrounding areas. Commercial loans are generally secured by business assets including real estate, equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable. Some commercial loans are unsecured.  The branches located in larger metro areas, such as Washington DC, Richmond Virginia, and Cincinnati Ohio, also offer opportunities for larger commercial and commercial real estate loans.  These opportunities are subject to Premier’s strict credit underwriting policies and procedures.

The Banks' range of deposit services includes checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, club accounts, individual retirement accounts, certificates of deposit and overdraft protection. Customers can access their accounts via traditional bank branch locations as well as Automated Teller Machines (ATM’s) and the internet either via personal computers or mobile computing devices such as smart phones.  The Banks also offer bill payment, remote deposits via image capture devices and mobile computing devices, person to person payments via mobile computing devices, and telephone banking services.  Deposits of the Banks are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund administered by the FDIC to the maximum amounts offered by the FDIC.

Competition


The Banks encounter strong competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. The widespread enactment of state laws that permit multi-bank holding companies as well as the availability of nationwide interstate banking and internet banking have created a highly competitive environment for financial services providers. In one or more aspects of its business, each Bank competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, electronic payment facilitators, software companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, and other financial intermediaries operating in its market and elsewhere, many of which have substantially greater financial and managerial resources. While the Banks are smaller financial institutions by comparison, each of the Banks' competitors include large bank holding companies having substantially greater resources and offering certain services that the Affiliate Banks may not currently provide. Each Bank seeks to minimize the competitive effect of larger organizations through a community banking approach that emphasizes direct customer access to the Bank's regional presidents and other officers in an environment conducive to friendly, informed and courteous service.  Furthermore, via the Company’s credit administration department, the Banks can also minimize the competitive effects of larger organizations by tailoring their lending criteria to the individual circumstances of the small-to-medium sized business owner.

Management believes that each Bank is positioned to compete successfully in its respective primary market area, although no assurances as to ongoing competitiveness can be given. Competition among financial institutions is based upon interest rates offered on deposit accounts, service charges on deposit accounts for various services related to customer convenience, interest rates charged on loans and other credit, the quality and scope of the services rendered, the convenience of the banking facilities and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. Management believes that the commitment of its Banks to personal service, innovation and involvement in their respective communities and primary market areas, as well as their commitment to quality community banking service, are factors that contribute to their competitiveness.

Regulatory Matters


The following discussion sets forth certain elements of the regulatory framework applicable to financial holding companies, bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information relevant to Premier. This regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the federal deposit insurance funds and not for the protection of the holders of securities, including Premier’s common shares. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to those provisions. A change in the statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to Premier or its subsidiaries may have a material effect on the business of Premier.

December 31, 2020

General - As a bank holding company and financial holding company, Premier is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act ("BHC Act"), and to inspection, examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve"). Under the BHC Act, bank holding companies generally may not acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all the assets of any company, including a bank, without the Federal Reserve's prior approval. Similarly, bank holding companies generally may not acquire ownership or control of a savings association without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Further, branching by the Affiliate Banks is subject to the jurisdiction, and requires the approval of each Affiliate Bank's primary federal banking regulator and, if the Affiliate Bank is a state-chartered bank, the appropriate state banking regulator.

Under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the Federal Reserve's determination that such activity or control constitutes a risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. Premier and the Affiliate Banks are subject to the Federal Reserve Act, which limits borrowings by Premier (and any nonbank subsidiaries) from the Affiliate Banks and also limits various other transactions between Premier (and any nonbank subsidiaries) and the Affiliate Banks.

Citizens Deposit Bank and Trust, Inc. is chartered in Kentucky and supervised, regulated and examined by the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions.  Premier Bank, Inc. is chartered in West Virginia and supervised, regulated and examined by the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions.  In addition, the Affiliate Banks are supervised and regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). Each banking regulator has the authority to issue cease-and-desist orders if it determines that the activities of a bank regularly represent an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of law.

Both federal and state law extensively regulates various aspects of the banking business, such as loan loss reserve and capital requirements, truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings disclosure, mortgage origination disclosures and ability to repay requirements, equal credit opportunity, fair credit reporting, trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations. Premier and the Affiliate Banks are also affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the Federal Reserve and by various other governmental laws, regulations and requirements. Further, the earnings of Premier and Affiliate Banks are affected by general economic conditions and prevailing interest rates. Legislation and administrative actions affecting the banking industry are frequently considered by the United States Congress, state legislatures and various regulatory agencies. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether such legislation or administrative actions will be enacted or the extent to which the banking industry, in general, or Premier and the Affiliate Banks, in particular, would be affected.

Liability for Bank Subsidiaries - The Federal Reserve has a policy to the effect that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to maintain resources adequate to support each such subsidiary bank.  This support may be required at times when Premier may not have the resources to provide it. In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.

Any depository institution insured by the FDIC may be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution, or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution in danger of default. "Default" is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver and "in danger of default" is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a "default" is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. In the event that such a default occurred with respect to a bank, any loans to the bank from its parent holding company will be subordinate in right of payment of the bank's depositors and certain of its other obligations.

Capital Requirements - Premier is subject to capital ratios, requirements and guidelines imposed by the Federal Reserve, which are substantially similar to the ratios, requirements and guidelines imposed by the FDIC on the Banks. These capital requirements establish higher capital standards for banks and bank holding companies that assume greater credit risks. For this purpose, a bank's or holding company's assets and certain specified off-balance sheet commitments are assigned to risk categories, each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments. A bank's or holding company's capital is divided into two tiers: "Tier 1" capital and "Tier 2" capital. "Tier 1" capital includes common stockholders' equity, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and related surplus (excluding auction rate issues), minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries plus cumulative perpetual preferred stock and Trust Preferred Securities both of which are subject to certain limitations. Goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets are subtracted from these sources of capital to calculate Tier 1 capital. "Tier 2" capital includes, among other items, perpetual preferred stock not meeting the Tier 1 definition, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations, less certain required deductions.  Effective January 1, 2015, bank and bank holding company regulatory agencies adopted rules defining a subset of Tier 1 capital referred to as “Common Equity Tier 1” capital, or “CET1” capital, in accordance with the Basil III accord.  CET1 capital includes only the common stockholders’ equity of the entity before deducting elements such as goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets.  Prior to the acquisition of Bankshares, Premier’s CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital were identical because all of Premier’s Tier 1 capital was common shareholders’ equity.  In conjunction with the acquisition of Bankshares on January 15, 2016, Premier assumed $6.0 million of Trust Preferred Securities held by Bankshares which are eligible for inclusion in Premier’s Tier 1 capital but are excluded from its CET1 capital.
PREMIER FINANCIAL BANCORP, INC.
 FORM 10-K

December 31, 2020

Bank holding companies currently are required to maintain CET1 capital, Tier I capital and total capital (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) equal to at least 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0% of total risk-weighted assets, respectively.
 In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the Federal Reserve requires bank holding companies to maintain a minimum "leverage ratio" (Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets) of 3.0%, if the holding company has the highest regulatory ratings for risk-based capital purposes. All other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 3.0% plus at least 100 to 200 basis points.
 The foregoing capital requirements are minimum requirements. The Federal Reserve may set capital requirements higher than the minimums described above for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing or anticipating significant growth may be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions, well above the minimum levels.
 Additionally, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"), among other things, identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) and requires the respective federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for “prompt corrective action” for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements.
 An “undercapitalized” bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee the bank's compliance with the plan. The liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of 5% of the Bank's assets at the time it became “undercapitalized” or the amount needed to comply with the plan.  Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company, such guarantee would take priority over the parent's general unsecured creditors. In addition, FDICIA requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non-capital standards for safety and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards.

Capital Requirements and Phase-in of Capital Buffer – Beginning on January 1, 2015, the standard for minimum regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio the Banks must maintain in order to be considered “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action increased from 6.00% to 8.00%.  Also beginning on January 1, 2015, a new measure of capital adequacy was added for the Banks to be considered “well capitalized”.  The Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio, or CET1 Ratio, restricts the capital to be included in the ratio to common stockholders’ equity and requires a minimum ratio of 6.50% of risk-weighted assets for a bank to be considered “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  The equity of both of Premier’s subsidiary banks are already 100% common stockholders’ equity and therefore there was no adverse impact from the implementation of the new capital ratio.
 Beginning on January 1, 2016 an additional capital conservation buffer was added to the minimum regulatory capital ratios under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  The capital conservation buffer is measured as a percentage of risk weighted assets and was phased-in over the four year period from 2016 thru 2019.  The capital conservation buffer requirement is 2.50% of risk weighted assets over and above the regulatory minimum capital ratios for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1) to risk weighted assets, Tier 1 Capital to risk weighted assets, and Total Capital to risk weighted assets.  The consequences of not meeting the capital conservation buffer thresholds include restrictions on the payment of dividends, restrictions on the payment of discretionary bonuses, and restrictions on the repurchasing of common shares by the Company.
 Regulatory Capital Simplification – Community Bank Leverage Ratio –          In 2020, Premier and its subsidiary banks elected to adopt regulatory capital simplification rules permitting banks and bank holding companies of Premier’s size to utilize one measure of regulatory capital, the community bank leverage ratio (also known as the “CBLR”), to determine regulatory capital adequacy.  The community bank leverage ratio requires a higher amount of Tier 1 capital to average assets than the standard leverage ratio to be considered well capitalized.  However, meeting this higher standard eliminates the need to compute and monitor the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the total risk-based capital ratio as well as maintain the 2.50% regulatory capital buffer necessary to avoid limitations on equity distributions and discretionary bonus payments.  Other criteria required to be able to utilize the CBLR as the sole measure of capital adequacy include 1.) total assets less than $10.0 billion, 2.) trading assets and liabilities equal to less than 5.0% of total assets and 3.) off-balance sheet exposures, such as the unused portion of conditionally cancellable lines of credit, equal to less than 25% of total assets.  Premier meets all three of these criteria and has elected to utilize the CBLR as its measure of regulatory capital adequacy on a consolidated basis as well as for its subsidiary banks.

December 31, 2020

Under interim guidance issued in June 2020, a community bank leverage ratio of Total Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets must be at least 8.00% to be considered well capitalized.  Premier's Tier 1 capital totaled $207.8 million at December 31, 2020, which represents a community bank leverage ratio of 11.25%.  Premier’s wholly owned subsidiary Citizens Deposit Bank adopted the CBLR simplification standard and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.36% at December 31, 2020.  Premier’s other wholly owned subsidiary bank, Premier Bank, Inc. also adopted the regulatory capital simplification rules in 2020 and maintained a CBLR of 10.71% at December 31, 2020, well in excess of the 8.00% required to be considered well capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework.  The interim guidance increases the required CBLR to 8.50% as of March 31, 2021 and finally to 9.00% by March 31, 2022.
 As shown in the table in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements regarding stockholders’ equity, the capital ratios of Premier and the Affiliate Banks exceed the applicable requirements at the time to be considered well capitalized at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
 Dividend Restrictions - Premier is dependent on dividends from its Affiliate Banks for its revenues. Various federal and state regulatory provisions limit the amount of dividends the Affiliate Banks can pay to Premier without regulatory approval. At December 31, 2020, approximately $12.3 million of the total stockholders' equity of the Affiliate Banks was available for payment of dividends to Premier without approval by the applicable regulatory authority.
 In addition, federal bank regulatory authorities have authority to prohibit Premier's Affiliate Banks from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting their business. The payment of dividends, depending upon the financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. The ability of the Affiliate Banks to pay dividends in the future is presently, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines as well as each Affiliate Bank's earnings and financial condition.  Additional information regarding dividend limitations can be found in Note 20 of the consolidated financial statements.

Interstate Banking - Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the "Riegle-Neal Act"), subject to certain concentration limits, (i) bank holding companies, such as Premier, are permitted to acquire banks and bank holding companies located in any state of the United States, subject to certain restrictions, and (ii) banks are permitted to acquire branch offices outside their home state by merging with out-of-state banks, purchasing branches in other states or establishing de novo branch offices in other states; provided that, in the case of any such purchase or opening of individual branches, the host state has adopted legislation "opting in" to the relevant provisions of the Riegle-Neal Act; and provided further, that, in the case of a merger with a bank located in another state, the host state has not adopted legislation "opting out" of the relevant provisions of the Riegle-Neal Act.
 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act - On November 12, 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( “GLBA”) was signed into law, eliminating many of the remaining barriers to full convergence of the banking, securities, and insurance industries. The major provisions of GLBA took effect March 12, 2000.  GLBA enables a broad-scale consolidation among banks, securities firms, and insurance companies by creating a new type of financial services company called a “financial holding company," a bank holding company with dramatically expanded powers. Financial holding companies can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting), and merchant banking. In addition, GLBA permits the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to authorize additional activities for financial holding companies, but only if they jointly determine that such activities are "financial in nature" or "complementary to financial activities."  Premier elected to become a financial holding company effective October 5, 2017.
 The Federal Reserve serves as the primary "umbrella" regulator of financial holding companies, with jurisdiction over the parent company and more limited oversight over its subsidiaries. The primary regulator of each subsidiary of a financial holding company depends on the activities conducted by the subsidiary. A financial holding company need not obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to engaging, either de novo or through acquisitions, in financial activities previously determined to be permissible by the Federal Reserve. Instead, a financial holding company need only provide notice to the Federal Reserve within 30 days after commencing the new activity or consummating the acquisition.
 Dodd-Frank Act - On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law, implementing far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including provisions that, among other things:
 
• | created a new agency to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which will be responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | applied the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies;

 CARES Act – On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020, as amended (the “CARES Act”), was signed into law to provide national emergency economic relief measures in response to the novel COVID-19 pandemic.  Many of the CARES Act’s programs are dependent upon the direct involvement of U.S. financial institutions and have been implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board and other federal banking agencies, including those with direct supervisory jurisdiction over Premier and the Affiliate Banks.

In accordance with the CARES Act, regulatory guidance was issued that clarified the accounting for loan modifications made by banks on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 that would normally be considered Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”) to be exempt from the TDR rules.  To qualify under the CARES Act, a loan could not be past due at the time the payment modification was granted.  Premier has made payment modifications on loans to borrowers who were current on their loan prior to the CARES Act, including short-term periods (generally 90-days or less) of full payment deferrals and/or short-term periods of requiring payments of interest-only.   Modifications of loan terms under the CARES Act have been extended depending on individual borrower’s circumstances.  These rules were originally set to expire at the end of 2020 but have been extended for another year to the end of 2021.  Additional information regarding the amount and types of loans as of December 31, 2020 that have some level of remaining payment modification under the CARES Act can be found in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements.

The CARES Act also established the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”).  The SBA PPP loan program, as originally enacted, provided qualifying small business borrowers with a fixed rate loan bearing an interest rate of 1.00%, a 24-month maturity date, and payment deferrals for the first six months of the loan.  The loans required no collateral and are fully guaranteed, both principal and interest, by the Small Business Administration and the U. S. Treasury.  Loan amounts per borrower were limited to an amount approximating two and one-half months of their average payroll expense during the calendar year 2019.  A key feature of the loan program is that borrowers can receive repayment forgiveness by the SBA for the portion of their loan proceeds that were expended on certain employee payroll related costs and qualifying premises and equipment costs during the eight weeks following loan disbursement, up to 100% of the loan amount.  In June 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act was enacted, which modified the PPP loan program to allow borrowers up to twenty-four weeks to expend the proceeds on those qualifying expenses.  Upon forgiveness, the bank would be reimbursed by the SBA for the forgiveness portion and any accrued interest thereon.  Any remaining balance would be repaid by the borrower over the remaining eighteen months to loan maturity.  A subsequent change to the program will allow borrowers an option to extend the repayment period up to 60 months if the bank agrees to the extension.  Management believes that with the expanded timeframe to make the qualifying expenditures, most of the outstanding loan balance made to borrowers will qualify for forgiveness.  In addition to the 1.00% stated interest rate, the SBA pays the loan originating bank a fee based upon a percentage of the loan amount.  The fee percentage decreases based upon a ladder of increases in the size of the loan.  The original PPP loan program ended on June 30, 2020.


 On Dec. 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act was signed into law to further assist businesses who have been financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the Paycheck Protection Program’s second-draw loan program was created (“Round 2”).  This program will allow eligible businesses with additional loans, similar to those from the original PPP loan program.  Eligibility for Round 2 PPP loans generally has certain restrictions including businesses with 300 or fewer employees, businesses must have experienced at least a 25% reduction in revenue in 2020 compared to 2019, and the maximum loan amount for the second loan is the lesser of $2 million or two and half months of the business’ average monthly payroll.  There are limited exceptions to these eligibility requirements.  Premier began processing applications for Round 2 PPP loans in January 2021 and the eligibility for Round 2 loans expires on March 31, 2021.  Additional information regarding Premier’s participation in the PPP loan program as of December 31, 2020 can be found in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements.

Employees and Human Capital Resources

The Company and its subsidiaries collectively had 337 full-time employees and 34 part-time employees as of December 31, 2020.  It is through our employees, and their ties to the local community, that we are able to dutifully support the communities we serve.  We believe that the strength and commitment of our workforce to our communities is what sets us apart from other community banks.
Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.  Our human capital measures and objectives focus on safety of our employees, employee compensation and benefits, and employee development and training. All of our employees are at will employees, which means that each employee can terminate his or her relationship with us and we can terminate our relationship with him or her at any time.

We believe our ability to attract and retain employees is a key to our success. Accordingly, we strive to offer competitive salaries and employee benefits to all employees.  Benefits include a medical insurance program that includes options for employee coverage, dependent children coverage, and full family coverage; a 401-k retirement program that provides 100% company matching funds on an employee’s first 2% of wage contributions and a total 50% company match on the first 6% of wage contributions; as well as company provided group-term life insurance benefits and long-term disability insurance.  Access to dental, vision, cancer, short-term disability and accident insurance is also provided.  All employees also participate in a profit-sharing style annual bonus program.  Certain employees in leadership roles or who hold senior management positions are also eligible to participate in the company’s long-term incentive programs which customarily include grants of options to purchase Premier common stock.  We periodically compare our salaries and benefits to peer groups to ensure our competitiveness.

We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization.  We are committed to developing our staff through required continuing education programs and the availability of specialty education within the banking industry.  Employee retention helps us operate efficiently and achieve one of our business objectives, which is being a low-cost provider.

The safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique challenge with regard to maintaining employee safety while continuing successful operations. Through teamwork and the adaptability of our management and staff, we were able to restructure our branch operations and supporting operations to maintain proper protocols outlined by national and local governments and health organizations.

Working within, and giving back to, the local community is the hallmark of a true community bank.  We encourage our employees and directors to volunteer their time to organizations that suit their interests.  We monitor these volunteer efforts and report them to our bank regulatory supervision agencies.

We believe our efforts are successful as we maintain a high retention rate, keeping staff members long-term.  More than 22% of our employees have been employed for 10 years or more and an additional 18% have been employed for 20 years or more.  Longevity of employment results in less time and resources required for training new staff.  We believe that our high retention rate not only preserves institutional knowledge but fosters greater teamwork/productivity, increased revenue, better customer service and overall employee satisfaction.   We further believe that our high retention rate also strengthens our values as a true community bank.

Our executive offices are located at 2883 5th Avenue, Huntington, West Virginia 25702, telephone number (304) 525-1600 (facsimile number (304) 525-9701).
