ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Organizational Structure
Our business was originally organized in February 2006. We added our parent holding company, GWG Holdings, Inc. (“GWG Holdings”), in March 2008, and in September 2014 we consummated an initial public offering of GWG Holdings’ common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market where the stock trades under the ticker symbol “GWGH.”
GWG Holdings conducts its life insurance secondary market business through a wholly-owned subsidiary, GWG Life, LLC (“GWG Life”), and GWG Life’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, GWG Life Trust, GWG DLP Funding IV, LLC (“DLP IV”), GWG DLP Funding V Holdings, LLC (“DLP V Holdings”), and GWG DLP Funding Holdings VI, LLC (“DLP VI Holdings”). DLP V Holdings is the sole member of GWG DLP Funding V, LLC (“DLP V”). DLP VI Holdings is the sole member of GWG DLP Funding VI, LLC (“DLP VI”). 
In addition, GWG Holdings has exposure to indirect interests in loans collateralized by cash flows from alternative assets. Such loans are made and held by certain of the operating subsidiaries of Ben LP. These loans are made to certain of the ExAlt Trusts, which are consolidated subsidiaries of Ben LP and thus, such loans are eliminated upon consolidation for financial reporting purposes. Ben LP’s general partner is Beneficient Management, L.L.C. (“Beneficient Management”). Prior to December 31, 2019, GWG Holdings’ investment in Beneficient was accounted for as an equity method investment. On December 31, 2019, as more fully described below, Beneficient became a consolidated subsidiary of GWG Holdings. As also described below, on August 13, 2021, GWG Holdings entered into a non-binding term sheet with Ben LP and Beneficient Company Holdings, L.P. (“BCH”), that outlines a series of transactions which, if completed, will result in, among other things, (i) GWG Holdings receiving certain proposed enhancements to its investments in Beneficient; (ii) GWG Holdings no longer having the right to appoint directors of the Board of Directors of Beneficient Management; and (iii) Beneficient no longer being a consolidated subsidiary of GWG Holdings. The term sheet is part of ongoing efforts by management and the Board of Directors of the Company to maximize the value of GWG Holdings’ and GWG Life’s investment in Beneficient.
GWG Holdings also has a financial interest in FOXO Technologies Inc. (“FOXO”, formerly FOXO BioScience LLC), which, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries FOXO Labs Inc. (“FOXO Labs”, formerly, Life Epigenetics Inc.) and FOXO Life LLC (“FOXO Life”, formerly, youSurance General Agency, LLC), seeks to commercialize epigenetic technology for the longevity industry and offer life insurance directly to customers utilizing epigenetic technology. Although we have a financial interest in FOXO, we do not have a controlling financial interest because another party is the majority shareholder of the voting class of securities. Therefore, we account for our ownership interest in FOXO as an equity method investment. FOXO Labs was formed to commercialize epigenetic technology for the longevity industry. FOXO Life seeks to offer life insurance directly to customers utilizing epigenetic technology.
All of the aforementioned entities are legally organized in the state of Delaware, other than GWG Life Trust, which was formed under the laws of the state of Utah, and certain of the ExAlt Trusts, which were formed under the laws of the State of Texas. Unless the context otherwise requires or we specifically so indicate, all references in this report to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company,” “GWG,” or the “Company” refer to GWG Holdings together, in each case, with its subsidiaries. Our headquarters are located at 325 N. St. Paul Street, Suite 2560, Dallas, Texas 75201.
Our Company
We are an innovative financial services company that is a leader in providing unique liquidity solutions and services for the owners of illiquid investments. In 2018 and 2019, GWG Holdings consummated a series of transactions (as more fully described below) with Beneficient that has resulted in a significant reorientation of our business and capital allocation strategy towards an expansive and diverse exposure to alternative assets. As part of this reorientation, GWG Holdings also changed its Board of Directors and executive management team.
While we are continuing our work to maximize the value of our secondary life insurance business, based on recent developments in the capital markets, including the availability of financing on favorable terms, we have begun exploring the feasibility of purchasing additional life insurance policies through the secondary market and establishing a life insurance subsidiary to operate in the life insurance industry. These operations are in addition to allocating capital to provide liquidity to holders of a broader range of alternative assets, which GWG Holdings currently provides through investments in Beneficient.
Page 1


We completed the transactions with Beneficient to provide the Company with a significant increase in assets and common stockholders’ equity as well as with the opportunity for a diversified source of future earnings from our exposure to the alternative asset industry. We believe the Beneficient transactions and the other strategies we are pursuing, including continuing to pursue opportunities in the life insurance industry, will transform GWG Holdings from a niche provider of liquidity to owners of life insurance to a diversified provider of financial products and services with exposure to a broad range of alternative assets.
Beneficient is a financial services company based in Dallas, Texas, that markets an array of liquidity and trust administration products to alternative asset investors primarily comprised of mid-to-high-net-worth individuals having a net worth between $5 million and $30 million (“MHNW”) and small-to-midsize institutional investors and family offices with less than $1 billion in investable assets (“STMIs”). One of Beneficient’s founders, Brad K. Heppner (“Ben Founder”), serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Beneficient and previously served as Chairman of GWG Holdings from April 26, 2019 to June 14, 2021. Ben LP plans to offer its products and services through its five operating subsidiaries, which include (i) Ben Liquidity, (ii) Ben Custody Admin, (iii) Ben Insurance, (iv) Ben Markets and (v) Beneficient USA (each operating subsidiary is further defined below). Ben Liquidity plans to operate a trust company that is a Kansas Technology Enabled Fiduciary Financial Institutions (“TEFFI”) authorized to serve as an alternative asset custodian, trustee and lender with statutory powers granted for each of these activities and permitting Ben Liquidity to provide fiduciary financing for certain of its customer liquidity transactions. Ben Custody Admin plans to operate a Texas trust company that is being organized to provide its customers with certain administrative, custodial and trustee products and specialized services focused on alternative asset investors. Ben Insurance has been chartered as a Bermuda based insurance company that plans to offer certain customized insurance products and services covering risks relating to owning, managing and transferring alternative assets. Ben Markets is in the regulatory process for acquiring a captive registered broker-dealer that would conduct certain of its activities attendant to offering a suite of products and services from the Beneficient family of companies. Certain of Ben LP’s operating subsidiary products and services involve or are offered to certain of the ExAlt Trusts (defined below), which are consolidated subsidiaries of Ben LP for financial reporting purposes (such trusts are and may individually be referred to as Custody Trusts, Collective Trusts, LiquidTrusts, and Funding Trusts). Beneficient USA employs a substantial majority of the executives and staff for Beneficient’s operating subsidiaries to which Beneficient USA provides administrative and technical services.
Beneficient’s primary operations, which commenced on September 1, 2017, consist of offering its liquidity and trust administration services to its customers, primarily through certain of Ben LP’s operating subsidiaries, Ben Liquidity, L.L.C. (“Ben Liquidity”) and Ben Custody, L.L.C. (“Ben Custody Admin”), respectively. Ben Liquidity offers simple, rapid and cost-effective liquidity products to its customers through the use of customized trust vehicles, (such trusts, the “ExAlt Trusts”), that facilitate the exchange of a customer’s alternative assets for consideration using a unique financing structure (such structure and process, the “ExAlt PlanTM”). The ExAlt Plan trademark was developed by Beneficient as a brand of liquidity and trust administration services designed for alternative asset investors, specifically MHNW and STMIs to “Ex”it “Alt”ernatives. A subsidiary of Ben Liquidity makes loans (each, an “ExAlt Loan”) to certain of the ExAlt Trusts which employ the loan proceeds to acquire agreed upon consideration, which certain of the ExAlt Trusts deliver to customers in exchange for their alternative assets. Ben Liquidity generates interest and fee income earned in connection with the ExAlt Loans, which are collateralized by a portion of the cash flows from the exchanged alternative assets (the “Collateral”). Ben Custody Admin currently provides trust administration services to the trustees of certain of the ExAlt Trusts that own the exchanged alternative asset following liquidity transactions for fees payable quarterly. The Collateral supports the repayment of the ExAlt Loans plus any related interest and fees and trust administration service fees. Under the applicable trust and other agreements, certain charities are the ultimate beneficiaries of the ExAlt Trusts (the “Non-Controlling Interest Holders”). As ultimate beneficiaries of prior transactions, for every $0.95 paid to the lender (e.g., subsidiaries of Ben LP) on the ExAlt Loans, $0.05 is also paid to certain of the Non-Controlling Interest Holders. For periods following 2020, future Non-Controlling Interest Holders are structured to be paid $0.025 for every $0.975 paid to the fiduciary financial lender (e.g., subsidiaries of Ben LP) of the ExAlt Loans. Since Ben LP consolidates the ExAlt Trusts, Ben LP’s operating subsidiary’s ExAlt Loans and related interest and fee income are eliminated in the presentation of our consolidated financial statements.
Prior to January 1, 2021, Ben LP operated primarily through certain of its subsidiaries that included, (i) Beneficient Capital Company, L.L.C. (“BCC”), which offered liquidity products; (ii) Beneficient Administration and Clearing Company, L.L.C. (“BACC”), which provided services for private fund and trust administration; and (iii) other entities, including the ExAlt Trusts.
On December 31, 2020, a series of restructuring transactions occurred to better position certain of Ben LP’s subsidiaries for ongoing operations and future products and services, to capitalize Pen and to meet certain requirements of the Texas 
Page 2


Department of Banking. In connection with these transactions, BCC transferred all of its assets, which included, among other assets, its ExAlt Loans receivable, liabilities, which included, among other liabilities, loans payable with respect to secured loans with HCLP Nominees, L.L.C., held as of December 31, 2020, to BCH. In order to capitalize Pen and enable it to offer insurance products and services to cover risks attendant to owning and managing alternative assets following approval from the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the “BMA”), BCH contributed to Pen certain of such ExAlt Loans receivable with an aggregate carrying value equal to $129.2 million. Likewise, BACC transferred all of its assets, which included its rights to perform fund trust administration services under certain trust and other agreements, and liabilities to BCH, which will perform such services until a Texas trust company charter is issued or the Kansas TEFFI trust company becomes operational.
Subsequent to December 31, 2020, Ben LP operates primarily through its business line operating subsidiaries, which provide, or will provide, Beneficient’s existing and planned products and services. These subsidiaries include (i) Ben Liquidity, which offers liquidity products; (ii) Ben Custody Admin, which provides services for fund and trust administration; (iii) Ben Insurance L.L.C., including its subsidiaries (“Ben Insurance”), which intends to offer insurance products and services covering risks attendant to owning, managing and transferring alternative assets; (iv) Ben Markets, L.L.C., including its subsidiaries (“Ben Markets”), which intends to provide broker-dealer services in connection with offering Beneficient’s liquidity products and services; and (vi) other entities, including the ExAlt Trusts, which operate for the benefit of the Non-Controlling Interest Holder. Beneficient’s financial products and services are presently offered through Ben Liquidity and Ben Custody Admin, and Beneficient plans to expand its capabilities under Ben Custody Admin and provide products and services through Ben Insurance and Ben Markets in the future. 
Beneficient’s existing and planned products and services are designed to provide liquidity and trust solutions, support the tax and estate planning objectives of its MHNW customers, facilitate asset diversification or provide administrative management and reporting solutions tailored to the goals of investors of alternative investments.
Following several enhancements to its business practices, on March 6, 2020, Beneficient submitted updated trust company charter applications for two trust companies (one for liquidity products and the other for custodian and trustee services) to the Texas Department of Banking. On November 25, 2020, Beneficient withdrew one of its Texas charter applications. 
In April 2021, the Kansas Legislature adopted, and the governor of Kansas signed into law, a bill that would allow for the chartering and creation of Kansas trust companies, known as TEFFIs, that provide fiduciary financing (e.g., lending to the Exalt Trusts), custodian and trustee services in all capacities pursuant to statutory fiduciary powers, to investors and other participants in the alternative assets market, as well as the establishment of alternative asset trusts. The legislation became effective on July 1, 2021, and designates an operating subsidiary of Ben LP, Beneficient Fiduciary Financial, L.L.C. (“BFF”), as the pilot trust company under the TEFFI legislation. A conditional trust charter was issued by the Kansas Bank Commissioner to BFF on July 1, 2021. Under the pilot program, Beneficient will not be authorized to exercise its fiduciary powers as a TEFFI until the earlier of the date the Kansas Bank Commissioner promulgates applicable rules and regulations or December 31, 2021. The bill also permits the Kansas Bank Commissioner to request a six-month extension of the pilot program period, which could delay Beneficient’s permission to exercise fiduciary powers under the charter until July 1, 2022. In order to devote their time to serving as directors of the Beneficient TEFFI trust company, the directors of GWG Holdings who serve on the new TEFFI trust company Board of Directors resigned their membership, effective June 14, 2021, on GWG Holdings’ Board of Directors, which the Company believes is the highest and best use of their available time and skills and will support the development of the Beneficient TEFFI trust company and the successful execution of Beneficient’s business plan.
Additionally, Beneficient’s charter application for custodian and trustee services remains in process at the Texas Department of Banking. If the charter is issued, the trust company would serve as custodian and trustee to one or more of the ExAlt Trusts. Similar or the same services may also be provided by Beneficient’s Kansas trust company TEFFI. Also, a subsidiary of Ben Insurance, PEN Indemnity Insurance Company, Ltd. (“Pen”), has applied for regulatory approval from the BMA to write fiduciary liability policies for managers and investors in alternative asset funds to cover losses from contractual indemnification and exculpation provisions arising under the governing documents of such funds. Further, on March 26, 2021, a Ben LP subsidiary, Beneficient Capital Markets, L.L.C (“Beneficient Capital Markets”) filed a Form BD with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to commence its application for broker-dealer registration. Upon registration and admittance as a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) member, Beneficient Capital Markets will conduct its activities attendant to offering Beneficient’s products and services. 
When the Kansas TEFFI trust company is authorized to exercise its fiduciary powers, Beneficient expects to be able to expand its operations and close an increased number of liquidity transactions. Additionally, once BMA regulatory approval is 
Page 3


obtained and Beneficient Capital Markets is admitted as a FINRA member, Beneficient anticipates being able to offer its full suite of Beneficient’s Current and Future Products and Services.
The Beneficient Transactions
The Exchange Transaction
On December 28, 2018 (the “Final Closing Date”), we completed a series of strategic exchanges of assets among GWG Holdings, GWG Life, Ben LP and certain trusts, each identified as an Exchange Trust formed during 2017 and 2018 (such trusts collectively, the “Seller Trusts”, which are a related party but not among Ben LP’s consolidated trusts), pursuant to a Master Exchange Agreement among the parties (the “Exchange Transaction”). As a result of the Exchange Transaction, a number of securities were exchanged between the parties, including the following securities as of the Final Closing Date: the Seller Trusts acquired GWG L Bonds due 2023 (the “Seller Trust L Bonds”) in the aggregate principal amount of $366.9 million; the Seller Trusts acquired 27,013,516 shares of GWG Holdings’ common stock; GWG Holdings acquired 40,505,279 common units of Ben LP (the “Common Units”); and GWG Holdings acquired the right to obtain additional Common Units or other property that would be received by a holder of Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Accounts of BCH pursuant to an option issued by Ben LP (the “Option Agreement”). In addition, in connection with the Exchange Transaction, Ben LP, as borrower, entered into a commercial loan agreement (the “Commercial Loan Agreement”) with GWG Life, as lender, providing for a loan in a principal amount of $192.5 million as of the Final Closing Date (the “Commercial Loan”).
The Investment and Exchange Agreements
On December 31, 2019, GWG Holdings obtained control over Ben LP pursuant to a Preferred Series A Unit Account and Common Unit Investment Agreement by and among GWG Holdings, Ben LP, BCH, and Beneficient Management (the “Investment Agreement”), which resulted in the consolidation of GWG Holdings and Ben LP for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, GWG Holdings transferred $79.0 million to Ben LP in return for 666,667 Common Units and a Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Account of BCH.
In connection with the Investment Agreement, GWG Holdings obtained the right to appoint a majority of the board of directors of Beneficient Management, the general partner of Ben LP. As a result, GWG Holdings obtained control of Ben LP and began reporting the results of Ben LP and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis beginning on the transaction date of December 31, 2019. GWG Holdings’ right to appoint a majority of the Board of Directors of Beneficient Management will terminate in the event (i) GWG Holdings’ ownership of the fully diluted equity of Ben LP (excluding equity issued upon the conversion or exchange of Preferred Series A Unit Accounts of BCH held as of December 31, 2019 by parties other than GWG Holdings) is less than 25%, (ii) the Continuing Directors of GWG Holdings cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of GWG Holdings, or (iii) certain bankruptcy events occur with respect to GWG Holdings. The term “Continuing Directors” means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors of GWG Holdings who: (1) was a member of the Board of Directors of GWG Holdings on December 31, 2019; or (2) was nominated for election or elected to the Board of Directors of GWG Holdings with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of the Board of Directors of GWG Holdings at the time of such nomination or election.
Following the transaction, and as agreed upon in the Investment Agreement, GWG Holdings was issued an initial capital account balance for the Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Account of $319.0 million. The other holders of the Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Accounts are an entity related to Beneficient’s initial investors (the “Ben Initial Investors”) and an entity related to one of Beneficient’s directors who is also a former director of GWG Holdings (the “Related Account Holders”). The parties to the Investment Agreement agreed that the aggregate capital accounts of all holders of the Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Accounts after giving effect to the investment by GWG Holdings is $1.6 billion. GWG Holdings’ Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Account is the same class of preferred security as held by the Related Account Holders. In the event the Related Account Holders exchange their Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Account for securities of GWG Holdings, the Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Account of GWG Holdings would be converted into Common Units (so neither GWG Holdings nor the founders would hold Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Accounts).
Also, on December 31, 2019, in a transaction related to the Investment Agreement, GWG Holdings transferred its interest in the Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Account to its wholly owned subsidiary, GWG Life.
Page 4


In addition, on December 31, 2019, GWG Holdings, Ben LP and the holders of Common Units entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) pursuant to which the holders of Common Units from time to time have the right, on a quarterly basis, to exchange their Common Units for common stock of GWG Holdings. The exchange ratio in the Exchange Agreement is based on the ratio of the capital account associated with the Common Units to be exchanged to the market price of GWG Holdings’ common stock based on the volume weighted average price of GWG Holdings’ common stock for the five consecutive trading days prior to the quarterly exchange date. The Exchange Agreement is intended to facilitate the marketing of Ben LP’s products to holders of alternative assets.
Preferred Series C Unit Purchase Agreement
On July 15, 2020, GWG Holdings entered into a Preferred Series C Unit Purchase Agreement (“UPA”) with Ben LP and BCH. The UPA was reviewed and approved by the then constituted Special Committee of the Board of Directors of GWG Holdings.
Pursuant to the UPA, and provided it has adequate liquidity, GWG Holdings has agreed to make capital contributions from time to time to BCH in exchange for Preferred Series C Unit Accounts of BCH during a purchasing period commencing on the date of the UPA and continuing until the earlier of (i) the occurrence of a Change of Control Event (as defined below) and (ii) the mutual agreement of the parties (the “Purchasing Period”). A “Change of Control Event” shall mean (A) the occurrence of an event that results in GWG Holdings’ ownership of the fully diluted equity of Ben LP is less than 25%, the Continuing Directors (as defined below) of GWG Holdings cease to constitute a majority of the board of directors of GWG Holdings, or certain bankruptcy events occur with respect to GWG Holdings, and (B) the listing of Common Units on a national securities exchange (a “Public Listing”). The term “Continuing Directors” means, as of any date of determination, any member of the board of directors of GWG Holdings who: (1) was a member of the Board of Directors of GWG Holdings on December 31, 2019; or (2) was nominated for election or elected to the Board of Directors of GWG Holdings with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of the Board of Directors of GWG Holdings at the time of such nomination or election.
If, on or prior to the end of the Purchasing Period, a Public Listing occurs, the BCH Purchased Units shall be automatically exchanged for Common Units, or another unit of Ben LP, as the parties may mutually agree (the “Beneficient Units”), at the lower of (i) the volume-weighted average of the Beneficient Units for the 20 trading days following the Public Listing, and (ii) $12.75.
In addition, at any time following the Effective Date, all or some of the Preferred Series C Unit Accounts purchased under the UPA may be exchanged for Beneficient Units at the option of GWG Holdings (exercised by a special committee of the Board of Directors or, if such committee is no longer in place, the appropriate governing body of the Company); provided that, if GWG Holdings exchanges less than all of the Preferred Series C Unit Accounts purchased under the UPA, then, immediately after giving effect to such exchange, GWG Holdings shall be required to continue to hold Preferred Series C Unit Accounts with a capital account that is at least $10.0 million. The exchange price for such Beneficient Units shall be determined by third-party valuation agents selected by GWG Holdings and Beneficient.
Contribution and Exchange Agreement
On September 30, 2020, certain of the ExAlt Trusts (collectively, the “Participating ExAlt Trusts”) at the sole direction of John A. Stahl, independent trustee of each such trust, with the intention of protecting the value of certain assets of the Participating ExAlt Trusts underlying part of the Collateral portfolio, the Participating ExAlt Trusts entered into that certain Contribution and Exchange Agreement with certain of the Seller Trusts, (collectively, the “Participating Exchange Trusts”), each of which entered into such agreement at the direction of its applicable trust advisor and by and through its applicable corporate trustee (the “Contribution and Exchange Agreement). Under the Contribution and Exchange Agreement, the Participating Exchange Trusts agreed to exchange 9,837,264 shares of GWG Holdings’ common stock valued at $84.6 million, 543,874 shares of Common Units valued at $6.8 million, and GWG Holdings’ L Bonds due 2023 in the aggregate principal amount of $94.8 million to the Participating ExAlt Trusts for $94.3 million in net asset value of the alternative asset investments held by the Participating ExAlt Trusts. This transaction (the “Collateral Swap”) resulted in GWG Holdings, after the effects of eliminations upon consolidation, recognizing an additional $42.9 million of treasury stock, $3.4 million of additional noncontrolling interest, and $46.8 million of a deemed capital contribution from a related party.
The Exchange Transaction, the Investment and Exchange Agreements, the UPA, and the Collateral Swap are referred to collectively as the “Beneficient Transactions.”

Term Sheet
On August 13, 2021, GWG Holdings entered into a non-binding term sheet (the “Term Sheet”) with its non-wholly owned subsidiaries Ben LP and BCH that outlines a series of transactions which, if completed, will result in, among other things, (i) GWG Holdings receiving certain proposed enhancements to its investments in Beneficient; (ii) GWG Holdings no longer having the right to appoint directors of the Board of Directors of Beneficient Management; and (iii) Ben LP no longer being a consolidated subsidiary of GWG Holdings. The Term Sheet is a part of ongoing efforts by management and the Board of Directors of GWG Holdings to maximize the value of its investments in Beneficient. 
GWG Holdings believes that returning control of Beneficient is a necessary step for Ben LP to establish one of its operating subsidiaries as a TEFFI under the Kansas Technology-Enabled Fiduciary Financial Institutions Act (the “TEFFI Act”), which is important to Beneficient’s long-term business objective of providing liquidity and other services to holders of alternative assets. 
Until the definitive documentation is finalized and executed, each of the provisions of the Term Sheet is non-binding and is subject to change in all respects, including as a result of additional diligence, the further discharge of fiduciary duties, and the negotiation of definitive documentation. GWG Holdings has begun working on definitive documentation to implement the Term Sheet with Ben LP and is working to complete such definitive documentation during the fourth quarter of 2021, although there can be no assurance definitive documentation will be completed by then, or at all.
If Ben LP becomes an independent company pursuant to the terms of the Term Sheet, GWG Holdings expects that Ben LP would reduce its reliance on GWG Holdings to fund its operations and would raise future capital from other sources. Beneficient’s capital raising efforts may include the issuance of equity or debt of Ben LP or one of its subsidiaries, and the newly issued securities are expected to be dilutive to GWG Holdings’ and GWG Life’s percentage ownership in Ben LP and BCH and may include preferential terms relative to GWG Holdings’ and GWG Life’s investments in Ben LP and BCH, as applicable. GWG Holdings would still retain a substantial investment in Beneficient.
Segment Financial Information
We have two reportable segments: 1) Secondary Life Insurance and 2) Beneficient.
GWG Holdings’ segment information is included in Note 16, Segment Reporting, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 2020 Form 10-K.
Market Opportunity
Alternative Asset Liquidity Products and Services
The market demand for liquidity from owners of alternative assets is generally correlated to the outstanding net asset value of illiquid alternative assets (“NAV”) held by U.S. investors. Using data from various published industry reports from 2017 to 2020, certain widely accepted commercial private-equity databases, and applying its own proprietary assumptions and calculations (“Ben Estimates”), Beneficient estimates that total outstanding NAV held by U.S. investors exceeded $5.8 trillion in 2019 (up from an estimated $5.3 trillion in 2018).
According to at least one industry report from Preqin, the leading provider of data on alternative assets, from 2020, total outstanding NAV in the hands of U.S. investors grew at a 17.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2017-2020, the highest CAGR of all investment classes.
According to Ben Estimates, the large U.S. institutions representing approximately 62% of the NAV have consistently sought liquidity on approximately 1.85% to 2.25% of their outstanding NAV on an annual basis. Based on Ben Estimates, this has led to an annual demand for liquidity of nearly $55.0 billion in recent years.
A primary group not included in this demand is the MHNW investor who holds investments of $5 million to $30 million compared to a large institution’s holdings in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Intermediary brokers will often not represent the MHNW individuals (or STM institutional investors). Of the $5.8 trillion of investments in alternative assets, approximately $785.0 billion were held by MHNW investors, and over $890.0 billion were held in the portfolios of STM investors, both segments of investors who we believe have little to no access to the highly competitive large institutional 
Page 6


market for alternative asset liquidity, as reported by Preqin, Setter Capital and Ben Estimates. According to Ben Estimates, MHNW investors have only been able to access liquidity representing less than 0.5% of the NAV held by them each year, compared to the average 2% annually achieved by the large institutional owners, representing 62% of the market.
Based on these amounts, Beneficient estimates that MHNW investors would seek liquidity of at least 3% of their outstanding NAV each year if liquidity was made available to them, or a slightly greater percentage than that of large U.S. institutions. As a result, and according to Ben Estimates, the estimated market demand for liquidity by MHNW individuals would have exceeded $23.0 billion in 2020.
In addition to providing liquidity to owners of alternative assets, Beneficient, through Ben Custody Admin, seeks to address the administrative and regulatory burden of holding alternative assets by offering bespoke administrative support services to trustees and custodians. While Beneficient’s conditional Kansas TEFFI charter, once operational, would allow Beneficient to provide custodial and trustee services, Beneficient has also submitted a trust company charter to the Texas Department of Banking to conduct custodial and trustee services in the future. Upon issuance of a trust company charter from Kansas or Texas, Beneficient intends to expand its services to provide its customers and others with comprehensive qualified custodial, trustee, accounting, tax, compliance, reporting and other back-office administrative services for their alternative assets. Ben Custody Admin’s trust administrative support services to trustees and custodians are currently only offered to certain of the ExAlt Trusts, which are consolidated subsidiaries of Beneficient.
Primary Life Insurance Market and Technology (“insurtech”)
The opportunity to apply technology to transform the insurance industry is significant. The application of technology to the insurance industry, commonly referred to as “insurtech”, provides opportunities for new entrants into the traditional insurance marketplace that have the potential to significantly disrupt the insurance industry’s historical approach to assessing and selecting acceptable underwriting risks. GWG Holdings’ involvement in the insurtech space is limited to its investments in FOXO, as discussed in the Organizational Structure section above. GWG Holdings has contributed $16.2 million in cash to FOXO to date through December 31, 2020, and is committed to contribute an additional $3.8 million to the entity through October 2021, all of which was contributed by such date.
Business Strategies
1. Liquidity for Alternative Assets
As a result of the Beneficient Transactions, we are now uniquely positioned to provide liquidity and related services to investors holding a full range of illiquid alternative assets. We will continue to work to create the most value for holders of alternative assets, the financial professionals who advise them, and for our shareholders.
Beneficient provides private trust solutions, including a unique suite of lending and liquidity products focused on bringing liquidity to owners of alternative assets. Beneficient’s innovative liquidity solutions are designed to serve MHNW individuals, STM institutions, and asset managers who have historically possessed few attractive options to access early liquidity from their alternative assets. Beneficient targets MHNW individual customers with $5 million to $30 million in investments and institutional customers typically holding less than $1 billion in assets.
Beneficient’s products can also support tax and estate planning objectives, facilitate a diversification of assets or provide administrative management and reporting solutions tailored to the goals of the investor. 
Our life insurance secondary market business is designed to serve consumers 65 years or older who own life insurance policies. We seek to earn non-correlated yield from life insurance policies that we purchased and may purchase in the secondary market. Since inception, we have purchased over $3.2 billion in face value of policy benefits from consumers for over $620 million, as compared to the $52 million in surrender value offered by insurance carriers on those same policies. Our products provide unique and valuable services to the senior consumers whom we serve.
The goal of our secondary life insurance business has been to build a profitable, large and well-diversified portfolio of life insurance assets. We have not made additional investments in the life settlements portfolio since 2018. However, because of the changes in the capital markets landscape, including the availability of favorable financing terms, we have begun exploring the feasibility of additional future investments in the life settlement portfolio as well as the form such investments might take.
Page 7


2. Insurance Products and Services
Through Ben Insurance, Beneficient intends to offer customized insurance services covering risks attendant to owning, managing, and transferring alternative assets. These services would provide tailored solutions to customers that enable them to mitigate many of the risks associated with alternative asset ownership, management and divestment. We are also exploring opportunities to provide life insurance products related to our life insurance business. 
3. Developing a World Class Financial Services Distribution Platform
GWG Holdings has developed a large and sophisticated financial services product distribution platform. Today, this platform consists of approximately 145 independent broker-dealers and almost five thousand independent financial advisors (“Retail Distribution”) who sell the Company’s investment products. “Independent” in this context refers to broker-dealers that accommodate financial advisors who carry securities licenses and need back-office support for services, such as compliance and trade execution, but allow their advisors wide latitude in how they conduct business. Since inception, GWG Holdings has raised approximately $2.6 billion of debt and equity capital, including renewals but excluding Seller Trust L Bonds, to support our business activities.

We believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our Retail Distribution for several reasons:
•Newly independent financial professionals and their clients demand a high level of customer service and access to innovative and value added products;
•The significant demand for liquidity from owners of alternative assets by US investors;
•GWG Holdings’ relationship with Beneficient will attract more and larger broker dealers to our platform due to our increased size and market capitalization as well as the increase in products offered; and
•By using capital to provide liquidity products to our current customers, and as they begin to realize the benefit of these products, we will able to raise more capital and attract additional broker dealers into our selling group. 
Competitive and Regulatory Framework
Competition
We encounter significant competition from numerous companies in the products and services we provide and seek to develop in the alternative assets industry. Many of these competitors may have greater resources and significantly lower cost of funds than we do because, for example, they have access to insured deposits or greater access to the capital markets. They may also have greater market share in the markets in which we operate. These factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to implement our growth strategies.
In addition, as we enter new markets, we expect to experience significant competition from incumbent market participants. Our ability to compete in these markets will depend on our ability to deliver value-added products and services to the customers we serve. These factors could also adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to implement our growth strategies.
Government Regulation
Our life insurance secondary market business is highly regulated at the state level. We hold a license to purchase life insurance policies in one state and can also purchase in seven unregulated states. We have also historically purchased life insurance policies from other secondary market participants. States generally subject us to laws and regulations requiring us to obtain specific licenses or approvals to purchase life insurance policies in those states. State statutes typically provide state regulatory agencies with significant powers to interpret, administer and enforce the laws relating to the life insurance industry. Under this authority, state regulators have broad discretionary power and may impose new licensing and other requirements, and interpret or enforce existing regulatory requirements in new and different ways. Any of these new requirements, interpretations or enforcement directives could be materially adverse to our industry. 
Although the federal securities laws and regulations do not directly affect life insurance, in some cases the purchase of a variable life insurance policy may constitute a transaction involving a “security” that is governed by federal securities laws. While we presently hold few variable life insurance policies, our holding of a significant amount of such policies in the future could cause our Company or one of our subsidiaries to be characterized as an “investment company” under the federal 
Page 8


Investment Company Act of 1940. The application of that law to all or part of our businesses — whether due to our purchase of life insurance policies, GWG Holdings’ and GWG Life’s investments in Beneficient, or to the expansion of the definition of “securities” under federal securities laws — could require us to comply with detailed and complex regulatory requirements, and cause us to fall out of compliance with certain covenants under the second amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation (as amended from time to time, “LNV Credit Facility”), the credit facility (the “NF Credit Facility”) with National Founders, L.P. (“National Founders”), the credit agreements governing Beneficient’s secured loans from HCLP Nominees, L.L.C., and the Pledge and Security Agreement in favor of the holders of the L Bonds of GWG Holdings. Such an outcome could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to implement our growth strategies.
Beneficient has applied for a trust company charter from the Texas Department of Banking, received a conditional Kansas TEFFI charter from the Kansas Office of the State Bank Commissioner, and intends to carry on a significant portion its business through its subsidiary, BFF, as a Kansas TEFFI. Because Beneficient’s current business plans are based in part on obtaining the unconditional Kansas TEFFI charter to operate as regulated Kansas TEFFI, a failure to obtain such unconditional Kansas TEFFI charter may materially and adversely impact its financial performance and prospects, which would likely diminish our ability to effect certain parts of our business plan and growth strategies. Furthermore, a failure to obtain the unconditional Kansas TEFFI charter may trigger an impairment assessment related to the assets of Beneficient, including goodwill recognized in connection with the Investment and Exchange Agreements (see Note 4 to our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further details of the accounting for the change in control). Additionally, in connection with the receipt of a Kansas TEFFI charter, BFF will become subject to further regulation by the Kansas Office of the State Bank Commissioner, including new rules and regulations that it will be expected to adopt as a part of and following the TEFFI pilot program. Such regulations could prove to be burdensome on Beneficient’s business and could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, Beneficient has applied for regulatory approval to commence offering insurance policies through its Ben Insurance subsidiary, Pen, in Bermuda as a Class 3 insurer. Bermuda insurance statutes and regulations, and the policies of the BMA, require that Pen, among other things, maintain a minimum level of capital and surplus, satisfy solvency standards, restrict dividends and distributions, obtain prior approval or provide notification to the BMA of certain transactions, maintain a head office in Bermuda, have a representative, secretary or a director resident in Bermuda, appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda and provide for the performance of certain periodic examinations of itself and its financial conditions. A failure to meet these conditions may result in the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals or, if obtained, a suspension or revocation of Pen’s authority to do business as an insurance company in Bermuda, which would mean that Pen would not be able to provide the planned insurance products until the approvals are obtained or any suspension or revocation of the required approvals is resolved. 
The state regulatory landscape for the use of genetic and epigenetic testing in life insurance underwriting is such that genetic and epigenetic testing is generally permitted. A few states require informed consent for use of genetic testing in life insurance underwriting. Epigenetic testing is distinguishable from genetic testing and we believe epigenetic testing does not raise the ethical issue found with genetic testing of denying insurance coverage to applicants based on immutable inherited characteristics. While well-informed policymakers and regulators should have little reason to consider expanding current definitions of genetic testing to include epigenetic testing, or to increase restrictions on life insurance underwriting using epigenetic test results, we can provide no such assurances.
Other changes to the current genetic and epigenetic regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any time during the development or marketing of FOXO’s epigenetic based products. This may negatively affect the ability of FOXO to obtain or maintain applicable regulatory clearance or approval of its products. In addition, regulatory authorities, such as the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), may introduce new requirements that may change the regulatory requirements for FOXO or its customers, or both.
On March 26, 2021, Beneficient Capital Markets filed a Form BD with the SEC to commence its application for broker-dealer registration. If and when Beneficient Capital Markets is registered and admitted as a FINRA member, it will become subject to the various rules and regulations governing broker-dealers.
Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated by the SEC to self-regulatory organizations such as FINRA. FINRA adopts rules (which are subject to approval by the SEC) for governing its members and the industry. Broker-dealers are also subject to federal securities laws and SEC rules, as well as the laws and rules of the states in which a broker-dealer conducts business. The laws and regulations to which broker-dealers are subject cover all aspects of its securities business, including, but not limited to, sales and trading practices, net capital requirements, record keeping and reporting procedures, 
Page 9


relationships and conflicts with customers, restrictions on new business lines without regulatory approval, restrictions on cash withdrawals and distributions, investment banking activities, experience and training requirements for certain employees, and the conduct and supervision of registered persons, officers and employees. Broker-dealers are also subject to privacy, disaster recovery and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. 
The principal purpose of regulation, oversight and discipline of broker-dealers is the protection of customers and the securities markets rather than protection of creditors and stockholders of broker-dealers. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by the SEC, securities exchanges, self-regulatory organizations such as FINRA or states, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of broker-dealers. These governmental and self-regulatory organizations may conduct routine examinations, for-cause examinations, investigations and administrative and enforcement proceedings that can result in censure, fine, profit disgorgement, monetary penalties, suspension, revocation of registration or expulsion of broker-dealers, their registered persons, officers or employees.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
HIPAA requires that holders of medical records maintain such records and implement procedures designed to assure the privacy of patient records. In order to carry out our secondary life insurance business, we receive medical records and obtain a release to share such records with a defined group of persons, take on the responsibility for preserving the privacy of that information, and use the information only for purposes related to the life insurance policies we own.
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA)
GINA is a federal law that protects people from genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment. GINA prohibits health insurers from: (i) requesting, requiring, or using genetic information to make decisions about eligibility for health insurance; or (ii) making decisions on the health insurance premiums, contribution amounts, or coverage terms they offer to consumers. In addition, GINA makes it against the law for health insurers to consider family history or a genetic test result, a preexisting condition, require a genetic test, or use any genetic information, to discriminate coverage, even if the health insurance company did not mean to collect such genetic information.
GINA does not apply to the life insurance, long-term care or annuity industries. The life insurance, long-term care or annuity industries operate on medical-evidenced underwriting principles in which specific medical conditions are taken into account when assessing and pricing risk. The regulation of genomic data is relatively new, and we believe it is likely that regulation will increase and grow more complex in the foreseeable future. We cannot, however, predict what any new law or regulation would specifically involve or how it might affect our industry, our business, or our future plans.
