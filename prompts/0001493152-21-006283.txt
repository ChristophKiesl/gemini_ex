Item 1. Description of Business.
Overview
 
Subsequent to the termination of our Delivery Service Provider Agreement with Amazon Logistics, Inc, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”), on September 30, 2020, as discussed below, we focus primarily on the transportation of packages, on pallets, which, through Shypdirect, we pick up at an Amazon distribution center or other locations, in box trucks, for a single customer, Amazon, which are delivered to post offices or, less frequently, to another distribution center. This is our box-truck or “mid-mile business.” For the same customer, Amazon, we also pick up packages, on pallets, in tractor trailers, from on-line retailers who market through Amazon, and deliver those packages to Amazon for sale to the public (our tractor-trailer or “long-haul” business). Amazon is the largest E-commerce retailer in the United States.
 
Through our subsidiary, Shypdirect LLC (“Shypdirect”), we also do a limited amount of last-mile delivery (our minivan or “last mile” business) for a different customer.
 
Subsequent to the termination of our Delivery Service Provider Agreement with Amazon on September 30, 2020, as discussed below, our mid-mile business currently accounts for approximately 80% of our revenues and our long-haul business accounts for approximately 18-19% of our revenues. These percentages will fall slightly, if we are able to grow our last-mile business.
 
Historically, approximately 58% to 65% of our business consisted of last-mile services — transporting goods from a manufacturer or fulfillment center to a delivery station, from a fulfillment center to a post office, or from the delivery station to an end user or retail customer. We conducted that business through Prime EFS, a company which is currently not generating revenues or conducting new business. Today, as noted, last-mile accounts for not more than 1-2% of our monthly revenues.
 
At present, we are providing tractor-trailer and box truck deliveries of packages on the east coast of the United States, primarily in and from New Jersey, Georgia, Florida, Ohio and Tennessee, primarily for Amazon and its customers, and for other customers.
 
We also offer a number of logistics services to Amazon and storage solutions for Amazon’s customers with limited storage facilities, in order to help manage such customer’s goods efficiently.
 
We are primarily an asset-based point-to-point delivery company. An asset-based delivery company, as compared to a non-asset-based delivery company, owns or leases its own transportation equipment. We employ our own drivers and use the services of independent contractors who may use their own vehicles.
 
Between June 18, 2018 and September 30, 2020, we operated through two New Jersey-based subsidiaries. Those subsidiaries were Prime EFS, LLC, which conducted the last-mile business focused on deliveries to the retail consumer for our primary customer in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania (“Prime EFS”), and Shypdirect, which formed in July 2018 and focused on, and which is still conducting, our long-haul and mid-mile delivery businesses.
 
The great bulk of Prime EFS’s business prior to September 30, 2020 was conducted pursuant to the Delivery Service Provider program (the “Prime EFS DSP Program”) of Amazon Logistics, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”). Shypdirect conducts its business as a carrier under a relay program service agreement with Amazon Logistics, Inc., last amended on August 24, 2020 (the “Amazon Relay Carrier Terms of Service Agreement”). Under that agreement, Shypdirect provides transportation services, including receiving, loading, storing, transporting, delivering, unloading and related services for Amazon and its customers, with such contract currently set to expire on May 14, 2021.
 
Revenues under the Prime EFS DSP Program agreement were approximately 54.0% and 67.8% of total revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenues for Shypdirect under the Amazon Relay Carrier Terms of Service Agreement were approximately 42.7% and 30.9% of total revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenues under the Prime EFS DSP Program for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $13,944,991, or approximately 54.0% of total Company revenues. Revenues for Shypdirect under the Amazon Relay Carrier Terms of Service Agreement were $11,027,594, or approximately 42.7% of total Company revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.
 
In June 2020, Amazon gave notice to Prime EFS that Amazon would not be renewing Prime EFS’s DSP Program agreement when that agreement terminated effective September 30, 2020. Amazon made clear to Prime EFS that Amazon’s decision not to renew the DSP agreement was part of a well-publicized initiative by Amazon to restructure how it would be delivering its last-mile services, and did not reflect the quality of the services provided by Prime EFS.
 
As a result of the termination of Prime EFS’s involvement with Amazon’s DSP Program, on or about October 20, 2020, Prime EFS gave notice to its vendors and other creditors that Prime had ceased business operations effective September 30, 2020. As a result of this action, effective October 1, 2020, and unless and until the Company, whether by acquisition or otherwise, augments its current business and/or enters into new line(s) of business, the Company’s Shypdirect subsidiary will be the major source of Company revenues through May 14, 2021, the date that the Amazon Relay Carrier Terms of Service is currently set to expire. For last five (5) reported fiscal quarters, those revenues have been as follows: quarter ended December 31, 2020 - $1,851,825, quarter ended September 30, 2020 - $2,400,597, quarter ended June 30, 2020 - $3,209,314, quarter ended March 31, 2020 - $3,565,858 and quarter ended December 31, 2019 - $3,435,317.
 
At present, the overwhelming source of Shypdirect’s revenues is as a carrier under the Amazon Relay Carrier Terms of Service. Under that agreement, Shypdirect provides transportation services, including receiving, loading, storing, transporting, delivering, unloading and related services, for Amazon and its customers.
 
At present, Shypdirect primarily serves Amazon distribution centers located in the following five (5) cities: Carteret, New Jersey (serving the Tri-State area); Jacksonville, Florida; Jefferson, Georgia; Cleveland, Ohio; and Nashville, Tennessee. Each of the last four (4) distribution centers mentioned serves a perimeter of approximately three (3) hours’ one-way drive time.

While Shypdirect is attempting the grow its business in these other markets, there can be no assurance that Shypdirect will be successful in doing so.
 
Although Amazon extended the term of the Amazon Relay Carrier Terms of Service in 2020, at present, the contract expires May 14, 2021. While the Company may extend the term of the Amazon Relay Carrier Terms of Service beyond May 14, 2021, there can be no assurance that Shypdirect will, in fact, seek to do so or if it does so, that it will be successful in doing so.
 
On November 13, 2020, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Shyp FX, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey (“Shyp FX”). On January 15, 2021, through Shyp FX, we simultaneously executed an asset purchase agreement (“APA”) and closed a transaction to acquire substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Double D Trucking, Inc., a northern New Jersey-based logistics provider specializing in servicing Federal Express over the past 25 years (“DDTI”). The purchase price is $100,000 of cash and a promissory note of $400,000. The principal assets involved in the acquisition are vehicles for cargo transport, system equipment for vehicle tracking and navigation of vehicles, and delivery route rights together with assumption of associated customer relationships.
 
The Company has a highly experienced and dedicated senior management team, which, with the assistance of a highly experienced restructuring consultant, is currently evaluating various opportunities, whether by acquisition or otherwise, for the Company to augment its current business and/or enter into new line(s) of business. While the Company is hopeful that it will be able to announce a plan in this regard shortly, there can be no assurance that the Company will in fact be able to augment its current business and/or enter into new line(s) of business or to do so profitably.
 
As of December 31, 2019, we owned or leased an aggregate of approximately 256 trucks or delivery vehicles and employed 588 drivers, who worked in shifts that allowed us to utilize most of our transportation equipment on a 24/7 basis. We also utilized the services of independent contractors to provide our delivery services. As of December 31, 2019, 47 independent contractors provided services to us on a full-time basis.
 
With the termination of Prime EFS’s last-mile delivery business effective which terminated on September 30, 2020, through Shypdirect, we employ approximately 50 drivers, who work in shifts that allow us to utilize most of our transportation equipment on a 24/7 basis. As of December 31, 2020, through Shypdirect, we owned or leased an aggregate approximately 18 vehicles – approximately 5 box trucks, 8 tractor-trailers and 5 vans. These vehicles are driven by our employees. At present, we are returning the box trucks to our lessor, Ryder. These box trucks are not included in the above transportation equipment totals.
 
We also continue to utilize the services of independent contractors to provide our delivery services. At present, with the termination of Prime EFS’s last-mile delivery business effective September 30, 2020, approximately 17 independent contractors, with access to approximately 50 of their own trucks, provide services to us on a full-time basis.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated under the name “PetroTerra Corp.” in the State of Nevada on July 25, 2008. Prior to March 2017, we were an independent oil or gas exploration and development company focused on the acquisition or lease of properties that potentially contained extractable oil or gas. However, at that time, we had not generated any revenues and, due to a decline of the oil and gas markets, elected to seek other business opportunities.
 
On March 30, 2017, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement, dated as of the same date, with Save on Transport Inc., a Florida-based non-asset provider of integrated transportation management solutions, including brokerage and logistics services related to the transportation of automobiles and other freight (“Save on Transport”), pursuant to which we acquired Save on Transport as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Our acquisition of Save on Transport was treated as a reverse merger and recapitalization of Save on Transport for financial reporting purposes because the Save on Transport shareholders retained an approximate 80% controlling interest in our consolidated company. Save on Transport was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes, and our historical financial statements before the acquisition transaction were replaced with the historical financial statements of Save on Transport before such acquisition. The balance sheets at their historical cost basis of both entities were combined at the acquisition date and the results of operations from the acquisition date forward included the historical results of Save on Transport and our combined results of operations from the acquisition date forward. On May 1, 2019, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Save On and Steven Yariv, whereby the Company returned all of the stock of Save On to Steven Yariv in exchange for Mr. Yariv conveying 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company back to the Company. Pursuant to Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 205-20-45, the financial statement in which net income or loss of a business entity is reported shall report the results of operations of the discontinued operation in the period in which a discontinued operation either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale. Accordingly, beginning in the second quarter of 2019, the period that Save On was disposed of, we reflect Save On as a discontinued operation and such presentation is retroactively applied to all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
On June 18, 2018, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Prime EFS from its members.
 
On July 24, 2018, we formed Shypdirect LLC, a company organized under the laws of New Jersey. Shypdirect is a transportation company with a focus on tractor trailer and box truck deliveries of product on the east coast of the United States from one distributor’s warehouse to another warehouse or from a distributor’s warehouse to the post office.
 
On November 13, 2020, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Shyp FX, Inc., under the laws of the State of New Jersey (“Shyp FX”).
 
On November 16, 2020, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, TLSS Acquisition, Inc., under the laws of the State of Delaware (“TLSS Acquisition”).
 
On February 21, 2021, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Shyp CX, Inc., under the laws of the State of New York (“Shyp CX”).
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, TLSS and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Prime EFS, Shypdirect, Shyp FX, TLSS Acquisition, and Shyp CX are hereafter referred to as the “Company”. Our principal executive offices are located in the United States at 5500 Military Trail, Suite 22-357, Jupiter, Florida 33458, and our telephone number is (833) 764-1443.

Company Overview
 
Prior to September 30, 2020, we generated our revenues through two subsidiaries, Prime EFS and Shypdirect. Effective October 1, 2020, we are generating our revenues through Shypdirect only.
 
For the period from January 1, 2018 to June 18, 2018, we operated in one reportable business segment consisting of brokerage and logistic services such as transportation scheduling, routing and other value-added services related to the transportation of automobiles and other freight.
 
From June 18, 2018 to May 1, 2019, we operated in two reportable business segments - (1) the transportation of automobiles and other freight (the “Save On” segment), and (2) a segment which concentrates on deliveries for online retailers in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and also concentrates on tractor trailer and box truck deliveries of product on the east coast of the United States from one distributor’s warehouse to another warehouse or from a distributor’s warehouse to the post office. On May 1, 2019, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Save On and Steven Yariv, whereby we returned all of the stock of Save On to Steven Yariv in exchange for Mr. Yariv conveying 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company back to the Company.
 
Prior to September 30, 2020, Prime EFS provided multiple services involving movement of goods through e-commerce. It focused primarily on the transportation of packages that are ultimately to be delivered to the business or retail consumer, with transportation services going from the manufacturer or fulfillment center to the delivery station and from the delivery station to the end user (known as “last mile” deliveries). We are currently looking to offer the expertise and knowledge we have in this area to customers other than Amazon.
 
Our current services are priced based on whether a route is a mid-mile route, served by a box truck, or a long-haul route, served by a tractor-trailer. Mid-mile services are priced either at a fixed rate or a variable rate, depending on length of route. All our long-haul business is fixed fee, based solely on where we pick up a trailer and where we drop it off, not on the time it takes for us to complete the delivery and return the trailer to our customer. The number of packages is not a factor in pricing either mid-mile or long-haul.
 
E-Commerce Fulfillment Solutions
 
The rapid growth of e-commerce and the online retailing segment of e-commerce is well documented. Online retail companies have logistics needs that differ from those of traditional businesses. Unlike traditional inventory management, e-commerce companies need to ship items directly to customers, who expect their orders to arrive on time and as described. We have built our delivery services to perform effectively in the “on demand” shipping environment that is part of the e-commerce fulfillment solutions system. We are currently looking to offer the expertise and knowledge we have in this area to new customers.
 
We have built a network operations center (“NOC”) in Carlstadt, New Jersey that allows us to track the location of each of our vehicles and address any on-road disruptions. Our NOC is designed to grow with our business as we add more vehicles for additional routes and expand geographically. Presently, we utilize our NOC solely for our own business. We anticipate that as our revenues grow and the reach and scope of our transportation activities expand (both geographically and within the tristate area in which we currently operate) that we will also generate revenues from services provided via our NOC to other logistics providers.
 
Our Strategy and Competitive Strengths
 
As a result of the termination of Prime EFS’s involvement with Amazon’s DSP Program, we will seek to diversify and grow our business primarily through acquisition of profitable businesses without the previous concentration risk that Prime and Shypdirect had with Amazon. Our strategy is to be a leader in the transportation industry by providing on-time, high-quality pick-up, transportation and long-haul and mid-mile delivery services. We will also attempt to regrow our last-mile business. We attribute our growth and success to date to the following competitive strengths.
 
Market Knowledge and Understanding. While we have been operating our current business for only a few years, our senior management personnel collectively have more than 40 years of experience in the transportation industry and broad knowledge in providing transportation services. These solutions are in high demand, and we hope to resume the growth we experienced prior to December 31, 2020. Members of our senior management team have e-commerce experience with online retailers and understand the dynamics of e-commerce growth, demands and logistics since all or the vast majority of their careers have been in e-commerce businesses. We believe we understand the various segments of the end-to-end solutions required to deliver goods rapidly and accurately between the various pick-up and delivery points in the delivery chain.
 
Unwavering Focus on Relationships and Superior Service. We aim to be the premier platform and partner of choice for our customers. We believe we offer superior services and solutions due to our company-wide commitment to customer service.
 
Experienced and Proven Management Team. We believe our management team is among the most experienced in the industry. Our senior management team brings experience in transportation and logistics, mergers and acquisitions, information technology, e-commerce retailing and fulfillment, and understands the cultural nuances of the e-commerce sectors we serve.
 
We hope to leverage our competitive strengths to increase shareholder value through the following core strategies.
 
Build Upon Strong Customer Relationships to Expand Organically. Prior to September 30, 2020, we built a strong relationship with Amazon that allowed us to expand the size of our service area and add higher margin services to our service offerings. We are continuing to build upon that relationship in the mid-mile and long-haul markets through Shypdirect.
 
During 2019, due to a decrease in “last mile” routes serviced related to our exit from certain areas in New York and Pennsylvania, we decreased the number of “last mile” local routes we served for Amazon from approximately 200 routes on December 31, 2018 to approximately 150 routes on December 31, 2019. However, we were able to expand the type of transportation services we render to Amazon to include “mid-mile” and long-haul transportation services in which we deliver packages from one distribution center to another or from the distribution center to the U.S. post office. We hope to maintain our relationship with Amazon through Shypdirect. However, even if that business also terminates in May 2021, we intend to utilize the experience gained from that relationship to help us diversify and perform similar services for other customers and delivery service providers.
 
Expand Our Operations to Other Regions of the U.S. Our mid-mile and long-haul delivery services are currently provided in the eastern United States. As we continue to expand our marketing and customer relationships, we anticipate expanding our geographic footprint to provide such services, and to capture market share, in other regions of the U.S. by opening our own operations centers and warehouses, acquiring existing regional transportation and logistics companies operating in other areas and partnering with local operators in other regions. We believe the expansion of our business in other regions of the U.S. will also allow us to expand our relationships with existing customers who operate in those regions.

Pursue Value-Enhancing Strategic Acquisitions. We intend to pursue strategic acquisitions as a means of adding new markets in the United States, expanding our transportation and logistics service offerings, adding talented management and operational employees, expanding and upgrading our technology platform and developing operational best practices. We are currently at various stages of reviewing several potential acquisition targets and believe we have significant opportunities to grow our business through our knowledge of our industry and possible acquisition targets.
 
Enhance Our Operating Margins. We hope to enhance our operating margins through a combination of increased operational efficiencies, leveraging our existing assets and distribution facilities and increasing our usage of technology to help us better plan, execute and monitor the performance of our services and transportation assets.
 
Technology
 
An integral part of our operating philosophy is the utilization of technology to support our transportation services and provide our employees with real time information on the status of our operations. We believe our focus on technology as a support to our operations allows our employees to focus on performing at high levels for the benefit of our customers.
 
Each of our vehicles contain mobile communications devices. By being “always-connected”, we can monitor the real time location, performance and effectiveness of our drivers as well as the operating condition of the vehicle. The advancements in what is referred to as the telematic space allow us to develop more detailed and actionable solutions in the performance of our pick-up, transport and deliver operations – all an integral part of our e-commerce fulfillment solutions.
 
We regularly collect data, generate automatic reporting and measure that information against key performance indicators such as routes taken, travel time, destination arrival and departure time. Just as the e-commerce retailer instantaneously and continuously tracks what has been sold, our vehicles are tracked in parallel with the packages being tracked by our customer. Our NOC is designed to be scalable and will be expanded in reach and performance capability as our revenues grow and our assets increase in number.
 
Customers and Markets
 
Prior to the fourth quarter of 2019, our package delivery services were provided primarily in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania; however, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we expanded operations in four (4) new markets in Georgia, Florida, Ohio and Tennessee.
 
Prior to September 30, 2020, we continued to operate in the foregoing markets. However, effective September 30, 2020, Prime’s participation in Amazon’s Delivery Service Provider program terminated. As a result, as of October 1, 2020, our sole markets are the long-haul and mid-mile markets, and currently our major customer for these services is Amazon.
 
As a result, we continue to have customer concentration risk, which we hope to address by expanding our organic growth through the addition of new customers and through the acquisition of businesses that provide transportation services for new customer bases.
 
We also hope to make our delivery and fulfillment solutions available to retailers besides Amazon.
 
Acquisition
 
On January 15, 2021, through a newly-formed, wholly-owned, subsidiary, Shyp FX, Inc., we simultaneously executed an asset purchase agreement (“APA”) and closed a transaction to acquire substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Double D Trucking, Inc., a northern New Jersey-based logistics provider specializing in servicing Federal Express (“FedEx”) over the past 25 years (“DDTI”). DDTI’s annual revenues in 2020 exceeded $1 million. The purchase price is $100,000 of cash and a promissory note of $400,000. The principal assets involved in the acquisition are vehicles for cargo transport, system equipment for vehicle tracking and navigation of vehicles, and delivery route rights together with assumption of associated customer relationships.
 
The acquisition of DDTI will make the Company an approved contracted service provider of FedEx, which, we believe, fits in well with our current geographic coverage area and may lead to additional expansion opportunities within the FedEx network. The Company believes that the acquisition of DDTI, along with the proposed acquisition of Cougar Express, as discussed below, demonstrates that the Company is beginning to resume its growth strategy.
 
Potential Acquisition
 
On November 11 2020, our wholly owned subsidiary, TLSS Acquisition (the “Acquisition Sub”), entered into an asset purchase agreement dated as of November 6, 2020 (“APA”), to acquire substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Cougar Express, Inc., a New York-based full-service logistics provider specializing in pickup, warehousing and delivery services in the tri-state area (“Cougar Express”).
 
Cougar Express is a family-owned full-service transportation business that has been in operation for more than 30 years providing one-to-four person deliveries and offering white glove services. It utilizes its own fleet of trucks, warehouse/driver/office personnel and on-call subcontractors from its convenient and secure New York JFK airport area location, allowing it to pick-up and deliver throughout the New York tri-state area. Cougar Express serves a diverse base of 50 commercial accounts, which are freight forwarders that work with some of the most notable retail businesses in the country. Some of Cougar Express’s accounts have been customers of Cougar Express for more than 20 years.
 
The APA provides for a purchase price equal to $2,350,000 plus 50% of the difference between the accounts receivable acquired by the Acquisition Sub and the accounts payable assumed by the Acquisition Sub. The APA also provides that the Acquisition Sub will also assume indebtedness on certain truck leases and other equipment and service plans for equipment and services that are used by Cougar Express and which will continue to be used post-closing. After closing, the owner of Cougar Express would be barred from competing with the Cougar Express business for five years.
 
The transaction was scheduled to close no later than January 15, 2021, subject to the completion of satisfactory due diligence by us to confirm the accuracy of all of Cougar Express’s representations and warranties in the APA and that Cougar Express has not suffered a material adverse change in its business, and also subject to Cougar Express’s procuring an acceptable landlord’s consent to Cougar Express’s assignment of the lease for its operating facility to the Acquisition Sub, and also subject to our securing financing for the acquisition.

On January 15, 2021, we and Cougar Express entered into Amendment No. 1 to the APA (“Amendment No. 1”) which extended the scheduled closing date to February 16, 2021. In connection with the signing of Amendment No. 1, we paid a refundable deposit of $25,000. On February 17, 2021, we and Cougar Express entered into Amendment No. 2 to the APA (“Amendment No. 2”) which extended the scheduled closing date to March 1, 2021. In connection with the signing of Amendment No. 2, we paid an additional refundable deposit of $25,000.
 
As of this filing, we are negotiating a further extension of the scheduled closing date as well as other terms of the APA. We intend now to restructure the transaction to provide for our acquisition of all of the stock of Cougar Express. We formed wholly owned subsidiary, Shyp CX, Inc. to effectuate this transaction.
 
Consistent with our primary strategy to become a leader in the transportation industry in providing on-time, high-quality pick-up, transportation and delivery services, we expect to accomplish this goal, in part, by pursuing strategic acquisitions as a means of adding new markets in the United States, expanding its transportation and logistics service offerings, adding talented management and operational employees, expanding and upgrading its technology platform and developing operational best practices. Moreover, one factor in assessing acquisition opportunities is the potential for subsequent organic growth post-acquisition.
 
We believe that the acquisition of Cougar Express would fit our current business plan, given Cougar Express’s demographic location, services offered, and diversified customer base, and given that it would provide us with a long-standing, well-run profitable operation as a first step to begin replacing the revenue we lost as a result of Amazon’s terminating its delivery service provider business. Furthermore, we believe that, because Cougar Express is strategically based in New York and serves the tri-state area, organic growth opportunities will be available for expanding its footprint into our primary base of operations in New Jersey, as well as efficiencies that could be derived by leveraging Shypdirect operational capabilities.
 
Competition
 
Transportation services is highly competitive and composed of fragmented marketplaces, with multiple companies competing in the geographic region in which we provide services. We compete on service, reliability, scope and scale of operations, technological capabilities and price. Our competitors include local, regional and national companies that offer the same services we provide — some with larger customer bases, significantly more resources and more experience than we have. Additionally, some of our customers have internal resources that can perform services we offer. Due in part to the fragmented nature of the industry, we must strive daily to retain existing business relationships and forge new relationships.
 
The health of the transportation industry will continue to be a function of domestic economic growth, particularly in the e-commerce marketplace. We believe that we have positioned the Company to grow with and benefit from the e-commerce expansion. Together with our scale, technology and company-specific initiatives, we believe that our positioning should keep us growing faster than the macro environment.
 
Seasonality
 
None.
 
Regulation
 
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies. These regulations impact us directly and indirectly by regulating third-party transportation providers we use to transport freight for our customers.
 
Regulation Affecting Motor Carriers, Owner-Operators and Transportation Brokers. In the United States, our subsidiaries that operate as motor carriers have motor carrier licenses issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). In addition, our subsidiaries acting as property brokers have property broker licenses issued by the FMCSA. Our motor carrier subsidiaries and the third-party motor carriers must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those related to drug-testing, alcohol-testing, hours-of-service, records retention, vehicle inspection, driver qualification and minimum insurance requirements. Weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to government regulations. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to emissions, drivers’ hours-of-service, independent contractor eligibility requirements, onboard reporting of operations, air cargo security and other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Other agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), also regulate our equipment, operations and independent contractor drivers. Like our third-party support carriers, we are subject to a variety of vehicle registration and licensing requirements in certain states and local jurisdictions where we operate. In foreign jurisdictions where we operate, our operations are regulated by the appropriate governmental authorities.
 
In 2010, the FMCSA introduced the Compliance Safety Accountability program (“CSA”), which uses a Safety Management System (“SMS”) to rank motor carriers on seven categories of safety-related data, known as Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories, or “BASICs.”
 
Although the CSA scores are not currently publicly available, we believe such scores will be made public in the future. Our fleet could be ranked worse or better than our competitors, and the safety ratings of our motor carrier operations could be impacted. Our network of third-party transportation providers may experience a similar result. A reduction in safety and fitness ratings may result in difficulty attracting and retaining qualified independent contractors and could cause our customers to direct their business away from the Company and to carriers with more favorable CSA scores, which would adversely affect our results of operations.
 
Classification of Independent Contractors. Tax and other federal and state regulatory authorities, as well as private litigants, continue to assert that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. Federal legislators have introduced legislation in the past to make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements and heighten the penalties for companies who misclassify workers and are found to have violated overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers that meet certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a longstanding, recognized practice. Federal legislators also sought to expand the Fair Labor Standards Act to cover “non-employees” who perform labor or services for businesses, even if said non-employees are properly classified as independent contractors; require taxpayers to provide written notice to workers based upon their classification as either an employee or a non-employee; and impose penalties and fines for violations of the notice requirement and/or for misclassifications. Some states have launched initiatives to increase revenues from items such as unemployment, workers’ compensation and income taxes, and the reclassification of independent contractors as employees could help states with those initiatives. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determinations of independent contractor status. If our independent contractor drivers are determined to be employees, we would incur additional exposure under some or all of the following: federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, and labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.

Environmental Regulations. Our facilities and operations and our independent contractors are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, emissions from vehicles, engine-idling, fuel tanks and related fuel spillage and seepage, discharge and retention of storm water, and other environmental matters that involve inherent environmental risks. Similar laws and regulations may apply in many of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We may be responsible for the cleanup of any spill or other incident involving hazardous materials caused by our operations or business. In the past, we have been responsible for the costs of cleanup of diesel fuel spills caused by traffic accidents or other events, and none of these incidents materially affected our business or operations. We generally transport only hazardous materials rated as low-to-medium-risk, and a small percentage of our total shipments contain hazardous materials. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations and we do not know of any existing environmental condition that reasonably would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. Future changes in environmental regulations or liabilities from newly discovered environmental conditions or violations (and any associated fines and penalties) could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. U.S. federal and state governments, as well as governments in certain foreign jurisdictions where we operate, have also proposed environmental legislation that could, among other things, potentially limit carbon, exhaust and greenhouse gas emissions. If enacted, such legislation could result in higher costs for new tractors and trailers, reduced productivity and efficiency, and increased operating expenses, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations.
