ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview 
 
We are a web-based retailer of clothing, accessories and other personalized gifts for children. We offer our products through our website www.polkadotpatch.com. We do not have any stores or outlets. We were in the process of rebranding our business under the name Maple Tree Kids but have discontinued all of our efforts to rebrand our business and have discontinued our efforts to expand our business. We are no longer devoting any effort in promoting our personalized children products, creating a new logo, marketing and sales collateral, and creating a new website, www.mapletreekids.com and as a result, all corporate development efforts have been discontinued.
 
We have sold our suppliers products to approximately 4,200 customers since our inception, including our largest customer, a large credit union bank that buys gifts for their customers when they have a newborn child, whom presently constitutes approximately 72% of our current business. We have approximately 35 wholesale suppliers that we can acquire products from, all based in the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we sold a total of $6,620 and $10,052, respectively, worth of our products and generated net losses of $24,613 and $36,579, respectively.
 
We have not entered into any formal supply agreements with these vendors and our major supplier to our major customer changed their sales terms to us in November 2016, which has had a significant impact on our business, as discussed in more detail below. We are required to pay in full for products purchased from these vendors upon delivery. If the prices charged by these vendors increase and we are not able to pass on the increased price to our customers, then our margins will be reduced and this will affect our potential for future profitability.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 14, 2013 under the name Maple Tree Kids, Inc. At the time of our incorporation, our sole officer and director, Ms. Irina Goldman, subscribed for and purchased 100,000 (1,000,000 pre-Reverse Split) shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $0.001 per share.
 
We were incorporated in order to acquire by merger all of the limited liability company interests of Maple Tree Kids LLC, a Vermont limited liability company, or MTK LLC. Ms. Goldman had personally acquired all of the limited liability company interests of MTK LLC for a total purchase price of $8,800 on August 16, 2013. MTK LLC then merged with and into our company on September 27, 2013. Our company was the surviving company in the merger and the separate existence of MTK LLC ceased and we succeeded to all of the assets of MTK LLC as a result of the merger. At the effective time of the merger, each limited liability company percentage interest in MTK LLC held by Ms. Goldman was automatically changed and converted into one thousand shares of our common stock. Since Ms. Goldman owned 100% of the limited liability company interests in MTK LLC at the time of the merger, she received a total of 100,000 (1,000,000 pre-Reverse Split) shares of our common stock as a result of the merger. In addition, on September 26, 2013, Ms. Goldman converted $5,000 of indebtedness that our company owed to her into common shares by cancelling such debt in exchange for a total of 500,000 (5,000,000 pre-Reverse Split) shares of our common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement dated as of such date.
 
On December 28, 2016, Aircom Pacific, Inc., a California corporation, or Aircom, purchased all 700,000 (7,000,000 pre-Reverse Split) shares of our common stock held by Ms. Goldman for $320,000, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement among Aircom, Ms. Goldman and our company dated as of such date. Such shares represented approximately 86.3% of our issued and outstanding common stock as of the closing. Accordingly, as a result of the transaction, Aircom became the controlling stockholder of our company. Ms. Goldman resigned as our sole director and officer upon closing of this stock purchase transaction and appointed Mr. Jeffrey Wun as our sole director and our President, Treasurer and Secretary. 
 
We expect to acquire Aircom in the first quarter of 2017 pursuant to a share exchange or similar transaction, whereby Aircom will become our wholly-owned subsidiary and the former stockholders of Aircom will become our controlling stockholders. Following the consummation of this acquisition, we expect to discontinue our business of selling infant and toddler products through the internet and instead solely engage in the business of providing in-flight entertainment and connectivity systems to commercial airlines through Aircom. 
 
On January 9, 2017, we changed our name to Aerkomm Inc. in anticipation of our new business.

Products
 
We sell, at retail, a variety of infant and toddler products, including: infant and toddler clothing, toys, towels, backpacks, gift baskets, infant and toddler holiday items, children’s room decorative items, blankets, baby wraps and slings, gifts for mothers, and infant and toddler accessories. 
 
We maintain over 500 product items in our supply chain and periodically review, add and drop products based upon the demand in the marketplace and product availability.
 
Distribution
 
We sell products through our website www.polkadotpatch.com. We do not manufacture any of our own products and did not keep any inventory of products in 2016.
 
We currently secure our merchandise mostly on a purchase order basis from various wholesale suppliers with whom we have established relationships. We plan to maintain and foster such relationships and to establish and foster new relationships with additional wholesale suppliers. We expect to meet new suppliers through word of mouth introductions, trade shows, and through searches on the Internet. We have never experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining quality merchandise in adequate volumes and at suitable prices.
 
We acquire our products from approximately 35 wholesale vendors all located in the United States, some who will drop-ship the inventory we purchase from them to our customers. We have sold our suppliers products to approximately 4,200 customers since our inception, including our largest customer, a large credit union bank that buys gifts for their customers when they have a newborn child, which constituted approximately 72% of our business in 2016. 
 
We have not entered into any formal supply agreements with these vendors and our major supplier to our major customer changed their sales terms to us in November 2016, which has had a significant impact on our business, as discussed in more detail below.
 
We are required to pay in full for products purchased from our suppliers once we order the products from them. Once we receive an order from our customers, we instruct our suppliers to drop-ship the purchased inventory directly to our customers. We require our customers to pre-pay for products purchased on our websites. The customer authorizes us to charge their credit card at the time of purchase with the understanding that their credit card would be charged upon shipment and title would pass the customer upon shipment.
 
Competition
 
We operate in the infant and toddler products industry and we specialized in the personalized baby and toddler products. We face competition from many websites that provide products and services that are similar to ours. Our strategy to attract customers to our website includes viral marketing, the practice of placing advertisements and offering giveaways on various highly rated baby weblogs or “blogs”, online journals that are updated frequently and available to the public, postings on online communities such as Facebook, MySpace, Yahoo!(R) Groups and amateur websites such as YouTube.com, and other methods of getting Internet users to refer others to our website by e-mail or word of mouth; search engine optimization, marketing our website via search engines by purchasing sponsored placement in search results; and entering into affiliate marketing relationships with website providers to increase our access to Internet consumers. We expect to rely on word of mouth marketing as the primary source of traffic to our website, with search engine optimization and affiliate marketing as secondary sources.
Intellectual Property
 
We own our domain names, mapletreekids.com, polkadotpatch.com and www.sunshinepolkadots.com. but do not have any trademarks or trade names or any other significant intellectual property.
 
Regulation
 
We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. In addition, laws and regulations relating to user privacy, freedom of expression, content, advertising, information security and intellectual property rights are being debated and considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world. We face risks from some of the proposed legislation that could be passed in the future.

In the US, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, which include actions for libel, slander, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, copyright and trademark infringement and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content generated by users. Certain foreign jurisdictions are also testing the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties. Any court ruling that imposes liability on providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties could harm our business.
 
A range of other laws and new interpretations of existing laws could have an impact on our business. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for listing, linking or hosting third-party content that includes materials that infringe copyrights. In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as California's Information Practices Act. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.
 
Employees
 
During and until December 28, 2016, we had one officer, our President, Irina Goldman. Ms. Goldman was not compensated for the services she provided to our company. On December 28, 2016, (i) Ms. Goldman submitted her resignation letter pursuant to which she resigned from all offices of the Company that she held, and (ii) Mr. Jeffrey Wun was appointed to the board of the directors and was also appointed as the President, Treasurer and Secretary of the Company. 
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:

· | have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);
· | submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency;” and 
· | disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation. 

  
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
 
We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
