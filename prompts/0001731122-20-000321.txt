ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 15, 2017. Our original business was the manufacturing and sales of drywall steel studs which were used principally in new developments, commercial and residential construction and in home improvement, remodeling and repair work in Kyrgyzstan. We distributed our drywall steel studs in the Kyrgyz market to wholesale customers. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we sold the machine we had utilized for studs manufacturing as it was outdated, and our production thereafter was put on hold until new equipment was purchased. Our then management actively searched for new equipment which would be more productive and cost effective, so the manufactured products could be more competitive in the market.
 
On February 3, 2020, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated on January 21, 2020, an individual investor (Weining Zheng) purchased 1,500,000 shares of our common stock from our then majority shareholder and sole officer and director, Marat Asylbekov, representing 74% of the voting securities of our company. In connection with the transaction, Mr. Asylbekov resigned from all his positions with our company and Mr. Zheng appointed Li Deng to serve as our President, Treasurer, Secretary and director (collectively, the “Change of Control”). Following the Change of Control, we changed our business plan to engage in smart-home business in the People’s Republic of China.
 
We plan to conduct smart-home business in the People’s Republic of China, with a focus on developing, promoting and executing high quality integrated smart-home systems and solutions. We are presently evaluating the optimal corporate and legal structures in China necessary to establish our business or to acquire and/or invest in existing smart home businesses. We aim to start the smart-home business in 2020 and the funds to financing the start-up of the new business or acquisition of and/or investment in existing smart home business will primarily come from our major shareholder.  However, our plan to operate in the smart home industry may be adversely impacted by the outbreak of coronavirus, which was first reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and is now continuing to spread throughout other parts of the world. Although China has made great efforts to contain the spread of the virus and had brought the outbreak under control, the economy, financial market and businesses in China have been suffering from the pandemic. We may change our plan to do business in other industries in China should we determine that the smart home industry is materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of coronavirus and it is no longer in the best interest of our stockholders and the Company to proceed with our original plan.
