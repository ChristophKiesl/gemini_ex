Item 1.    Business
(a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGISTRANT’S BUSINESS
The Registrant was incorporated in Mississippi in 1955, and is a fully, vertically-integrated poultry processing company engaged in the production, processing, marketing and distribution of fresh and frozen chicken products. In addition, the Registrant is engaged in the processing, marketing and distribution of processed and minimally prepared chicken.
The Registrant sells ice-packed, chill-packed, bulk-packed and frozen chicken, in whole, cut-up and boneless form, primarily under the Sanderson Farms® brand name, to retailers, distributors, and casual dining operators in the United States and to customers who resell frozen chicken into export markets. During its fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, the Registrant processed approximately 657 million chickens, or approximately 4.8 billion dressed pounds. According to 2020 industry statistics, the Registrant was the third largest processor of dressed chicken in the United States based on average weekly processed pounds.
The Registrant's fresh and frozen chicken operations presently encompass 11 hatcheries, 9 feed mills, 12 processing plants and 1 prepared chicken plant. The Registrant has contracts with operators of approximately 823 grow-out farms and 231 breeder farms that provide it with sufficient housing capacity for its current operations. 
The Company’s prepared chicken product line includes approximately 60 institutional and consumer-packaged, partially cooked or marinated chicken items that it sells nationally, primarily to distributors and food service establishments. A majority of the prepared chicken items are made to the specifications of food service users.
Since the Registrant completed the initial public offering of its common stock in May 1987, the Registrant has significantly expanded its operations by expanding existing facilities, adding second shifts and constructing new facilities to increase production capacity, product lines and marketing flexibility. Since 1992, when the Company sold approximately 361.4 million pounds of product, the Company has constructed 8 new hatcheries, 6 new feed mills and 8 new processing plants. As a result of our expansion efforts, the Company's production capacity has significantly increased, and in fiscal 2020 the Company sold approximately 4.9 billion pounds of product, which includes approximately 98.8 million pounds from its prepared chicken plant. 
The Company changed its marketing strategy in 1997 to move away from growing small-sized birds serving primarily the fast food industry to concentrate its production on medium-sized and larger-sized birds serving the retail grocery and food service industries, respectively. This shift resulted in larger average bird weights of the chickens processed by the Company, and substantially increased the number of pounds processed by the Company. In addition, the Company continually evaluates internal and external expansion opportunities to continue its growth in poultry and/or related food products.
The Company is a party to a revolving credit facility dated March 21, 2019, with a maximum available borrowing capacity of $1.0 billion. Under the credit facility, the Company may not exceed a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of 50%. The Company has a one-time right, at any time during the term of the agreement, to increase the maximum debt to total capitalization ratio then in effect by five absolute percentage points in connection with the construction of a new poultry complex for the four fiscal quarters beginning on the first day of the fiscal quarter during which the Company gives written notice of its intent to exercise this right. The Company has not exercised this right. The facility also sets a minimum net worth requirement that at October 31, 2020, was $1.0 billion. The credit is unsecured and, unless extended, will expire on March 21, 2024. As of October 31, 2020, and December 16, 2020, the Company had borrowed $25.0 million, and had approximately $25.2 million outstanding in letters of credit, leaving $949.8 million of borrowing capacity available under the facility. For more information about the facility, see Item 1.01 of our Current Report on Form 8-K filed March 27, 2019.
(c) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF REGISTRANT’S BUSINESS
General
The Registrant is engaged in the production, processing, marketing and distribution of fresh and frozen chicken and the preparation, processing, marketing and distribution of processed and minimally prepared chicken items. The Registrant has one reporting segment, poultry products. 
The Registrant sells chill-packed, ice-packed, bulk-packed and frozen chicken, in whole, cut-up and boneless form, primarily under the Sanderson Farms® brand name, to retailers, distributors and casual dining operators in the United States and to customers who resell frozen chicken into export markets. During its fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, the Registrant processed approximately 657 million chickens, or approximately 4.8 billion dressed pounds. According to 2020 industry statistics, the Registrant was the third largest processor of dressed chicken in the United States based on average weekly processed pounds.
The Registrant conducts its chicken operations through Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Production Division) and Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Processing Division), both of which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Sanderson Farms, Inc. The production subsidiary, Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Production Division), which has facilities in Laurel, Collins, Hazlehurst and McComb, Mississippi; Bryan, Waco, Palestine, Freestone County, Robertson County, Lindale and Mineola, Texas; Adel, Georgia; and Kinston and Lumberton, North Carolina, is engaged in the production of chickens to the broiler stage. Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Processing Division), which has facilities in Laurel, Collins, Hazlehurst and McComb, Mississippi; Hammond, Louisiana; Bryan, Palestine, Waco and Smith County, Texas; Moultrie, Georgia; and Kinston and St. Pauls, North Carolina, is engaged in the processing, sale and distribution of chicken products.
The Registrant conducts its prepared chicken business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Foods Division), which has a facility in Flowood, Mississippi. This facility is engaged in the processing, marketing and distribution of approximately 60 processed and minimally prepared chicken items, which it sells nationally, principally to distributors and national food service accounts. The facility is managed by the same senior management team that manages our Processing Division. 
Products
The Registrant has the ability to produce a wide range of processed chicken products and prepared chicken items.
Processed chicken is first salable as an ice-packed, whole chicken. The Registrant adds value to its ice-packed, whole chickens by removing the giblets, cutting and deboning the product based on customer specifications, and weighing, packaging and labeling the product to specific customer requirements. The additional processing steps of giblet removal, cutting and close tolerance weighing increase the value of the product to the customer over whole, ice-packed chickens by reducing customer handling and cutting labor and capital costs, reducing the shrinkage associated with cutting, and ensuring consistently sized portions.
The Registrant adds additional value to the processed chicken by deep chilling and packaging whole chickens in bags or combinations of fresh chicken parts, including boneless product, in various sized, individual trays under the Registrant’s brand name, which then may be weighed and pre-priced, based on each customer’s needs. This chill-pack process increases the value of the product by extending shelf life, reducing customer weighing and packaging labor, and providing the customer 
with a wide variety of products with uniform, well designed packaging, all of which enhance the customer’s ability to merchandise chicken products.
To satisfy some customers’ merchandising needs, the Registrant freezes the chicken product, which adds value by meeting the customers’ handling, storage, distribution and marketing needs and by permitting shipment of product overseas where transportation time may be as long as 60 days.
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the contribution, as a percentage of net sales dollars, of each of the Registrant’s major product lines:

Markets and Pricing
The three largest customer markets in the fresh and frozen chicken industry are food service customers that purchase fresh, bulk-packed products produced from a relatively large bird; retail grocery store customers that purchase fresh, tray-packed products produced from a medium-sized bird; and quick-serve food service customers that purchase products produced from relatively small birds.
The following table sets forth, as of October 31, 2020, for each of the Company’s poultry processing plants, the general customer market to which the plant is devoted, the weekly capacity of each plant at full capacity expressed in number of head processed, and the industry's average size of birds processed in the relevant market:

Plant Location | Market | Capacity Per Week | Industry Bird Size
Laurel, Mississippi | Big Bird | 650,000 | | 9.11
Hammond, Louisiana | Big Bird | 650,000 | | 9.11
Hazlehurst, Mississippi ¹ | Big Bird | 650,000 | | 9.11
Collins, Mississippi | Big Bird | 1,300,000 | | 9.11
Waco, Texas | Big Bird | 1,300,000 | | 9.11
Palestine, Texas | Big Bird | 1,300,000 | | 9.11
St. Pauls, North Carolina | Big Bird | 1,300,000 | | 9.11

Tyler, Texas | Chill-Pack Retail | 1,300,000 | | 6.63

Note 1 - At our virtual investor day on October 16, 2020, we announced our intention to reduce the target live weight for our Hazlehurst, Mississippi plant from a big bird size to a chill-pack retail size for the purpose of meeting shifting demand needs, primarily as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and its effects on consumer buying patterns. On approximately November 23, 2020, the live birds processed at the Hazlehurst, Mississippi plant reached our target live weight for chill-pack retail customers. 
Our big bird plants process a relatively large bird. The chicken products produced at these plants are generally sold as fresh, bulk-packed chicken cut into a variety of products, including boneless breast meat, chicken tenders, whole and cut wings and boneless thigh meat, and are sold primarily to food service customers and further processors at negotiated spreads from quoted commodity market prices for those products. We have long-term contracts with many of our customers for these products produced at our big bird plants, but prices for products sold pursuant to those contracts fluctuate based on quoted commodity market prices. The contracts do not require the customers to purchase, or the Company to sell, any specific quantity of product. The dark meat from these birds that is not deboned is sold primarily as leg quarters and drumsticks in the export market or as fresh whole legs to further processors. While we have long-standing relationships with many of our export partners, virtually all of our export sales are at negotiated or spot commodity prices, which prices exhibit fluctuations typical of commodity markets. We have few long-term contracts for this product. 
As of December 16, 2020, the Company had the capacity to process 6.5 million head per week in its big bird plants, which reflects the shift of the Hazlehurst, Mississippi plant from a big bird sized bird to a chill-pack retail sized bird. Our results from these plants are materially affected by fluctuations in the commodity market prices for boneless breast meat, chicken tenders, wings, leg quarters and boneless thigh meat as quoted by Urner Barry.
Urner Barry is an independent company specializing in the timely, accurate and independent reporting on market news and market price quotations to its customers in various food and protein industries, including poultry. The Urner Barry spot market prices for boneless breast meat, chicken tenders, leg quarters, whole wings and boneless thigh meat for the past five calendar years are set forth below and are published with Urner Barry's permission. Realized prices will not necessarily equal quoted market prices since most contracts offer negotiated discounts to quoted market prices, which discounts are negotiated on a customer by customer basis and are influenced by many factors. Selection of a particular market price benchmark is largely customer driven:
Our chill-pack plants process medium sized birds and cut and package the product in various sized individual trays to customers’ specifications. The trays are weighed and pre-priced primarily for customers to resell through retail grocery outlets. The Company sells its chill-pack products both under store brand names and under the Company’s Sanderson Farms® brand name. The Company has contracts ranging in duration from one year to three years with most of its chill-pack customers. These agreements typically provide for the pricing of product based on agreed upon, flat prices or on negotiated formulas that use an agreed upon, regularly quoted market price as the base, as well as various other guidelines for the relationship between the parties. All of our contracts with retail grocery store customers also provide for the sale of negotiated quantities of product at periodically negotiated prices, rather than the flat and formula-driven prices discussed above. None of our contracts with retail grocery store customers require the customers to purchase, or the Company to sell, any specific quantity of product. As of December 16, 2020, the Company had the capacity to process 7.15 million head per week at its chill-pack plants, which reflects the shift of the Hazlehurst, Mississippi plant from a big bird sized bird to a chill-pack retail sized bird. Our results from our chill-pack plants are materially affected by fluctuations in Urner Barry prices and other market benchmarks.
As with products produced at our big bird plants, selection of the desired methodology for pricing chill-pack products is largely customer driven. Prior to the discontinuation in November 2016 of the Georgia Dock index, which had been published by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, many of our chill-pack customers used that index as the base for pricing formulas. As new and renewing contracts have been negotiated, many of our chill-pack customers chose to negotiate flat prices for the life of the contracts, while some of our customers have chosen to use an index published by Express Markets, Inc. ("EMI"). 
Almost all of our products sold by our prepared chicken plant are sold under long-term contracts at fixed prices related to the spot commodity price of chicken at the time the contract is negotiated, plus a premium for additional processing.
Sales and Marketing
The Registrant’s chicken products are sold primarily to retailers (including national and regional supermarket chains and local supermarkets) and distributors within the United States. The Registrant also sells its chicken products to casual dining operators, foreign customers, and United States based customers who resell the products outside of the continental 
United States. This wide range of customers, together with the Registrant’s product mix, provides the Registrant with flexibility in responding to changing market conditions in its effort to maximize profits. This flexibility also assists the Registrant in its efforts to reduce its exposure to market volatility, although its ability to do so is limited.
Sales and distribution of the Registrant’s chicken products are conducted primarily by sales personnel at the general corporate offices in Laurel, Mississippi, by customer service representatives at each of its processing plants and its prepared chicken plant and through independent food brokers. Each plant has individual on-site distribution centers and uses contract carriers for distribution of its products.
Generally, the Registrant prices much of its chicken products based upon weekly and daily market prices reported by private firms such as EMI and Urner Barry. The Registrant’s profitability is affected by such market prices, which may fluctuate substantially and exhibit cyclical and seasonal characteristics. The Registrant will adjust base prices depending upon value added, volume, product mix and other factors. While base prices may change weekly and daily, the Registrant’s adjustments to those base prices are generally negotiated from time to time with customers. The Registrant’s sales are generally made on an as-ordered basis, and the Registrant maintains sales contracts ranging in duration from one year to three years with many of its customers. These agreements, which provide the pricing structure of product, as well as various other guidelines for the relationship between the parties, do not require the customers to purchase or the Company to sell any specific quantity of product. 
From time to time, the Registrant may use television, radio and newspaper advertising, point of purchase material, social media and other marketing techniques to develop consumer awareness of and brand recognition for its Sanderson Farms® products. The Registrant has achieved a high level of public awareness and acceptance of its products in its core markets. Brand awareness is an important element of the Registrant’s marketing philosophy, and it intends to continue brand name merchandising of its products. During calendar 2004, the Company launched an advertising campaign designed to distinguish the Company’s fresh chicken products from competitors’ products. The campaign noted that the Company’s product is a natural product free from salt, water and other additives that some competitors inject into their fresh chicken. The Company continues to use various media to communicate this message today. During fiscal 2016, the Company launched a multi-media advertising campaign designed to explain and support the Company's position regarding the judicious use of antibiotics to prevent illness and treat chickens that become ill. During fiscal 2017, the Company launched a multi-media advertising campaign designed to dispel many of the myths about poultry production. 
While the information presented in the campaigns launched in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 is still available on our website, the Company launched a new multi-media campaign in fiscal 2018 designed to educate consumers on key attributes of our products. In fiscal year 2019, the Company's marketing efforts were primarily focused on digital campaigns that provided new, easily accessible recipes and highlighted the relatively high protein content of poultry. In fiscal 2020, the Company quickly shifted its marketing efforts to adapt to challenges that arose as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on providing supportive and meaningful digital content for the evolving digital shopper. The Company regularly evaluates consumer trends, preferences, perception and awareness of its brand and, while not currently advertising on television, expects to continue to use extensions of previous campaigns and to develop new and relevant content in other media, at least for the near term. 
The Registrant’s prepared chicken items are sold nationally, primarily to distributors and national food service accounts. Sales of such products are handled by sales personnel of the Registrant and by independent food brokers. Prepared chicken items are distributed from the Registrant’s plant in Flowood, Mississippi, through arrangements with contract carriers.
Production and Facilities
General. The Registrant is a fully, vertically-integrated producer of fresh, frozen and minimally prepared chicken products, controlling the production of hatching eggs, hatching, feed manufacturing, growing, processing and packaging of its product lines.
Breeding and Hatching. The Registrant maintains its own breeder flocks for the production of hatching eggs. The Registrant’s breeder flocks are acquired as one-day old chicks (known as pullets and cockerels) from primary breeding companies that specialize in the production of genetically designed breeder stock. As of October 31, 2020, the Registrant maintained contracts with 70 independent contract pullet producers for the grow-out of pullets (growing the pullet to the point at which it is capable of egg production, which takes approximately six months). Thereafter, the mature breeder flocks are 
transported by the Registrant’s vehicles to breeder farms that are maintained, as of October 31, 2020, by 161 independent contract producers under the Registrant’s supervision. Eggs produced on the farms of independent contract breeder producers are transported to the Registrant’s hatcheries in the Registrant’s vehicles.
The Registrant owns and operates eleven hatcheries located in Mississippi, Texas, Georgia and North Carolina where eggs are incubated, vaccinated and hatched in a process requiring 21 days. The chicks are vaccinated against common poultry diseases and are transported by the Registrant’s vehicles to independent contract grow-out farms. As of October 31, 2020, the Registrant’s hatcheries were capable of producing an aggregate of approximately 14.1 million chicks per week.
Grow-out. The Registrant places its chicks on the farms of 823 independent contract broiler producers, as of October 31, 2020, located in Mississippi, Texas, Georgia and North Carolina, where broilers are grown to an age of approximately seven to nine weeks. The farms provide the Registrant with sufficient housing capacity for its operations, and are typically family-owned farms operated under contract with the Registrant. The farm owners provide facilities, utilities and labor; the Registrant supplies the day-old chicks, feed and veterinary and technical services. The independent contract poultry producers are compensated pursuant to an incentive formula designed to promote production cost efficiency.
Historically, the Registrant has been able to accommodate expansion in grow-out facilities through additional contract arrangements with independent contract producers.
Feed Mills. An important factor in the grow-out of chickens is the rate at which chickens convert feed into body weight. The Registrant purchases primary feed ingredients on the open market. Ingredients include corn and soybean meal, which are the largest cost components of the Registrant’s total feed costs. The quality and composition of the feed are critical to the conversion rate, and accordingly, the Registrant formulates and produces its own feed. As of October 31, 2020, the Registrant operated nine feed mills, four of which are located in Mississippi, three in Texas, one in Georgia and one in North Carolina. The Registrant’s annual feed requirements for fiscal 2020 were approximately 5.1 million tons, and it has the capacity to produce approximately 6.6 million tons of finished feed annually under current configurations.
Feed grains are commodities subject to volatile price changes caused by weather, size of harvest, transportation and storage costs, domestic and export demand and the agricultural and energy policies of the United States and foreign governments. On October 31, 2020, the Registrant had the capacity to store approximately 4.4 million bushels of corn at its feed mills, which was sufficient to store approximately one week's requirements for corn. Generally, the Registrant purchases its corn and other feed ingredients at current prices from suppliers and, to a limited extent, directly from farmers. Feed grains are available from an adequate number of sources. Although the Registrant has not experienced and does not anticipate problems in securing adequate supplies of feed grains, price fluctuations of feed grains have a direct and material effect upon the Registrant’s profitability. Although the Registrant attempts to manage the risk of volatile price changes in grain markets by sometimes purchasing grain at current prices for future delivery, it cannot eliminate the potentially adverse effect of grain price increases.
Processing. Once broilers reach processing weight, they are transported in the Registrant's vehicles to the Registrant’s processing plants. These plants use modern, highly automated equipment to process and package the chickens. The Registrant’s McComb and Collins, Mississippi; Moultrie, Georgia; Kinston and St. Pauls, North Carolina and Bryan, Waco, Palestine and Tyler, Texas processing plants operate two processing lines on a double shift basis with the capacity to process approximately 1,300,000 chickens per week as of October 31, 2020. The Registrant’s Laurel and Hazlehurst, Mississippi and Hammond, Louisiana processing plants operate on a double shift basis with the capacity to process approximately 650,000 chickens per week as of October 31, 2020. At October 31, 2020, the Company’s deboning facilities had the capacity to produce approximately 20.2 million pounds of big bird boneless breast and tenders finished product and 12.4 million pounds of chill-pack boneless breast and tenders finished product each week.
Prepared Chicken. The Company's prepared chicken plant is located in Flowood, Mississippi and has approximately 85,000 square feet of refrigerated manufacturing and storage space. The plant uses highly automated equipment to prepare, process and freeze prepared chicken items.
Executive Offices; Other Facilities. The Registrant’s laboratory and corporate offices are located on separate sites in Laurel, Mississippi. The office buildings house the Company’s corporate offices, meeting facilities and computer equipment and constitute the corporate headquarters. As of October 31, 2020, the Registrant operated 16 automotive maintenance shops, which service over 1,400 over-the-road and farm vehicles used to support the Registrant's operations. In addition, the 
Registrant has one child care facility located near its Collins, Mississippi processing plant, which, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was temporarily closed as of October 31, 2020.
Quality Control
The Registrant believes that quality control is important to its business and conducts quality control activities throughout all aspects of its operations. The Registrant believes these activities are beneficial to efficient production and in ensuring its customers receive wholesome, high quality products.
The Company's Director of Technical Services supervises the operation of a laboratory in Laurel, Mississippi which, among other things, monitors sanitation at the hatcheries, quality and purity of the Registrant’s feed ingredients and feed, the health of the Registrant’s breeder and broiler flocks, and conducts microbiological tests on live chickens, facilities and finished products. The Registrant conducts on-site quality control activities at each of its twelve processing plants and the prepared chicken plant.
Regulation
The Registrant’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, including, but not limited to, the Federal Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and corresponding state agencies. The Registrant’s chicken processing plants are subject to continuous on-site inspection by the USDA. The Registrant's prepared chicken plant operates under the USDA’s Total Quality Control Program, which is a strict self-inspection plan written in cooperation with and monitored by the USDA. The FDA inspects the production at the Registrant’s feed mills.
Compliance with existing regulations has not had a material adverse effect upon the Registrant’s earnings or competitive position in the past. Management believes that the Registrant is in substantial compliance with existing laws and regulations relating to the operation of its facilities and does not know of any major capital expenditures necessary to comply with such statutes and regulations.
The Registrant takes extensive precautions to ensure that its flocks are healthy and that its processing plants and other facilities operate in a healthy and environmentally sound manner. Events beyond the control of the Registrant, however, such as an outbreak of disease in its flocks or the adoption by governmental agencies of more stringent regulations, could materially and adversely affect its operations.
Competition
The Registrant is subject to significant competition from regional and national firms in all markets in which it competes. Some of the Registrant’s competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than the Registrant.
The primary methods of competition are price, product quality, number of products offered, brand awareness and customer service. The Registrant has emphasized product quality and brand awareness through its advertising strategy. See “Business — Sales and Marketing.” Although poultry is relatively inexpensive in comparison with other meats, the Registrant competes indirectly with the producers of other meats and fish, since changes in the relative prices of these foods may alter consumer buying patterns.
Customers
Two customers each accounted for more than 10% of the Registrant’s consolidated sales for the years ended October 31, 2020, October 31, 2019, and October 31, 2018. Sales to the two customers in fiscal 2020 accounted for 14.9% and 12.7%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net sales, in 2019 accounted for 15.8% and 11.8%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net sales, and in fiscal 2018 accounted for 14.3% and 10.5%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated net sales. The Company does not believe the loss of these or any other single customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company because it could sell poultry earmarked for any single customer to alternative customers at market prices.
Sources of Supply
During fiscal 2020, the Registrant purchased its pullets and cockerels from a single major breeder. The Registrant has found the genetic breeds or cross breeds supplied by this company produce chickens most suitable to the Registrant’s purposes. The Registrant has no written contracts with this breeder for the supply of breeder stock. Other sources of breeder stock are available, and the Registrant continually evaluates these sources of supply.
Should breeder stock from its present supplier not be available for any reason, the Registrant believes that it could obtain adequate breeder stock from other suppliers.
Other major raw materials used by the Registrant include feed grains and other feed ingredients, cooking ingredients and packaging materials. The Registrant purchases these materials from a number of vendors and believes that its sources of supply are adequate for its present needs. The Registrant does not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining these materials in the future.
Seasonality
The demand for the Registrant’s chicken products generally is greatest during the spring and summer months and lowest during the winter months.
Trademarks
The Registrant has registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office the trademark Sanderson Farms®, which it uses in connection with the distribution of its prepared chicken and premium grade chill-pack products. The Registrant considers the protection of this trademark to be important to its marketing efforts due to consumer awareness of and loyalty to the Sanderson Farms® label. The Registrant also has registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office six other trademarks that are used in connection with the distribution of chicken and other products and for other competitive purposes.
The Registrant, over the years, has developed important non-public proprietary information regarding product-related matters. While the Registrant has internal safeguards and procedures to protect the confidentiality of such information, it does not generally seek patent protection for its technology.
Human Capital Resources
As of October 31, 2020, the Registrant had 17,445 employees. Of these, 1,980 employees were salaried and 15,465 were hourly. A collective bargaining agreement with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCWIU) covers 625 hourly employees at our processing plant in Hammond, Louisiana and expires on November 30, 2022. A collective bargaining agreement with UFCWIU covers 1,540 production, maintenance and clean-up employees at our Bryan, Texas processing facility and expires on December 31, 2023. We believe our overall relations with our workforce are very good.
Our Culture and Values.  Our company culture is the cornerstone of all our human capital programs. We believe our culture, which is based upon our core value of respect for the inherent dignity, equality and worth of every human being, is a key reason for our success. It is enshrined in our corporate Statement of Philosophy, first drafted in 1969, and in our Company Vision, Statement on Human Rights and Corporate Code of Conduct. In particular, our Company Vision calls upon our team to treat all persons with absolute respect and integrity and to be devoted to the success of everyone in our organization in fulfilling their potential in all aspects of life.
Safety and Health. The safety, health and welfare of our employees are paramount to our company. Our occupational health and safety programs are overseen by our President’s safety committee, which meets quarterly to set specific goals for workplace safety and measure attainment of those goals. Even though we have built more poultry complexes than any other company in the U.S. since 1993 and hired an additional 13,000 employees, our OSHA injury rates have declined by 67% during that time. For fiscal year 2019, we set a goal to reduce our OSHA injury rates by 10% compared to 2018, and we exceeded that goal, with rates declining by over 21%. In fiscal 2020, our OSHA injury rates declined another 6.3% compared to 2019. Cumulatively for the five years ended October 31, 2020, we had the fewest OSHA citations per 1,000 employees of any company in our industry having more than 5,000 employees.
We work closely with ergonomists to continuously monitor our employees’ working conditions and implement measures to ensure their wellness. For example, we have set our processing line speeds at the lowest rate of any company in our industry to reduce employee stress and injuries. This also contributes to favorable yields and product quality. We have numerous programs to promote the overall good health and wellness of our workforce. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, we implemented extensive safety measures throughout our company during fiscal 2020 to protect our employees from COVID-19. These are described in detail in this report in "Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI"). We strive to foster a work environment that includes and embraces racial, ethnic and gender diversity and other individual differences. As of the end of fiscal year 2020, 48% of our total workforce were women and 87% were minorities. Additionally, 22% of our management team were women and 48% were minorities. During fiscal year 2020, 45% of our new hires were women and 88% of our new hires were minorities. Our management diversity committee, which was established in 2011, oversees and strategically plans for diversity and inclusion within our company. For example, the committee has expanded our long-standing recruitment program targeted at Historically Black Colleges and Universities ("HBCUs"), and in fiscal 2019, 23% of the company’s summer interns were recruited from HBCUs. In fiscal 2020, the committee formed a new steering committee as a grassroots, action-oriented team to champion positive change. Additionally, our board of directors formed a special board committee on DEI, whose initial task is to engage an independent DEI consultant to perform a top to bottom review of our goals, strategy, policies, practices and messaging on DEI. We have a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and harassment and have several systems under which employees can report incidents confidentially or anonymously and without fear of reprisal.
Recruitment, Retention and Development.  The primary way we recruit and retain employees is by ensuring that our compensation and benefits are the most competitive in our industry. In fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, we awarded our hourly workforce across-the-board pay increases that place them at the top of the wage scale in the poultry industry. Our progressive pay scale begins at $15.45 per hour after the first 90 days of employment. After one year of employment, employees participate in our employee stock ownership plan at no cost to them and we match 100% of their contributions to our 401(k) plan for the first 3% of salary contributed and 50% for the next 2% of salary contributed. We pay 75% of the premium cost of our health insurance plan for employees and their families. We also have an extensive training program that provides both hourly and management training and other opportunities for professional and personal development and mentorship. Our training program is a critical part of our focus on employee safety, operational efficiency, employee wellness and welfare and our corporate culture. We invested $3.3 million in our employee training and development programs in fiscal 2020.
