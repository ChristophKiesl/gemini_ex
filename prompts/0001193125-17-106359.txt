ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Organization and Background 
 Mills Music Trust (the Trust) was created by a Declaration of Trust, dated December 3, 1964 (the Declaration of Trust), for the purpose of acquiring from Mills Music, Inc. (Old Mills), the right to receive payment of a deferred contingent purchase price obligation (the Contingent Portion) payable to Old Mills. The obligation to pay the Contingent Portion arose as the result of the sale by Old Mills of its music and lyric copyright catalogue (the Catalogue) to a newly formed company pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated December 5, 1964 (the Asset Purchase Agreement). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, payment of the Contingent Portion to the Trust continues until the end of the year in which the last copyright in the Catalogue expires and cannot be renewed. 
 The Contingent Portion amounts are currently payable by EMI Mills Music Inc. (EMI), the owner of the copyrighted materials contained in the Catalogue. The Trust has been advised that Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC (Sony/ATV) is the administrator and manager of EMI and the Catalogue. 
 HSBC Bank, USA, N.A. is the Corporate Trustee of the Trust (the Corporate Trustee), and Lee Eastman and Michael E. Reiss are the Individual Trustees of the Trust (the Individual Trustees and together with the Corporate Trustee, the Trustees). 
 Proceeds from Contingent Portion Payments 
 The Trust receives quarterly payments of the Contingent Portion from EMI and distributes the amounts it receives to the registered owners of Trust Certificates (the Unit Holders) representing interests in the Trust (the Trust Units), after payment of, or withholdings in connection with, expenses and liabilities of the Trust. The Declaration of Trust provides that these are the Trusts sole responsibilities and that the Trust is prohibited from engaging in any business activities. 
 Payments of the Contingent Portion to the Trust are based on royalty income which the Catalogue generates. The Trust does not own the Catalogue or any copyrights or other intellectual property rights and is not responsible for collecting royalties in connection with the Catalogue. As the current owner and administrator of the Catalogue, EMI is obligated under the Asset Purchase Agreement to use its best efforts to collect all royalties, domestic and foreign, in connection with the Catalogue and to remit a portion of its royalty income to the Trust as its Contingent Portion payment obligation, in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. 
 Calculation of the Contingent Portion 
 The amount of each payment of the Contingent Portion is based on a formula set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. For information regarding the calculation of the Contingent Portion and a related dispute between EMI and the Trust see Contingent Portion Payments under Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Cash Distributions to Unit Holders 
 The Declaration of Trust provides for the distribution to the Unit Holders of all funds the Trust receives after payment of, or withholdings in connection with, expenses and liabilities of the Trust. 
The Copyright Catalogue 
 The Catalogue is estimated to be composed of over 25,000 music titles (the Copyrighted Songs), of which approximately 1,600 produced royalty income in recent years. Based on information which EMI provided to the Trust, most of the royalty income generated by the Catalogue during recent years has been produced by a relatively small number of the Copyrighted Songs with copyrights established prior to 1960.

EMI has provided the Trust with a listing (the 2016 Listing) of the top 50 earning songs in the Catalogue during the 2016 calendar year (the Top 50 Songs). The totals contained in the right most column of the 2016 Listing represent gross royalty payments EMI received for each of the Top 50 Songs, before it made deductions in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement. The 2016 Listing also contains the following additional information for each song title: the writer(s), the original copyright date and copyright renewal date and the date on which each copyright enters the public domain in the United States. 
 The 2016 Listing is set forth below in the form that EMI provided to the Trust. There can be no assurance that the 2016 Listing is indicative of the future performance of the Copyrighted Songs or that EMI will be able to retain its rights to the Copyrighted Songs during their full term of copyright protection. As of the date of this report, the Trust has not undertaken an audit to confirm the accuracy of the information contained in the 2016 Listing, and there can be no assurance by the Trust that the information EMI provided in the 2016 Listing is correct.

Accounting Policies 
 EMI typically makes payments to the Trust of the Contingent Portion in March, June, September and December for the prior calendar quarter. The payments received are accounted for on a cash basis, as are expenses of the Trust. The Declaration of Trust provides for the distribution of the amounts it receives in Contingent Portion payments to the Unit Holders after payment of, or withholdings in connection with, expenses and liabilities of the Trust. 
 The Trusts financial statements reflect only cash transactions and do not include transactions that would be recorded in financial statements presented on the accrual basis of accounting, as contemplated by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Trust does not prepare a balance sheet or a statement of cash flows.
