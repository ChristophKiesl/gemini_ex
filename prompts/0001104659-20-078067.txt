ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
Bionik Laboratories Corp. is a healthcare company focused on improving the quality of life of millions of people with neurological or mobility impairments by combining artificial intelligence and innovative robotics technology to help individuals from hospital to home to regain mobility, enhance autonomy, and regain self-esteem.
 
The Company uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to make rehabilitation methods and processes smarter and more intuitive to deliver greater recovery for patients with neurological or mobility impairments. These technologies allow large amounts of data to be collected and processed in real-time, enabling appropriately challenging and individualized therapy during every treatment session. This is the foundation of the InMotion® therapy. The Company’s rehabilitation therapy robots are built on an artificial intelligence platform, measuring the position, the speed and the acceleration of the patient 200 times per second. The artificial intelligence platform is designed to adapt in real time to the patient’s needs and progress while providing quantifiable feedback of a patient’s progress and performance, in a way that the Company believes a trained clinician cannot.
 
Based on this foundational work, the Company has a portfolio of products focused on upper and lower extremity rehabilitation for stroke and other mobility-impaired individuals, including three InMotion® robots currently in the market and two products in varying stages of development.
 
COVID-19
 
As a result of extended shutdowns of businesses around the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a slowdown in our business as most of the capital expenditure programs of the healthcare facilities that make up our customer base have been put on hold. This, along with our typically long sales cycle, has affected our ability to generate revenues in recent months. As a result, we have taken steps to address the decrease in revenue, as follows:
 

· | Effective April 1, 2020, we furloughed three employees in the United States and temporarily laid-off one employee in Canada. Additionally, our senior management agreed to a salary deferral of between 30-50%. Our remaining employees in the U.S. received base salary reductions of between 30%-50%. In Canada, our remaining employees received a reduction in base salary and hours of 45%. As a result of obtaining the U.S. and Canadian government’s programs described below, U.S. employees with salaries less than $100,000 annually were returned to full salary and with salaries exceeding $100,000 annually were increased to 75% of their normal base salary. Most Canadian employees were returned to their normal base salary. Senior management are continuing with the previously established salary deferrals.

Our Business
 
The InMotion® therapy uses the Company’s robots to assist patients to rewire a segment of their brains after injury, also known as neuroplasticity. The InMotion® Robots - the InMotion® ARM, InMotion® WRIST and the InMotion® ARM/HAND – are designed to provide intelligent, adaptive therapy in a manner that has been clinically shown to maximize neurorecovery. 
 
The Company commenced developing a next generation home version of the InMotion® upper-body rehabilitation technology, and may develop a lower-body wearable assistive product which is in technical development and based on the Company’s existing ARKE lower body exoskeleton technology, which could allow certain mobility impaired individuals to walk better. The Company intends to continue development of these new products as when the Company has sufficient funds and resources. We may in the future further augment our product portfolio through technology acquisition opportunities should they become available and if we are sufficiently capitalized to undertake these investments.
 
The InMotion® ARM, InMotion® ARM/HAND, and InMotion® WRIST are robotic therapies for the upper limbs. InMotion® robotic therapies have been characterized as Class II medical devices by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and are listed with the FDA to market and sell in the United States. More than 280 of our clinical robotic products for stroke rehabilitation have been sold in over 15 countries, including the United States. In addition to these fully developed, clinical rehabilitation solutions, we are also developing “InMotion HomeTM”, which is an upper extremity product that allows the patient to extend their therapy for as long as needed while rehabilitating at home. This rehabilitation solution is being developed on the same design platform as the InMotion® clinical products.
 
We believe recent payment changes in the U.S. marketplace proposed and finalized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will create a favorable environment for greater clinical adoption of our robotic technology. For instance, the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014, or the Impact Act of 2014, began the shift toward standardizing patient assessment data for quality measures. The updated Prospective Payment System (PPS), SNF QRP (Quality Reporting Program) and SNF VBP (Value Based Purchasing) programs have further shifted reimbursement toward the needs of the patient and away from volume of services provided in the skilled nursing setting. Other programs have caused a similar shift in the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility setting, as well, resulting in such providers being publicly ranked, as well as financially rewarded, for quality reporting and better outcomes.
 
We have a growing body of clinical data for our products. More than 1,500 patients participated in trials using our InMotion® robots, the results of which have been published in peer-reviewed medical journals (including the New England Journal of Medicine and Stroke). 
 
An earlier model of InMotion® robots were used in a multicenter randomized controlled phase III interventional trial, funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Program (RATULS) in the United Kingdom. The study was completed in 2018, included the enrollment of 770 stroke patients in a multi-center randomized controlled research trial to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of robot-assisted training in post-stoke care. The RATULS trial confirmed the finding of previous research studies which demonstrated that robot assisted therapy improved upper limb impairment when compared with conventional care of stroke victims.

The primary outcome for upper limb success was determined by an Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), with four distinct success criteria that varied according to baseline severity. This test with these success criteria was developed by the RATULS trial team for this study and has not been used previously in clinical trials. The findings of this major research trial demonstrated that robot assisted therapy improved upper limb impairment, however, using this ARAT measurement, the trial was unable to conclude that robot assisted therapy or enhance upper limb therapy resulted in improved upper limb functionality after stroke compared with usual care provided to patients with stroke related upper limb functional limitation. The study findings also showed that the attrition rate was drastically reduced in the patient population following either robotic therapy or enhanced upper limb therapy versus usual care only. Most of the withdrawals from the study were before 3 months of usual care due to the disappointment with the treatment allocation.
 
We collaborated with Intelliware Development, a leading custom software solutions company based in Toronto, to customize and deploy a new software platform, InMotion ConnectTM. InMotion ConnectTM is designed to target the critical need to link patient centric rehabilitation results to patient management portals. InMotion ConnectTM will provide the ability for hospital management to access remotely to management dashboards presenting the utilization data of each of their InMotion® robotic devices and their robotic devices’ productivity. Customized reporting capabilities in the platform focus on facility and organization measurement dashboards to support effective decision making for clinicians and for hospital management. Through further customization with each hospital system, patients progress during the therapy sessions and patient’s evaluation will be made available and ultimately feed electronic medical records (EMR) at any hospital or rehabilitation facility. We believe that leveraging Intelliware’s healthcare software development expertise will ensure the HL7 compliant InMotion Connect™ will seamlessly feed data through existing various hospital protocols, providing practitioners protected patient data and treatment results.
 
On December 14, 2018, we entered into a Sale of Goods Agreement (the “Agreement”) with CHC Management Services, LLC, or Kindred, pursuant to which, among other things, Kindred agreed to purchase from us in a first phase a minimum of 21 of the Company’s InMotion® ARM Interactive Therapy Systems – a minimum of one for each of Kindred’s existing and soon-to-open affiliated inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and similar facilities described in the Agreement, and in a second phase a minimum of one InMotion® ARM Interactive Therapy System for each future facilities of Kindred, during the four-year minimum term of the Agreement. 21 InMotion® robots were sold in total to Kindred by March 31, 2019.

We have worked with industry leaders in manufacturing and design and have also expanded our development team through partnerships with researchers and academia.
 
We have also entered into an agreement with Cogmedix Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Coghlin Companies, a medical device development and manufacturing company located in West Boylston, MA, to produce InMotion® robots. The initial agreement is for turnkey, compliant manufacturing with the capability of scaling faster production to meet increased volume as the Company grows. In addition, our Massachusetts-based manufacturing facility is compliant with ISO- 13485 and FDA regulations.
 
We currently hold an intellectual property portfolio that includes 5 U.S. patents and 1 U.S. pending patent, 5 of which are pending internationally, as well as other patents under development. We may file provisional patents from time to time, which may expire if we do not pursue full patents within 12 months of the filing date. Two provisional patents have recently been filed, pertaining to BIONIK’s InMotion HomeTM development and recently launched InMotion ConnectTM platform, each of which the Company plans to file as a full patent prior to the 12-month deadline. Additionally, we hold exclusive licenses to three additional patents of which one is currently being used for the InMotion® Wrist and is licensed to us from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 
We have filed trademarks in the U.S. and European Union for InMotion®, InMotion Home™, InMotion Connect™, InMotion Pulse™, and InMotion Insights™; the trademark for InMotion® is registered in the European Union and in the U.S., the trademark for InMotion Connect is registered in the European Union and pending in the US, while InMotion Home™, InMotion Pulse™, and InMotion Insights™ are pending in both jurisdictions.
 
We currently sell our products directly or can introduce customers to a third-party finance company to lease at a monthly fee over the term or other fee structure for our products to hospitals, clinics, distribution companies and/or buying groups that supply those rehabilitation facilities.
 
We introduced our new enhanced commercial version of the InMotion® product line starting with the InMotion® ARM in December 2017 and then the InMotion® ARM/HAND in January 2019. We sold 11 InMotion® robots in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, 33 InMotion® robots in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 and 17 InMotion® robots for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.
 
We had $2,153,354 of revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 compared to $3,246,038 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.

Products in Market
 
InMotion® Robots
 
Our suite of robotic rehabilitation products are the result of medical engineering research and original development at the Newman Laboratory for Biomechanics and Human Rehabilitation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
 
We believe that our robotic products have exceptional capacity for measurement and immediate interactive response, which sets them apart from other therapy systems:
 
·                  Patient can be set up to rehabilitate on the InMotion® robots within 2 minutes.
 ·                  InMotion® robots senses the patient’s movement and responds to a patient’s continually changing ability.
 ·                  Using artificial intelligence, the robots guide the exercise treatment accordingly:
 

· | If the patient is unable to move, the robot assists the patient to initiate movement towards the target.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | If coordination is a problem, using artificial intelligence, the robot “guides” the movement, allowing the patient to move towards the target and confirming that the patient is practicing the movement the correct way; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As the patient gains movement control, the robot provides less assistance and continually challenges the patient; and provides quantifiable feedback on progress and performance that can be downloaded.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
InMotion® robots have been tested by leading medical centers in controlled clinical trials, including large randomized controlled clinical studies. Through research, we have determined that the best way to optimize robot therapy is by allowing the robots to focus on reducing impairments and allowing the therapist to assist on translating the gains into function.
 
We believe that our modular systems approach to neurorehabilitation is designed to optimize the use of robotics in a manner that is consistent with the latest clinical research and neuroscience, taking into account the latest understanding on motor learning interference and motor memory consolidation.
 
More than two hundred eighty InMotion® robots have been sold for research and rehabilitation in over 15 countries, including the United States. Extensive research has shown the InMotion® robots to be effective, especially for stroke, cerebral palsy and Parkinson’s disease. Based on clinical trials using the InMotion® ARM, the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke council and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs recommended, in 2010, the use of robot-assisted therapy to improve upper extremity motor coordination in individuals with some voluntary finger extension in outpatient and chronic care settings. In the trial conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs, results demonstrated efficacy and a reduction in healthcare expenses when using the InMotion® ARM when compared to non-robotic therapy.
 
InMotion® ARM
 
The InMotion® ARM is an evidence-based intelligent interactive rehabilitation technology that senses patient movements and limitations, providing assistance as needed in real time. It allows clinicians to effectively deliver optimum intensive sensor motor therapy to the shoulder and elbow to achieve the development of new neural pathways and helps patients regain motor function following a neurological condition or injury. We launched in 2018 a new version of the InMotion® ARM, which has a 40% smaller footprint than the previous generation and has wireless report printing, among other improvements. The product is characterized as a Class II medical device by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is listed with the FDA as 510(k) exempt, allowing the product to be marketed in the United States.

InMotion® ARM/HAND 
 
The InMotion® ARM/HAND provides support for therapy involving reaching with grasp and release movements, and individual hand movements. It allows clinicians to efficiently deliver optimal intensive sensory motor therapy to the hand to develop new neural pathways and helps patients regain motor function following a neurological condition or injury. The product is characterized as a Class II medical device by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is listed with the FDA as 510(k) exempt, allowing the product to be marketed in the United States.
 
On January 23, 2019, we announced the commercial launch of our newest generation InMotion® ARM/HAND robotic system for clinical rehabilitation of stroke survivors and those with mobility impairments due to neurological conditions. The improved new generation InMotion® ARM/HAND was developed according to the same principals of motor learning and neuro plasticity that were incorporated into the original InMotion® ARM robotic system and utilizes artificial intelligence and data analysis to provide individualized therapy and reports that empower patients. It includes the following new features:
 

· | Enhanced hand-rehabilitation technology: The updated hand robot provides therapy focused on hand opening and grasping for patients ready to retrain reach and grasp functional tasks.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | InMotion® EVAL: The InMotion® ARM/HAND offers the ability to assess hand movements in a precise and objective manner, allowing the clinician to better measure and quantify a patient’s progress and response to therapy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improved, comprehensive reporting: Optimized report formats provide improved documentation of patient outcomes, improved ease of use and enhanced interpretation of evaluation results, allowing clearer indications of progress over their complete rehabilitation journey, all on one screen.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
InMotion® WRIST
 
The InMotion® WRIST is an evidence based interactive rehabilitation device that senses patient movements and limitations and provides assistance as needed. It can accommodate the range of motion of a normal wrist in everyday tasks and can be used by clinicians as a stand-alone treatment option or in addition to the InMotion® ARM. The InMotion® WRIST enables clinicians to efficiently deliver optimum intensive sensor motor wrist and forearm therapy to patients with neurological conditions. The product is characterized as a Class II medical device by the U.S. and is listed with the FDA as 510(k) exempt, allowing the product to be marketed in the United States.
 
InMotion CONNECTTM
 
In June 2020, we launched our InMotion Connect™ platform, a comprehensive solution to meet the data connectivity and analytics needs of hospitals and healthcare facilities nationwide that utilize the InMotion® robots.
 
InMotion Connect™ is a cloud-based data analytics solution that securely streams and stores anonymized data from all connected InMotion® robotics devices to our cloud server hosted by Amazon AWS, providing contextual and relevant data to reach hospital clinicians and management teams when it matters the most. It combines real-time data of each InMotion® robotic device with the deep clinical knowledge and expertise of our clinical specialists to collaboratively partner with each clinic to promote utilization of the robotic devices and support clinician engagement, with the goal of enhancing patient care. Reporting capabilities in the platform focus on deep data analytics with customizable and adaptive dashboards to support effective decision making for clinicians and for hospital management.
 
Mercy Rehabilitation Hospital Oklahoma City, a Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services (“Kindred”) managed site, is our flagship deployment of InMotion Connect™. The deployment follows a pilot program with Kindred where more than 20 hospitals participated in an initiative to use data to empower on-site and hospital system-wide decision making to drive better technology adoption. Cloud-based data analytics were combined with our clinical specialists to collaboratively partner with local staff to drive optimal use of InMotion® technology, while the resulting data was utilized by both local and corporate hospital management to support better utilization of the robots as well as improved patient outcomes.
 
InMotion Connect™  has been designed to target the critical need to link patient centric rehabilitation results to patient management portals. InMotion ConnectTM provides the ability for hospital management to access remotely to management dashboards presenting the utilization data of each of their InMotion robotic devices and their robotic devices productivity. Customized reporting capabilities in the platform focus on facility and organization measurement dashboards to support effective decision making for clinicians and for hospital management. Through further customization with each hospital systems, patients progress during the therapy sessions and patient’s evaluation will be made available and ultimately feed electronic medical records (EMR) at any hospital or rehabilitation facility. We will ensure the HL7 compliant InMotion Connect™ will seamlessly feed data through existing various hospital protocols, providing practitioners protected patient data and treatment results.
 
Product Pipeline 
 
In addition to our existing suite of products, we have other product candidates under development, all of which have been suspended as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and due to cash constraints.


InMotion HOMETM
 
The InMotion HomeTM is an upper extremity product that would allow patients to extend their therapy for as long as needed while rehabilitating at home and is being developed on the same design platform as the InMotion® clinical products described above. The InMotion HomeTM is on engineering hold at a technical development stage due to prioritizing the development of the InMotion ConnectTM.

Lower Body Robotic Products
 
The ARKE is a robotic lower body exoskeleton that was under development and to be designed for wheelchair bound individuals suffering from spinal cord injuries, stroke and other mobility disabilities. As a result of a combination of our concentrating on the commercialization of the InMotion® robots, our lack of additional funds, and changes in the marketplace, we determined to suspend the further development of the ARKE as a rehabilitation device, and instead, building on our existing ARKE exoskeleton technology, focus on a lower body robotic assistive device as well as other technology targeting the consumer market, that could allow mobility impaired individuals to walk better. This product development is on engineering hold at a technical development stage due to prioritizing the development of the InMotion ConnectTM.
  
Other Prospective Products
 
We have exclusively licensed the rights to manufacture and sell products and methodologies covered by a patent for a lower limb robotic rehabilitation apparatus and method for rehabilitating gait, owned in part by Dr. Hermano Igo Krebs, one of our former directors and executive officers; however, this product has not yet been developed.
 
We may from time to time expand our product offerings and enhance the strength of our Company through internal development, as well as through strategic and accretive partnerships or acquisitions from time to time.
 
Competition and Competitive Advantage
 
The medical technology equipment industry is characterized by strong competition and rapid technological change. There are several companies developing technologies that are competitive to our existing and proposed products, many of them, when compared to our Company, having significantly longer operational history and greater financial and other resources.
 
The primary competitor for the InMotion® product line of upper-body rehabilitation robots is Hocoma, a Swiss-based company. Other competitors include Motorika and Tyromotion as well as other known and unknown smaller potential competitors that may compete with us directly or indirectly. We believe that the InMotion® product line’s primary advantage over Hocoma is the evidence based, research proven data that supports each of our products. Evidence based, research proven data is used to support reimbursement from health systems, insurance companies and governments.
 
The prime competitors for our lower body robotics assistive device in development are Honda, Cyberdyne and Ekso Bionics. We expect it, once developed, to compete as a personal choice physical enhancement consumer product.
 
Our challenge will be achieving rapid market awareness and adoption of our emerging technology in rehabilitation and mobility centers throughout the U.S., Canada, and any other market we may enter. Our existing InMotion® robots and technologies are expected to significantly help with third party clinical trials and our ability to launch our lower-extremity development products into the market, as we intend to leverage third party clinical data on our rehabilitative products and international distributorships and relationships with rehabilitation centers around the world.
 
Robotic technology and its use in clinical settings is a new and emerging industry and is regulated by medical device regulatory agencies (such as the US Food and Drug Administration). We believe that we will face challenges of increased regulatory scrutiny, possible changes in regulator’s requirements, meeting quality control standards of various government regulators, increased competition in the future based on other new technologies, additional features and customizability, reduced pricing, clinical outcomes and other factors. Our strength in this market will depend on our ability to achieve market acceptance, develop new technologies, develop new products, implement production plans, develop marketing strategies, secure regulatory approvals, secure necessary data for reimbursement, protect our intellectual property and have sufficient funding to meet all these challenges.
 
The market for the Company’s other prospective products also has competition and is subject to rapid technological change and regulatory requirements. There can be no assurance that the Company will be in a strong position to respond quickly to potential acquisitions and other market opportunities, new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position could materially affect the business and our prospects.

Market Strategy
 
The Company’s current products are designed to be rehabilitation products and mobility solutions for patients in hospitals and clinics. We currently have three robotic products that are listed with the FDA, which are the products sold through our own sales team in the United States, as well as through third party distributors around the world. Our business plan in part relies on broad adoption of upper and lower body robotic rehabilitation products to provide neuro rehabilitation to individuals who have suffered a neurological injury or disorder.
 
The sales of our clinical and proposed products could depend, in part, on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities or individual users are reimbursed by government authorities, private insurers and other third-party payers for the costs of our products or the services performed with our products.
 
The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third-party payers, which can vary among public and private sources and by country, may affect which products are purchased by customers and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction. Reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies. Legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the United States or abroad, or changes in reimbursement rates by private payers, could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using the Company’s products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products, which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers may be willing to pay for such products. The change at the end of 2019 under certain US government plans to reimburse SNF’s (Skilled Nursing Facilities) followed by IRF’s (Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities) based on outcome and quality data, is currently being rolled out; however, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on capital expenditure programs of the healthcare facilities may make it difficult to reach those goals and is still being assessed.
 
The Company has committed to a commercial strategy to maximize its efforts to position its solutions with multi-location, high patient volume rehabilitation organizations. The Company believes its robotic systems are a good match to the patient care and business objectives relevant to these larger organizations operating on a regional or national basis.
 
Outside of the US, our focus is to use distributors to sell in local markets and we currently have a distributor in South Korea. As a result of the recent termination of our cooperative joint venture in China, we are evaluating our China strategy. Our efforts to penetrate the European market are supported by having attained the CE marking which signifies that products sold in the European Economic Area (EEA) have been assessed to meet high safety health and environmental protection requirements.
 
Our market strategy will be the development of hospital and clinic relationships that will allow us to gain acceptance of the technology among experts and patients. We are also seeking a number of government grants in collaboration with various hospitals and clinics to allow us to partially fund trials and research projects. We expect to gain traction among the doctors and experts involved in the distribution and buying groups that are established within those selected partner hospitals.
 
We currently sell our robots or can introduce customers to a third-party finance company to lease at a monthly fee over term or other fee structure for our products to hospitals, clinics, distribution companies and/or buying groups that supply those rehabilitation facilities.
 
Our market strategy also relies on identifying and entering into joint venture arrangements with third parties that can assist us with the development, commercialization and distribution of our technologies and products. For instance, we have entered a relationship with Curexo Inc. of South Korea to distribute our InMotion® robots to that market.

IMT entered into an Agreement, executed on December 31, 1999, to license two of the above-referenced patents from MIT with a royalty of 3% on sales within the United States and 1.5% for sales outside the United States, with a minimum annual royalty of $10,000. To date, we have not determined whether we intend to commercialize the patent relating to the pelvis.
 
Dr. Krebs, a former director and former executive officer and a founder of IMT, is a co-licensor pursuant to an Agreement dated June 8, 2009, of patent #8,613,691, pursuant to which we are required to pay Dr. Krebs and Caitlyn Joyce Bosecker an aggregate royalty of 1% of sales based on such patent. As this product connected to the patent is not yet commercialized, no sales have been made.

We have to date and generally plan to continue to enter non-disclosure, confidentially and intellectual property assignment agreements with all new employees as a condition of employment. In addition, we also generally enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with consultants, manufacturers’ representatives, distributors, suppliers, investors, financial partners and others to attempt to limit access to, use and disclosure of our proprietary information.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development programs are pursued by engineers and scientists employed by us in Toronto and Boston on a full- time basis or hired as per diem consultants. InMotion® robots are based on research and development originally done at MIT. Our InMotion® Wrist product is based on a patent that we license from MIT.
 
We also work with advisors who are industry leaders in manufacturing and design and researchers and academia. Our leading robotic advisor is Dr. Neville Hogan of MIT. We are also working with subcontractors in developing specific components of our technologies. The primary objective of our research and development program is to advance the development of our existing and proposed products, to enhance the commercial value of such products.
 
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, the Company incurred $3,889,461 and $3,174,892, respectively, in research and development costs. Research and development expenses have increased due to increased staff members; however, project development project costs are comparable to the prior year.
 
As a result of steps we have taken to address the decrease in revenue caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has reduced working on its research and development projects to focus only on the development of InMotion ConnectTM , to provide the ability for hospital management to access remotely to management dashboards presenting the utilization data of each of their InMotion® robotic devices and their InMotion® robotic devices productivity.


Government Regulations
 
General
 
Our medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and various other federal and state agencies, as well as foreign governmental agencies in Canada, Europe, South America, and Asia. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of our medical device products.
 
In addition to the below, other regulations we encounter are the regulations that are common to all businesses, such as employment legislation, implied warranty laws, and environmental, health and safety standards, to the extent applicable. We will also encounter in the future industry-specific government regulations that would govern our new products, if and when developed for commercial use. It may become the case that other regulatory approvals will be required for the design and manufacture of our products and proposed products.
 
U.S. Regulation
 
Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, medical devices are classified into one of three classes — Class I, Class II or Class III — depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. The InMotion® robots are classified as Class II 510 (k) exempt products. Our manufacturing facility in Boston is compliant with ISO 13485 and FDA regulations.
 
We also are required to establish a suitable and effective quality management system, which establishes controlled processes for our product design, manufacturing, and distribution. We are doing this in compliance with the internationally recognized standard ISO 13485 Quality Management Systems. Following the introduction of a product, the FDA and foreign agencies may engage in periodic reviews of our quality systems, as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials. These regulatory controls, as well as any changes in FDA or other foreign agencies’ policies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction, and continued availability of new products.

Where possible, we anticipate these factors in our product development processes.
 
These agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products in foreign countries. InMotion® robots have also been designated as Class IIa devices in the EU. Whether or not we obtain FDA clearance for the marketing, sale and use of a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required by the FDA.
 
The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change and or additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.
 
Employees
 
As of May 21, 2020, we had 18 full-time employees, 1 part-time employee, 2 consultants and 1 paid engineering student who are based in our principal executive office located in Toronto, Canada, and our Watertown, Massachusetts facility. These employees oversee day-to-day operations of the Company supporting management, engineering, research and development, sales and marketing and administration functions of the Company. As required, we also engage consultants to provide services to the Company, including quality assurance and corporate services. We have no unionized employees.
 
We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory; however, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and our responses, including furloughs, layoffs, and salary reductions and deferrals, we can give no assurance that our employees will not terminate their employment with us.
