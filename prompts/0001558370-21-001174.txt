ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations, estimates, and projections as of the date of this filing. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 7 of Part II – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Our Company
Waste Connections, Inc. is the third largest solid waste services company in North America, providing non-hazardous waste collection, transfer and disposal services, along with recycling and resource recovery, in mostly exclusive and secondary markets in the U.S. and Canada. Waste Connections also provides non-hazardous oil and natural gas exploration and production, or E&P, waste treatment, recovery and disposal services in several basins across the U.S., as well as intermodal services for the movement of cargo and solid waste containers in the Pacific Northwest. 
As of December 31, 2020, we served residential, commercial, industrial and E&P customers in 43 states in the U.S. and six provinces in Canada:  Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming, and the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Québec and Saskatchewan.
Our senior management team has extensive experience in operating, acquiring and integrating non-hazardous waste services businesses, and we intend to continue to focus our efforts on both internal and acquisition-based growth. We anticipate that a part of our future growth will come from acquiring additional waste businesses and, therefore, we expect that additional acquisitions could continue to affect period-to-period comparisons of our operating results.
Our Operating Strategy
Our operating strategy seeks to improve financial returns and deliver superior shareholder value creation within the solid waste industry. We generally seek to avoid highly competitive, large urban markets and instead target markets where we can attain high market share either through exclusive contracts, vertical integration or asset positioning. We also target niche markets, like E&P waste treatment and disposal services, with similar characteristics. We are a leading provider of waste services in most of our markets, and the key components of our operating strategy, which are tailored to the competitive and regulatory factors that affect our markets, are as follows:
Target Secondary and Rural Markets. By targeting secondary and rural markets, we believe that we are able to achieve a higher local market share than would be attainable in more competitive urban markets, which we believe reduces our exposure to customer churn and improves financial returns. In certain niche markets, like E&P waste treatment and disposal, early mover advantage in certain rural basins may improve market positioning and financial returns given the limited availability of existing third-party-owned waste disposal alternatives.
Control the Waste Stream. In markets where waste collection services are provided under exclusive arrangements, or where waste disposal is municipally owned or funded or available at multiple sources, we believe that controlling the waste stream by providing collection services under exclusive arrangements is often more important to our growth and profitability than owning or operating landfills. 
Optimize Asset Positioning. We believe that the location of disposal sites within competitive markets is a critical factor to success in the waste services industry. Given the importance of and costs associated with the transportation of waste to treatment and disposal sites, having disposal capacity proximate to the waste stream may provide a competitive advantage and serve as a barrier to entry.

Provide Vertically Integrated Services. In markets where we believe that owning landfills is a strategic advantage to a collection operation because of competitive and regulatory factors, we generally focus on providing integrated services, from collection through disposal of solid waste in landfills that we own or operate.
Manage on a Decentralized Basis. We manage our operations on a decentralized basis. This places decision-making authority closer to the customer, enabling us to identify and address customers’ needs quickly in a cost-effective manner. We believe that decentralization provides a low-overhead, highly efficient operational structure that allows us to expand into geographically contiguous markets and operate in relatively small communities that larger competitors may not find attractive. We believe that this structure gives us a strategic competitive advantage, given the relatively rural nature of many of the markets in which we operate, and makes us an attractive buyer to many potential acquisition candidates.
We manage our operations through the following five geographic operating segments: our Southern segment services customers located in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Dakota, southern Oklahoma, western Tennessee, Texas, Wyoming and along the Gulf of Mexico; our Eastern segment services customers located in Delaware, northern Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin; our Western segment services customers located in Alaska, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and western Wyoming; our Central segment services customers located in Arizona, Colorado, southern Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, western Texas, Utah and eastern Wyoming; and our Canada segment services customers located in the state of Michigan and in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Québec and Saskatchewan. 
We manage and evaluate our business on the basis of the operating segments’ geographic characteristics, interstate waste flow, revenue base, employee base, regulatory structure, and acquisition opportunities. Each operating segment has a regional vice president and a regional controller reporting directly to our corporate management. These regional officers are responsible for operations and accounting in their operating segments and supervise their regional staff. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our segment reporting of our operations.
Each operating location has a district or site manager who has a high degree of decision-making authority for his or her operations and is responsible for maintaining service quality, promoting safety, implementing marketing programs and overseeing day-to-day operations, including contract administration. Local managers also help identify acquisition candidates and are responsible for integrating acquired businesses into our operations and obtaining the permits and other governmental approvals required for us to operate.
Implement Operating Standards. We develop company-wide operating standards, which are tailored for each of our markets based on industry norms and local conditions. We implement cost controls and employee training and safety procedures and establish a sales and marketing plan for each market. By internalizing the waste stream of acquired operations, we can further increase operating efficiencies and improve capital utilization. We use a wide-area information system network, implement financial controls and consolidate certain accounting, personnel and customer service functions. While regional and district management operate with a high degree of autonomy, our executive officers monitor regional and district operations and require adherence to our accounting, purchasing, safety, marketing, legal and internal control policies, particularly with respect to financial matters. Our executive officers regularly review the performance of regional officers, district managers and operations. We believe we can improve the profitability of existing and newly acquired operations by establishing operating standards, closely monitoring performance and streamlining certain administrative functions.
Our Growth Strategy
We tailor the components of our growth strategy to the markets in which we operate and into which we hope to expand.
Obtain Additional Exclusive Arrangements. Our operations include market areas where we have exclusive arrangements, including franchise agreements, municipal contracts and governmental certificates, under which we are the 

2



exclusive service provider for a specified market. These exclusive rights and contractual arrangements create a barrier to entry that is usually obtained through the acquisition of a company with such exclusive rights or contractual arrangements or by winning a competitive bid.
We devote significant resources to securing additional franchise agreements and municipal contracts through competitive bidding and by acquiring other companies. In bidding for franchises and municipal contracts and evaluating acquisition candidates holding governmental certificates, our management team draws on its experience in the waste industry and knowledge of local service areas in existing and target markets. Our district management and sales and marketing personnel maintain relationships with local governmental officials within their service areas, maintain, renew and renegotiate existing franchise agreements and municipal contracts, and secure additional agreements and contracts while targeting acceptable financial returns. Our sales and marketing personnel also expand our presence into areas adjacent to or contiguous with our existing markets, and market additional services to existing customers. We believe our ability to offer comprehensive rail haul disposal services in the Pacific Northwest improves our competitive position in bidding for such contracts in that region.
Generate Internal Growth. To generate internal revenue growth, our district management and sales and marketing personnel focus on increasing market penetration in our current and adjacent markets, soliciting new customers in markets where such customers have the option to choose a particular waste collection service and marketing upgraded or additional services (such as compaction or automated collection) to existing customers. We also seek price increases necessary to offset increased costs, to improve operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our deployed capital. Where possible, we intend to leverage our franchise-based platforms to expand our customer base beyond our exclusive market territories. As customers are added in existing markets, our revenue per routed truck increases, which generally increases our collection efficiencies and profitability. In markets in which we have exclusive contracts, franchises and governmental certificates, we expect internal volume growth generally to track population and business growth.
Expand Through Acquisitions. We intend to expand the scope of our operations by continuing to acquire waste businesses in new markets and in existing or adjacent markets that are combined with or “tucked-in” to our existing operations. We focus our acquisition efforts on markets that we believe provide significant growth opportunities for a well-capitalized market entrant and where we can compete efficiently with potential new competitors. This focus typically highlights markets in which we can:  (1) provide waste collection services under exclusive arrangements such as franchise agreements, municipal contracts and governmental certificates; (2) gain a leading market position and provide vertically integrated collection and disposal services; or (3) gain a leading market position in a niche market through the provision of treatment and disposal services. We believe that our experienced management, decentralized operating strategy, financial strength, size and public company status make us an attractive buyer to certain waste collection and disposal acquisition candidates. We have developed an acquisition discipline based on a set of financial, market and management criteria to evaluate opportunities. Once an acquisition is closed, we seek to integrate it while minimizing disruption to our ongoing operations and those of the acquired business.
In new markets, we often use an initial acquisition as an operating base and seek to strengthen the acquired operation’s presence in that market by providing additional services, adding new customers and making “tuck-in” acquisitions of other waste companies in that market or adjacent markets. We believe that many suitable “tuck-in” acquisition opportunities exist within our current and targeted market areas that may provide us with opportunities to increase our market share and route density.
The North America solid waste services industry has experienced continued consolidation over the past several years, most notably with the acquisition of Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. by Waste Management, Inc. in October 2020 and our acquisition of Progressive Waste (as defined below) in June 2016. In spite of this consolidation, the solid waste services industry remains regional in nature, with acquisition opportunities available in select markets. In some markets in both MSW and E&P waste, independent landfill, collection or service providers lack the capital resources, management skills and/or technical expertise necessary to comply with stringent environmental and other governmental regulations and to compete with larger, more efficient, integrated operators. In addition, many of the remaining independent operators may wish to sell their businesses to achieve liquidity in their personal finances or as part of their estate planning.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed 21 acquisitions for consideration having a net fair value of $481.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed 21 acquisitions for consideration having a net fair value of $837.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed 20 acquisitions for consideration having a net fair value of $1.032 billion. 
HUMAN CAPITAL
We believe that people are our greatest differentiator. We aim to be an employer of choice that attracts and retains high performing talent with the mindset, skillset and commitment to uphold our values of safety, integrity, customer service, and being a great place to work and the premier solid waste services company in the U.S. and Canada. All employees are responsible for upholding the Waste Connections Vision and Values, and the Waste Connections Code of Conduct, which form the foundation of our policies and practices. Moreover, we are committed to an inclusive, supportive environment built on the principles of Servant Leadership, valuing diversity and inspiring employee growth. As such, developing our talent and maintaining our culture through employee engagement are integral to the growth and sustainability of our business.
Our Workforce
As of December 31, 2020, our employee population consisted of 18,933 active employees, 9,788 of whom are commercial truck drivers and 1,610 of whom are mechanics. There were 15,978 employees located in the United States and 2,955 employees located in Canada. 39% of our employees were ethnic minorities, 16% were women, and 8% of our employees were from the armed services. 
As of December 31, 2020, 3,172 employees, or approximately 17% of our workforce, were employed under collective bargaining agreements. The majority of our collective bargaining agreements are with the Teamsters Union in both the U.S. and Canada. These collective bargaining agreements are renegotiated periodically. In 2020, we did not experience any work stoppages or have any days idle as a result of labor issues. We have 17 collective bargaining agreements covering 1,254 employees that have expired or are set to expire during 2021. We do not expect any significant disruption in our overall business in 2021 as a result of labor negotiations, employee strikes or organizational efforts by labor unions or their representatives. 
COVID-19 Related Employee Support
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting the health, safety and welfare of our employees has been our top priority. In order to support and protect our employees, we established protocols and implemented operational changes focused on the health and safety of our frontline employees and accommodated transitions to remote work environments for customer service representatives and other support personnel. In addition, recognizing the potential for financial hardship and other challenges, we looked to provide a safety net for our employees on issues of income and family health. 
To that end, in 2020 we incurred over $35 million in incremental COVID-19-related costs, primarily supplemental pay for front line employees. This included bonus payments as well as supplemental wages, which were provided to all front-line employees, whether union or non-union, remote or on-site, as well as temporary workers. We provided full base wages for employees feeling ill, under quarantine, or caring for family members, and two-thirds of base wages for up to 12 weeks for those with childcare needs. We also expanded our Employee Relief Fund for those experiencing financial hardship, launched the Waste Connections Scholarship Program to assist our employees’ children in pursuing their educational goals, covered COVID-19-related testing and medical costs, and expanded and extended access to medical benefits.
In addition to our near-term COVID-19-related financial commitments, we raised our minimum hourly wage target to $15 per hour, which exceeds many state, provincial and local wage requirements. Looking beyond our people, we also recognized the needs of the communities where we live and work, increasing the level of charitable contributions to assist food banks, families at risk, and organizations with a focus on addressing racial inequities at a local or national level, providing meals for healthcare workers and higher risk populations, and donating critical personal protective equipment.

Safety
Safety is our first operating value at Waste Connections. We are committed to the safety of our employees, customers, and the communities we serve. Our ultimate goal is to “Drive to ZERO”, that is, to achieve zero incidents and accidents. Our success in safety is driven by our self-directed and empowered employees taking personal ownership for their safety and the safety of those around them. As servant leaders, we endeavor every day to protect our employees and the communities we are privileged to work in and around. We utilize on-board event recording technology to identify both risky behavior, which is coached, and best practices, which are reinforced. We have developed a risk-based scoring system for our drivers to improve their safe driving skills and hold our leaders responsible for the performance of the employees they are privileged to serve. 
In 2020, this behavior-based approach to safety resulted in a reduction in our incident rate by approximately 12%, with over 60% of our operating locations posting zero safety-related incidents or reduced incident frequency over the prior year.
Safety training is an integral part of our culture of safety. To reinforce safe driving skills and safe work practices throughout Waste Connections, we require both initial training for all new driver employees and reinforcement training each year. Areas of focus in training include: “Target 4” defensive driving, Smith System driving fundamentals, Injury & Illness prevention, and Safe Work Practices training. We further emphasize the importance of safety through regular tailgate safety meetings and rollout safety instructions for our drivers, and through the utilization of electronic safety communication boards, safety alerts, and other communications to heighten awareness and maintain focus every day on the importance of safety. 
While we attribute our successful safety record to our culture and behavior-based approach, we recognize that advances in fleet design and technology can be important tools in identifying risky behaviors and providing coaching opportunities to further our efforts to achieve our long-term aspirational target of a 25% reduction in incident rates as described in our 2020 Sustainability Report (www.wasteconnections.com/sustainability). To that end, in 2020, we initiated a two-year, $10 million fleet-wide upgrade of our on-board event recording technology and introduced Freightliner EconicSD trucks with an overhauled cab design that incorporates many of the safety features already included in passenger vehicles, as well as an integrated collision mitigation system, enhanced visibility, and several ergonomic improvements. 
Culture/Servant Leadership
At Waste Connections, we maintain that our purposeful culture drives differentiated results, and therefore investing in our people is a priority as we employ an approach guided by Servant Leadership. This concept inverts the traditional management hierarchy, positioning leaders to serve their employees both professionally and personally. The philosophy empowers employees by prioritizing their needs, sharing responsibility and driving personal development. As a result, a significant amount of management time and resources are dedicated to leadership training and development.
Training and Development
Our leadership development efforts focus on multi-day Servant Leadership training sessions, in which approximately 25% of our leadership team participated in 2020 in spite of the limitations on in-person training as a result of COVID-19-related travel restrictions. These leadership training sessions, generally conducted in-person but also available online, are developed and administered by dedicated internal resources and also include participation by the senior leadership team. 
In addition, the Company provides a broad range of other training and on-the-job learning opportunities, including district management training, varying leadership webinar topics, and other safety, sales, maintenance, operations and financial training courses engaging every level of employee throughout the Company. Through our Learning Management System (“LMS”), we track employee progress and can utilize the LMS to share new course topics and additional content.

Employee Pay and Benefits
We strive to make Waste Connections a great place to work. Our approach to attracting safe, productive workers includes a focus on providing full time, stable, local jobs with competitive pay and benefits. 
Our pay and benefits strategy is designed to provide programs and services that help meet the varying needs of our employees, particularly during challenging periods like the COVID-19 pandemic, when we increased our targeted minimum wage to $15 per hour and introduced the Waste Connections Scholarship Program, in addition to providing discretionary supplemental pay and benefits, including expanded access to our Employee Relief Fund. Our total rewards package for front line employees includes market-competitive pay, bonus opportunities, affordable and comprehensive healthcare plans, market-leading retirement benefits, generous and flexible time off plans, and the opportunity to share in the Company’s success through an Employee Share Purchase Plan. Our leaders also are eligible for incentive compensation programs consisting of an annual cash bonus, equity, or both, dependent on their contributions to improving safety, financial results, and key human capital measures like turnover, employee development and employee survey scores. 
Employee Engagement
Beyond compensation and benefits, we believe employee engagement includes increased investments in training and development of our leaders and frontline employees, and innovating new technology offerings to increase connectivity both inside and outside of the Company, using a variety of channels to facilitate open and direct communication, including employee resource groups. We recognize the importance of engagement in driving culture and increasing retention, which was magnified in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the use of remote alternatives to in-person training and development and highlighted the importance of connectivity both inside and outside of the Company. 
Indicators of employee engagement include retention, voluntary turnover and satisfaction, as measured through annual Servant Leadership surveys. In 2020, our total turnover improved by 11.2%, with voluntary turnover down 18.0% on a year-over-year basis. 
We conduct an annual Servant Leadership survey, which provides employees the opportunity to evaluate their managers on an anonymous basis and provide written feedback. We target continuous improvement in the scores as an element of the long-term aspirational goals included in our 2020 Sustainability Report. In 2020, our managers’ Servant Leadership scores increased by 1.9%, with an employee response rate of over 87%.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to building and developing diverse teams that function in an environment of mutual respect, where employees feel valued, empowered to contribute and positioned for success. 
In keeping with our efforts to support and encourage diversity and inclusion, we have undertaken several initiatives, including adopting in 2019 a formal Diversity Policy for our Board of Directors and Senior Management with aspirational targets for female Board representation, and additional disclosure on workforce composition. In addition, in 2020, we incorporated diversity and inclusion into Servant Leadership training, focused our leadership summit on understanding and mitigating unintended biases, expanded our Servant Leadership assessments of managers by employees to include diversity and inclusion, enhanced recruiting practices to ensure the broadest candidate pools, established financial commitments to organizations that focus on racial inequities and that support women and children at risk, and supported the development of resource groups including our Women’s Network and Veterans’ S.E.R.V.E. Network. Waste Connections is a signatory to the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion within the workplace. 
Employee Recruiting
In 2020, we hired 4,417 employees through our network of internal recruiters operating on a regional basis out of 10 locations. Our internal recruiting team endeavors to not only fill open positions, but to partner with hiring managers to 

6



continuously improve our efforts with respect to marketing, screening, interviewing, onboarding and employee retention. In addition to recruiting locally in the communities we serve, we use job fairs, open house events, employee referral programs, social media channels, local radio and television advertising, and school to work partnerships. Our job opportunities are hosted on www.careers.wasteconnections.com, posted on www.indeed.com, www.linkedin.com, as well as state and provincial job boards, and syndicated to expand our reach to dozens of diversity-oriented and military-focused recruiting websites such as www.honorher.works, www.jobs.vetjobs.org, www.diversity.dejobs.org, www.enableamerica.dejobs.org and www.campuspride.jobs.
Sustainability/ESG 
Environmental, organizational and financial sustainability initiatives have been key components of our success since we were founded in 1997. We continuously monitor and evaluate new technologies and investments that can enhance our commitment to the environment and improve our competitive positioning. We remain committed to growing and expanding these efforts as our industry and technology continue to evolve. To that end, we have made a $500 million commitment to the advancement of the long-term aspirational targets outlined in our 2020 Sustainability Report. 
The targets include reducing environmental impact through expanded resource recovery capacity, increased landfill gas recovery and biogas generation, and increased on-site leachate treatment at our landfills. In addition, they focus on enhancing employee safety and engagement through reducing safety incident rates, continuous improvement in voluntary turnover, and increased Servant Leadership scores.
WASTE SERVICES
Collection Services
We provide collection services to residential, commercial, municipal, industrial and E&P customers. Our services are generally provided under one of the following arrangements:  (1) governmental certificates; (2) exclusive franchise agreements; (3) exclusive municipal contracts; (4) residential subscriptions; (5) residential contracts; or (6) commercial, industrial and E&P service agreements.
Governmental certificates, exclusive franchise agreements and exclusive municipal contracts grant us rights to provide MSW services within specified areas at established rates and are long-term in nature. Governmental certificates, or G Certificates, are unique to the State of Washington and are awarded by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, or WUTC, to solid waste collection service providers in unincorporated areas and electing municipalities. These certificates typically grant the holder the exclusive and perpetual right to provide specific residential, commercial and/or industrial waste services in a defined territory at specified rates, subject to divestiture and/or overlap or cancellation by the WUTC on specified, limited grounds. Franchise agreements typically provide an exclusive period of seven years or longer for a specified territory; they specify a broad range of services to be provided, establish rates for the services and can give the service provider a right of first refusal to extend the term of the agreement. Municipal contracts typically provide a shorter service period and a more limited scope of services than franchise agreements and generally require competitive bidding at the end of the contract term. In markets where exclusive arrangements are not available, we may enter into residential contracts with homeowners’ associations, apartment owners and mobile home park operators, or work on a subscription basis with individual households. In such markets, we may also provide commercial and industrial services under customer service agreements generally ranging from one to five years in duration. Finally, in certain E&P markets with “no pit” rules or other regulations that limit on-site storage or treatment of waste, we offer containers and collection services to provide a closed loop system for the collection of drilling wastes at customers’ well sites and subsequent transportation of the waste to our facilities for treatment and disposal.
Landfill Disposal Services
As of December 31, 2020, we owned or operated 66 MSW landfills, 12 E&P waste landfills, which only accept E&P waste, 13 non-MSW landfills, which only accept construction and demolition, industrial and other non-putrescible waste, and one development stage landfill. Eight of our MSW landfills also received E&P waste during 2020. We generally own landfills to achieve vertical integration in markets where the economic and regulatory environments make landfill 

7



ownership attractive. We also own landfills in certain markets where it is not necessary to provide collection services because we believe that we are able to attract volume to our landfills, given our location or other market dynamics. Over time, MSW landfills generate a greenhouse gas, methane, which can be converted into a valuable source of clean energy. We deploy gas recovery systems at 51 of our landfills to collect methane, which can then be used to generate electricity for local households, fuel local industrial power plants or power alternative fueled vehicles. In some cases, landfill gas generated at our landfills qualifies as a renewable fuel for which renewable fuel credits may be available.
For landfills we operate but do not own, the owner of the property, generally a municipality, usually holds the permit and we operate the landfill pursuant to a landfill operating agreement for a contracted term, which may be the life of the landfill. Where the contracted term is not the life of the landfill, the property owner is generally responsible for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. We are responsible for all final capping, closure and post-closure obligations at our operated landfills for which we have life-of-site agreements.
Based on remaining permitted capacity as of December 31, 2020, and projected annual disposal volumes, the average remaining landfill life for our owned and operated landfills and landfills operated, but not owned, under life-of-site agreements, is estimated to be approximately 29 years. Many of our existing landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the amount currently permitted. We regularly consider whether it is advisable, in light of changing market conditions and/or regulatory requirements, to seek to expand or change the permitted waste streams or to seek other permit modifications. We also monitor the available permitted in-place disposal capacity of our landfills on an ongoing basis and evaluate whether to seek capacity expansion using a variety of factors.
We are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at ten of our landfills, for which we consider expansions to be probable. Although we cannot be certain that all future expansions will be permitted as designed, the average remaining landfill life for our owned and operated landfills and landfills operated, but not owned, under life-of-site agreements is estimated to be approximately 32 years when considering remaining permitted capacity, probable expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume.
The following table reflects estimated landfill capacity and airspace changes, as measured in tons, for owned and operated landfills and landfills operated, but not owned, under life-of-site agreements (in thousands):

​
The expiration dates for the four operated landfills range from 2022 to 2027. We intend to seek renewal of all four contracts prior to, or upon, their expiration.
Transfer Station Services
We own or operate MSW transfer stations and E&P waste transfer stations with marine access. Transfer stations receive, compact and/or load waste to be transported to landfills or treatment facilities via truck, rail or barge. They extend our direct-haul reach and link collection operations or waste generators with distant disposal or treatment facilities by concentrating the waste stream from a wider area and thus providing better utilization rates and operating efficiencies.
Recycling Services
We offer residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers recycling services for a variety of recyclable materials, including compost, cardboard, mixed paper, plastic containers, glass bottles and ferrous and aluminum metals. We own and operate recycling operations and market collected recyclable materials to third parties for processing before 

9



resale. The majority of the recyclables we process for sale are paper products and are shipped to customers in the United States and Canada, as well as other markets, including Asia. Changes in end market demand as well as other factors can cause fluctuations in the prices for such commodities, which can affect revenue, operating income and cash flows. We believe that recycling will continue to be an important component of local and state solid waste management plans due to the public’s increasing environmental awareness and expanding regulations that mandate or encourage recycling. We also believe that the costs of processing recyclables, including the costs of contamination, which have historically been subsidized by the sale of recycled commodities, need to be fully recognized. To that end, we have increased the fees that we charge for the collection of recyclables and for processing at our recycling facilities to more fully reflect the processing costs associated with the separation of recyclables into marketable commodities. In some instances, we will look to pass the risk associated with the volatility of recycled commodity prices onto our customers. 
E&P Waste Treatment, Recovery and Disposal Services
E&P waste is a broad term referring to the by-products resulting from oil and natural gas exploration and production activity. These generally include: waste created throughout the initial drilling and completion of an oil or natural gas well, such as drilling fluids, drill cuttings, completion fluids and flowback water; production wastes and produced water during a well’s operating life; contaminated soils that require treatment during site reclamation; and substances that require clean-up after a spill, reserve pit clean-up or pipeline rupture. E&P customers are oil and natural gas exploration and production companies operating in the areas that we serve. E&P revenue is therefore driven by vertical and horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing, production and clean-up activity; it is complemented by other services including closed loop collection systems and the sale of recovered products. E&P activity varies across market areas which are tied to the natural resource basins in which the drilling activity occurs and reflects the regulatory environment, pricing and disposal alternatives available in any given market.
We provide E&P waste treatment, recovery and/or disposal services from a network of E&P waste landfills, MSW landfills that also receive E&P waste, E&P liquid waste injection wells and E&P waste treatment and oil recovery facilities. Treatment processes vary by site and regulatory jurisdiction. At certain treatment facilities, loads of flowback and produced water and other drilling and production wastes delivered by our customers are sampled, assessed and tested by third parties according to state regulations. Solids contained in a waste load are deposited into a land treatment cell where liquids are removed from the solids and are sent through an oil recovery system before being injected into saltwater disposal injection wells or placed in evaporation cells that utilize specialized equipment to accelerate evaporation of liquids. In certain locations, fresh water is then added to the remaining solids in the cell to “wash” the solids several times to remove contaminants, including oil and grease, chlorides and other contaminants, to ensure the solids meet specific regulatory criteria that, in certain areas, are administered by third-party labs and submitted to the regulatory authorities.
COMPETITION 
The North America municipal solid waste, or MSW, services industry is highly competitive and requires substantial labor and capital resources. Our competition includes: three publicly-held solid waste companies—Waste Management, Inc., Republic Services, Inc. and GFL Environmental, Inc.; several regional, publicly held and privately owned companies; and several thousand small, local, privately owned companies, including independent waste brokers, some of which we believe have accumulated substantial goodwill in their markets. We compete for collection, transfer and disposal volume based primarily on the price and, to a lesser extent, quality of our services. We also compete with operators of alternative disposal facilities, including incinerators, and with counties, municipalities and solid waste districts that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations. Public sector operators may have financial and other advantages over us because of their access to user fees and similar charges, tax revenues, tax-exempt financing and the ability to flow-control waste streams to publicly owned disposal facilities.
From time to time, competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand their market shares or service areas or to win competitively bid municipal contracts. These practices may cause us to reduce the price of our services or, if we elect not to do so, to lose business. We provide a significant amount of our residential, commercial and industrial collection services under exclusive franchise and municipal contracts and G Certificates. Exclusive franchises and municipal contracts may be subject to periodic competitive bidding. Competition in the solid waste industry is also 

10



affected by the increasing national emphasis in the U.S. and Canada on recycling and other waste reduction programs, which may reduce the volume of waste we collect or deposit in our landfills.
The U.S. and Canadian MSW services industries have undergone significant consolidation, and we encounter competition in our efforts to acquire collection operations, transfer stations and landfills. We generally compete for acquisition candidates with publicly owned regional and national waste management companies. Accordingly, it may become uneconomical for us to make further acquisitions or we may be unable to locate or acquire suitable acquisition candidates at price levels and on terms and conditions that we consider appropriate, particularly in markets we do not already serve.
Competition for E&P waste comes primarily from smaller regional companies that utilize a variety of disposal methods and generally serve specific geographic markets. We also compete in certain markets with publicly held and privately owned companies such as Waste Management, Inc., Republic Services, Inc., Clean Harbors, Inc., US Ecology, Inc., Secure Energy Services Inc., Nuverra Environmental Solutions, Trinity Environmental Services, LLC, Ecoserv, Oilfield Water Logistics (OWL) and others. In addition, customers in many markets have the option of using internal disposal methods or outsourcing to another third-party disposal company. 
REGULATION
Introduction
Our operations in the United States and Canada, including landfills, transfer stations, solid waste transportation, intermodal operations, vehicle maintenance shops, fueling facilities and oilfield waste treatment, recovery and disposal operations, are all subject to extensive and evolving federal, state, provincial and, in some instances, local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, the enforcement of which has become increasingly stringent. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require securing permits or other authorizations (collectively, “permits”) for regulated activities; govern the amount and type of substances that may be released or emitted into the environment in connection with our operations; impose cleanup or corrective action responsibility for releases of regulated substances into the environment; restrict the way we handle, manage or dispose of wastes; limit or prohibit our activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations; and impose specific standards addressing worker protection and health. Compliance is often costly or difficult to achieve, and the violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits, issuance of corrective action orders, assessment of administrative and civil penalties and even criminal prosecution.
In many instances in the United States, liability is often “strict,” meaning it is imposed without a requirement of intent or fault on the part of the regulated entity. The environmental regulations that affect us in the United States are generally administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, state environmental agencies, and other federal, state and local authorities having jurisdiction over our U.S. operations.
The environmental legislation that affects us in Canada is administered by federal and provincial regulatory agencies, which have jurisdiction over certain aspects of our Canadian operations. The relevant Canadian federal environmental legislation that affects our operations is administered by federal departments such as Environment and Climate Change Canada. Provincial and local agencies and departments administer their own environmental legislation, such as the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks. In most instances in Canada, liability for violations of environmental and health and safety laws is imposed without a requirement of intent on the part of the regulated entity, but is subject to a defense of due diligence.
Compliance with existing environmental regulatory requirements and permits requires significant capital and operating expenditures. It is possible that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non-compliance may be incurred in the future. We believe that in recent years, environmental regulation of the industry has increased as have the number of enforcement actions brought by regulatory agencies. It is also possible that other developments, such as the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies, could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently foresee or quantify. Moreover, changes in environmental laws or regulations could 

11



reduce the demand for our services and adversely impact our business. We also expend significant resources (both administrative and financial) directed toward development, expansion, acquisition, and permitting of landfills, transfer stations, and other facilities we operate. Regarding any permit issued by a regulatory agency necessary for our operations, there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain all necessary permits or that any such permit held may ultimately be renewed on the same or similar terms. Further, permits obtained impose various requirements and may restrict the size and location of disposal operations, impose limits on the types and amount of waste a facility may receive or manage, as well as a waste disposal facility’s overall capacity. Additional operational conditions or restrictions may be included in the renewal or amendment of a previously issued permit. As regulations change, our permit requirements could become more stringent and compliance may require material expenditures at our facilities, impose significant operational restraints, or require new or additional financial assurance related to our operations. Regarding any permit that has been issued, it remains subject to renewal, modification, suspension or revocation by the agency with jurisdiction.
Various laws impose cleanup or remediation liability on responsible parties, which are discussed in more detail below. Substances subject to cleanup liability have been or may have been disposed of or released on or under certain of our facility sites. At some of our facilities, we have conducted and continue to conduct monitoring or remediation of known soil and groundwater contamination and, as required, we will continue to perform such work. It is possible that monitoring or remediation could be required in the future at other facilities we own or operate, or previously owned or operated. These monitoring and remediation efforts are usually overseen by environmental regulatory agencies. Further, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners or other third parties to file claims for personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by the release of regulated substances into the environment. In addition, from time to time, our intermodal services business undertakes the transport of hazardous materials. This transportation function is also regulated by various federal, state, provincial and potentially local agencies.
A number of major statutes and regulations apply to our operations, which are generally enforced by regulatory agencies. Typically, in the United States, federal statutes establish the general regulatory requirements governing our operations, but in many instances these programs are delegated to the states, which have independent and sometimes more strict regulation. In Canada, it is typically provincial statutes that establish the primary regulatory requirements governing our waste operations. Federal statutes in Canada govern certain aspects of waste management, including international and interprovincial transport of certain kinds of waste. Certain of these statutes in the United States and Canada contain provisions that authorize, under certain circumstances, lawsuits by private citizens to enforce certain statutory provisions. In addition to penalties, some of these statutes authorize an award of attorneys’ fees to parties that successfully bring such an action. Enforcement actions for a violation of these statutes and related rules, or for a violation of or failure to have a permit, which is required by certain of these statutes, may include administrative, civil and criminal/regulatory penalties, as well as injunctive relief in some instances. In our ordinary course of business, we incur significant costs complying with these statutes, regulations and applicable standards they impose.
A brief description of certain of the primary statutes affecting our operations is discussed below.
Laws and Regulations
A.   Waste and Hazardous Substances
1.   The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, or RCRA
In the United States, RCRA regulates the generation, treatment, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. Regulations promulgated under RCRA impose broad requirements on the waste management industry. In October 1991, the EPA adopted what are known as the Subtitle D Regulations, which govern solid non-hazardous waste landfills. The Subtitle D Regulations establish, among other things, location restrictions, minimum facility design and performance standards, operating criteria, closure and post-closure requirements, financial assurance requirements, groundwater monitoring requirements, groundwater remediation standards and corrective action requirements. These and other applicable requirements, including permitting, are typically implemented by the states, and in some instances, states have enacted more stringent requirements.

12



Waste related to oil and gas exploration and production, or “E&P,” is typically regulated differently than those wastes designated as “hazardous waste.” Regarding the management and disposal of E&P waste, although E&P wastes may contain hazardous constituents, most E&P waste is exempt from stringent RCRA regulation as a hazardous waste. We are required to obtain permits for the land treatment and disposal of E&P waste as part of our operations. The construction, operation and closure of E&P waste land treatment and disposal operations are generally regulated at the state level. These regulations vary widely from state to state. None of our oilfield waste recycling, treatment and disposal facilities are currently permitted to accept hazardous wastes. Some wastes handled by us that currently are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA or other applicable statutes if changes in laws or regulations were to occur. If the RCRA E&P waste exemption is repealed or modified, we could become subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements.
A breach of laws or regulations governing facilities we operate may result in suspension or revocation of necessary permits, civil liability, and imposition of fines and penalties. Moreover, if we experience a delay in obtaining, are unable to obtain, or suffer the revocation of required permits, we may be unable to serve our customers, our operations may be interrupted and our growth and revenue may be limited.
RCRA also regulates underground storage of petroleum and other materials it defines as “regulated substances.” RCRA requires tank registration, compliance with technical standards for tanks, release detection and reporting and corrective action, among other things. Certain of our facilities and operations are subject to these requirements, which are typically implemented at the state level and may be more stringent in certain states.
2.   The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA
CERCLA, which is also known as the “Superfund” law, established a program in the United States allowing federal authorities to provide for the investigation and cleanup of facilities where, or from which, a release of any hazardous substance into the environment has occurred or is threatened. CERCLA defines “hazardous substances” broadly. One of the primary ways that CERCLA addresses a release or threatened release of hazardous substances is by imposing strict, joint and several liability for cleanup on its broad categories of responsible parties. This means that responsible parties can bear liability without fault and that each responsible party potentially could bear liability for the entirety of cleanup costs, notwithstanding its individual contribution. Generally, responsible parties are current owners and/or operators of the contaminated site; former owners and operators of the site at the time when the hazardous substances were disposed; any person who arranged for treatment or disposal of the hazardous substances; and transporters who selected the disposal site. In addition to CERCLA’s liability framework, the EPA may issue orders directing responsible parties to respond to releases of hazardous substances. Further, the EPA and private parties, who have response liability to the EPA or who have incurred response costs, can bring suit against other responsible parties to seek to recover certain costs incurred in their response efforts. CERCLA also imposes liability for the cost of evaluating and remedying damage to natural resources. Various states have enacted laws analogous to and independent of CERCLA that also impose liability, which is typically strict and joint and several, for investigation, cleanup and other damages associated with the release of hazardous or other regulated substances. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or hazardous and other substances regulated under similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations. As a result, we may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA or similar states statutes for all or part of the costs required to cleanup sites if and where these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. CERCLA and these analogous state laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for acts or conditions that were in compliance with applicable laws at a prior time. Under certain circumstances, our sales of residual crude oil collected as part of the saltwater injection process could result in liability to us if the residual crude contains hazardous substances or is covered by one of the state statutes and the entity to which the oil was transferred fails to manage and, as necessary, dispose of it or components thereof in accordance with applicable laws.
3.   Canadian Waste Legislation
The primary waste laws regulating our business in Canada are imposed by the provinces. These include provincial laws that regulate waste management, including requirements to obtain permits and approvals, and regulations with respect to the operation of transfer stations and landfilling sites. Each provincial jurisdiction in Canada has its own regulatory regime; however, the key requirements under these regimes are similar across Canada. For example, the Environmental 

13



Protection Act, or the EP Act, in Ontario and its underlying regulations regulate the generation, treatment, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of wastes in Ontario, among other things. The EP Act requires an approval or, in some cases, a registration, for the establishment, operation or alteration of a waste management system (which includes all facilities or equipment used in connection with waste) or a waste disposal site. The specific terms and conditions of an approval may impose emission limits, monitoring and reporting requirements, siting and operating criteria, financial assurance or insurance and decommissioning requirements. Certain landfilling sites are subject to more stringent regulatory requirements that can include detailed prescribed design standards, leachate collection systems, landfill gas management or collection systems and/or site closure plans including post-closure care requirements. The federal Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 imposes requirements with respect to the interprovincial and international movement of hazardous wastes and hazardous recyclable material, which can affect the movement of wastes and recyclables to our Canadian facilities. The expansion or establishment of certain waste management projects, including waste treatment and landfilling sites, may also be subject to provincial or federal environmental assessment requirements.
A breach of laws or regulations governing our operations may result in suspension or revocation of necessary approvals and imposition of fines and penalties. Moreover, if we experience a delay in obtaining, are unable to obtain, or suffer the revocation of required approvals, we may be unable to serve our customers, our operations may be interrupted, and our growth and revenue may be limited.
4.   Canadian Contaminated Sites Legislation
There are provincial and federal laws in Canada that regulate spills and releases of substances into the environment and require the remediation of contaminated sites. Clean up of contaminated sites in connection with our business is primarily regulated by provincial environmental laws. Each province has its own regulatory regime; however, the key requirements under these regimes are similar across Canada. For example, the EP Act in Ontario authorizes the agency to issue orders to responsible persons to undertake remedial or other corrective actions to investigate, monitor, and remediate the discharge or presence of contaminants in the environment. These orders can generally be issued on a joint and several liability basis to categories of responsible persons, including persons who caused or permitted the discharge of a contaminant, persons who owned the discharged substance, as well as current and past owners of lands or the source of the contamination and persons who have or have had management or control over lands or the source of the contamination. Responsible parties can bear liability under an order without fault. The costs to comply with an order can be very substantial. Some provincial jurisdictions provide a statutory right to compensation from the owner or person in control of a substance that is discharged into the environment to any person who suffers loss as a result. The federal government has also enacted laws that regulate the release of certain substances into the environment. We handle many contaminants and pollutants in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be liable under provincial and federal statutes for all or part of required cleanup costs if substances have been released into the environment. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes (including substances disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or remediate contaminated property (including soil and groundwater contamination, whether from prior owners or operators or other historic activities or spills).
B.   Wastewater/Stormwater Discharge
1.   The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or the Clean Water Act
The Clean Water Act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, solid waste disposal facilities, transfer stations and oilfield waste facilities into Waters of the United States, or WOTUS, including surface and potentially ground waters. Under the Clean Water Act, sites or facilities that discharge pollutants to waters of the United States must have a permit authorizing that discharge. If run-off or other contaminants from our owned or operated transfer stations or oilfield waste facilities, or run-off, collected leachate or other contaminants from our owned or operated landfills or other facilities is discharged into streams, rivers or other regulated waters, the Clean Water Act would require a discharge permit. These permits typically contain requirements to conduct monitoring and, under certain circumstances, to treat and reduce the quantity of pollutants in such discharge. Further, if a landfill or other facility discharges wastewater through a treatment works, it may be required to comply with additional permitting and other specific requirements. Also, virtually all landfills are required to comply with the EPA’s storm water regulations, which are designed to prevent the introduction of contaminated storm water run-off into United States’ waters.

14



At this time, the ultimate regulatory test for defining WOTUS is unclear, and the determination therefor will be based upon the outcome of regulatory promulgations and associated litigation, that are currently pending. The manner in which WOTUS is defined could affect our operations by potentially increasing or modifying regulatory requirements governing our discharges. In 2015, the Clean Water Rule was promulgated, which would expand federal control over many U.S. water resources by broadening the definition of WOTUS, thereby potentially classifying a larger range of water resource types as jurisdictional under the Clean Water Act. Since promulgation of the 2015 Clean Water Rule, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers, or the Corps, have sought to rescind it and to promulgate a revised definition of WOTUS that would establish federal jurisdiction more narrowly, thereby reducing the scope of Clean Water Act applicability. To that end, on December 11, 2018, the EPA and the Corps proposed a rule to redefine WOTUS. Eventually, in October 2019, the 2015 Clean Water Rule was repealed, effectively reverting to the pre-2015 regulatory definition as of December 23, 2019. The EPA published a new Navigable Waters Protection Rule on April 21, 2020, which went into effect on June 22, 2020. This rule narrows the scope of wetlands and waterways under federal jurisdiction. The new rule has already been challenged in court in eight states and the District of Columbia. The Navigable Waters Protection Rule is currently in effect in every state and district except for Colorado, where a federal judge granted a stay. The scope of the WOTUS definition will likely remain fluid until litigation is finalized. To the extent that a regulation expands the scope of the jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act with respect to WOTUS, we could face increased costs and delays in obtaining permits under the Clean Water Act. Further, regulatory uncertainty may increase costs to our customers. 
Additionally, the Clean Water Act’s spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements require development of site-specific plans, and appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help contain and prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon storage tank release. The Clean Water Act also contains provisions that can prohibit development or require permitting before construction or expansion of a landfill may occur in areas designated as wetlands. Various states in which we operate or may operate in the future have been delegated authority to implement the Clean Water Act and its permitting requirements, and some of these states have adopted regulations that are more stringent than federal Clean Water Act requirements.
2.   Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA
Our United States E&P underground injection operations are subject to the SDWA, as well as analogous state laws and regulations. Under the SDWA, the EPA established the underground injection control, or UIC, program, which includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. Certain state regulations require us to obtain permits from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate our underground injection wells. Leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of our UIC permit, fines and penalties, the incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and potential liability to third parties for property damages. In July 2018, the EPA partnered with New Mexico to assess alternatives to immediate disposal of E&P wastewater by reusing it and/or treating it for reintroduction into the hydrologic cycle, as well as potential regulations related thereto. Moreover, in May 2019, EPA issued its draft Study of Oil and Gas Extraction Wastewater Management Under the Clean Water Act regarding EPA’s examination of whether to alter its regulation of the treatment and discharge of E&P wastewater. The final report was released in May 2020. The EPA has yet to determine its next steps for managing E&P wastewater under the Clean Water Act. If regulations requiring reuse or treatment are developed and implemented on a broad scale, it may increase our compliance costs or reduce the volume of E&P wastes that may be disposed of via underground injection.
3.   Canadian Water Protection Legislation
There is legislation in Canada at both the federal and provincial levels that protects water quality and regulates the discharge of substances into the aquatic environment. Federal water pollution control authority is derived primarily from the Fisheries Act, which contains provisions for the protection of water quality and fish habitat. This includes a general prohibition on the deposit of any deleterious substances into water that is frequented by fish, unless otherwise authorized. There is legislation in each provincial jurisdiction that also protects water sources and regulates water pollution, and generally requires an approval or permit for a discharge of any effluent, including in some cases stormwater, into a water body. For example, in Ontario, the Ontario Water Resources Act, or OWRA, prohibits the discharge of material of any kind into any water that may impair the quality of the water. The OWRA requires that an approval be obtained for the use 

15



and operation of certain sewage and stormwater works. Such approvals typically contain monitoring requirements and impose restrictions on effluent characteristics. Other provinces in Canada have similar regimes for the protection of water. If run-off or other contaminants from our landfills, transfer stations or other waste facilities is discharged or migrates into waters and causes impairment, we could face significant liability under provincial and federal laws.
C.   Air Emissions
1.   The Clean Air Act, or CAA
In the United States, the CAA generally regulates the emissions of air pollutants from a variety of sources, including certain landfills and oilfield waste facilities, based on factors such as the date of the construction and tons per year of emissions of regulated pollutants. Typically, federal requirements are delegated to the states and implemented at the state level. The CAA and analogous state laws require permits for and impose other restrictions on facilities and equipment that have the potential to emit pollutants into the atmosphere. Under the CAA, a source deemed to be a major source generally must be authorized by a permit. In those situations where major source permitting is not required, typically state laws and rules will require permitting as a type of minor source. Larger landfills and landfills located in areas where the ambient air does not meet certain air quality standards called for by the CAA may be subject to even more extensive air pollution controls and emissions limitations. In addition to the potential CAA permitting of landfill facilities, CAA permitting may be required for the construction of gas collection and flaring systems, composting and other operations. In some instances, federal operating permits may be required depending on the nature and volume of air emissions.
In addition to permitting, the CAA imposes other regulatory obligations, including, in some instances, performance standards on operations and equipment. The EPA has issued what are known as new source performance standards, or NSPS, and emissions guidelines, which impose requirements regarding control of landfill gases from new and existing large landfills. The EPA has also issued regulations imposing maximum achievable control technology, or MACT, on large MSW landfills. The MACT standards impose limits on landfill emissions and often require installation of landfill gas collection systems. The EPA published a final rule on March 26, 2020, which declined to amend the MACT at that time. Additional or more stringent regulations of our facilities may occur in the future, which could increase operating costs or impose additional compliance burdens. 
On August 29, 2016, the EPA issued “Subpart XXX” that applies to MSW landfills constructed, modified or reconstructed after July 17, 2014. The Subpart XXX NSPS reduce the non-methane organic compounds, or NMOC, emissions threshold at which MSW landfills must install emission controls, requires monitoring surface emissions of methane, monitoring of temperature and pressure at the wellhead of landfill gas collection systems and imposes other requirements. Further, the EPA promulgated “Guidelines” on August 29, 2016, known as Subpart Cf, which require states to implement similar requirements on existing landfills that are not subject to NSPS Subpart XXX. Subpart Cf updates existing Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for existing MSW landfills. The Subpart Cf Guidelines apply to landfills that accepted waste after November 8, 1987 and commenced construction or modification on or before July 17, 2014. Subpart XXX and Subpart Cf are intended to result in the reduction of landfill gas emissions, including methane, by lowering the thresholds at which a MSW landfill must install a gas collection and control system. Subpart Cf will ultimately affect existing sources that are not affected by Subpart XXX. In October 2018, the EPA proposed a rule to delay implementation of the Guidelines, and indicated that it was reconsidering certain portions thereof. The EPA is still in the process of reconsideration. In March 2020, the EPA finalized amendments to the most recent MSW Landfill NSPS and emission guidelines that would allow regulated entities to demonstrate compliance with landfill gas control, operating, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements by following the corresponding requirements in the MSW Landfills hazardous air pollutant regulations at Subpart AAAA. These amendments were intended to improve compliance and implementation of the regulations. EPA published its final rules on August 26, 2019, under which the deadline for states to submit their plans to implement the emission control requirements was extended from May 29, 2017 to August 30, 2021. Various groups are litigating this deadline extension in the D.C. Circuit. The rules also give EPA up to six months to review the completeness of state plans and an additional 12 months thereafter to approve or disapprove such plans. Regardless of the time extensions that the new rules allow, eventual compliance with these regulatory requirements could result in significant additional compliance costs, which we will incur in our ordinary course of business. In addition, state air regulatory requirements may impose additional restrictions beyond federal requirements, which could also result in 

16



compliance costs. For example, some state air programs uniquely regulate odor and the emission of certain specific toxic air pollutants.
The EPA recently modified, or is in the process of modifying, other standards promulgated under the CAA in a manner that could increase our compliance costs. For example, the EPA has discussed modifying national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) applicable to particulate matter, carbon monoxide and oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, ozone and other standards to make them more stringent. Current rule proposals retain 2015 NAAQS levels; a new administration, however, may propose more restrictive standards. It is possible these additional regulations could result in additional capital or operating expenditures. We do not believe, however, they will have a material adverse effect on our business as a whole. Further, our customers’ operations may be subject to existing and future CAA permitting and regulatory requirements that could have a material effect on their operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
2.   Canadian Air Quality Legislation
In Canada, the primary laws regulating air emissions from our operations come from provincial laws. Provincial laws may require approvals for air emissions and may impose other restrictions on facilities and equipment that have the potential to emit pollutants into the atmosphere. Provincial laws may require the construction of landfill gas management systems, including gas collection and flaring systems, which are subject to approvals or other regulatory requirements. Failure to obtain an approval or comply with approval requirements could result in the imposition of substantial administrative or regulatory penalties.
D.   Occupational Health and Safety
1.   The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, or the OSH Act
In the United States, the OSH Act is administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, and many state agencies whose programs have been approved by OSHA. The OSH Act establishes employer responsibilities for worker health and safety, including the obligation to maintain a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, comply with adopted worker protection standards, maintain certain records, provide workers with required disclosures, and implement certain health and safety training programs. Various OSHA standards may apply to our operations, including standards concerning notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work, the handling of asbestos and asbestos-containing materials and worker training and emergency response programs. Moreover, the Department of Transportation, OSHA, and other agencies regulate and have jurisdiction concerning the transport, movement, and related safety of hazardous and other regulated materials. In some instances, state and local agencies also regulate the safe transport of such materials to the extent not preempted by federal law.
2.   Canadian Occupational Health and Safety Laws
In Canada, each province establishes and administers a provincial occupational health and safety regime. Similar to the United States, these regimes generally identify the rights and responsibilities of employers, supervisors and workers. Employers are required to implement all prescribed safety requirements and to exercise reasonable care to protect employees from workplace hazards, among other things. Various occupational health and safety standards may apply to our Canadian operations, including requirements relating to communication of and exposure to hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work, the handling of asbestos and asbestos-containing materials and worker training and emergency response programs. In addition to the provincial departments of transportation, Transport Canada has jurisdiction to regulate the transportation of dangerous goods, which can include wastes.
E.   Additional Regulatory Considerations
We also review regulatory developments that may affect our business, including, among others, those described below.

17



1.   State, Provincial and Local Regulation
In addition to the federal statutes regulating our operations, each state or province where we operate or may operate in the future has laws and regulations governing the management, generation, storage, treatment, handling, transportation, and disposal of solid waste, E&P waste, occupational safety and health, water and air pollution and, in most cases, the siting, design, operation, maintenance, corrective action, closure and post-closure maintenance of landfills and transfer stations. Further, many municipalities have enacted or could enact ordinances, local laws and regulations affecting our operations, including zoning and health measures that limit solid waste management activities to specified sites or activities. Other jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” rules focusing on companywide and overall corporate compliance history in making permitting decisions. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted flow control provisions that direct or restrict the delivery of solid wastes to specific facilities, laws that grant the right to establish franchises for collection services and bidding for such franchises and bans or other restrictions on the movement of solid wastes into a municipality. Specific state and local permits for our operations may be required and may be subject to periodic renewal, modification or revocation by the issuing agencies. There has also been an increasing trend at the state, provincial and local levels to mandate and encourage waste reduction at the source and recycling, and to prohibit or restrict landfill disposal of certain types of solid wastes, such as food waste, yard waste, leaves, tires, electronic equipment waste, painted wood and other construction and demolition debris. The enactment of laws or regulations reducing the volume and types of wastes available for transport to and disposal in landfills could prevent us from operating our facilities at their full capacity.
2. Hydraulic Fracturing Regulation
We do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, but we do provide treatment, recovery, and disposal services for the fluids used and wastes generated by our customers in such operations. Recently, there has been increased public concern regarding the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect the environment, including drinking water supplies. Proposals have been made to enact separate federal, state or local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. Laws and regulations have been proposed and/or adopted at the federal, state and local levels that would regulate, restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing operations or require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Certain states and localities have placed moratoria or bans on hydraulic fracturing or the disposal of waste therefrom, or have considered the same.
In June 2016, the EPA promulgated a rule prohibiting discharges of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works, or POTWs. Further, the EPA promulgated regulations known as Reg. OOOO and Reg. OOOOa, which, among other things, require control of methane and volatile organic compound, or VOC, emissions related to certain well completions and certain tankage and equipment. Certain provisions of Reg. OOOOa are currently the subject of litigation. In June 2017, the EPA proposed a two-year stay of portions of the rules and in October 2018, the EPA proposed revisions to Reg. OOOOa. The EPA finalized its reconsideration of the OOOOa regulations in two rules, referred to as the “Review Rule” on September 14, 2020 and the “Reconsideration Rule” on September 15, 2020. These rules removed a segment of the E&P industry from OOOOa regulation and eliminated methane emission standards. While these revisions may reduce some regulatory burdens to the E&P industry, the rules continue to require regulated sites to monitor VOC emissions and undertake timely repairs. As such, the revisions may not materially reduce costs for our E&P customer base. Both rules have been challenged in court, and the incoming change in administration may prompt revisitation of these rules. Regardless of potential regulatory revisions, these rules can require oil and gas operators to expend material sums, which may reduce our customers’ E&P activities and could have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, several states have adopted or proposed laws and regulations analogous to or even more stringent than the federal rules that would remain in effect regardless of the outcome of any federal stay or litigation. Further, several states in which we conduct business require oil and natural gas operators to disclose information concerning their operations, which could result in increased public scrutiny.
The EPA has contemplated additional rule making. In May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or ANPR, under the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, seeking comment on whether and how the EPA should regulate the reporting or disclosure of the use of hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures and their constituents. Several states have implemented such requirements. Additionally, in December 2016, the EPA released a study on the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. In that study, the EPA found evidence that hydraulic fracturing activity can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, but data gaps limited the 

18



EPA’s ability to fully assess the matter. The EPA also published in May 2018 a detailed study of centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The study assessed the regulatory status of CWTs, characteristics of wastewaters discharged from them, available treatment technologies and associated costs. EPA has yet to implement regulations or guidelines based on this study. The impact of rules that the EPA is contemplating, has proposed or has recently promulgated will be uncertain until the rules are finalized and fully implemented.
If new federal, state or local laws, regulations or policies restricting hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly for our customers to perform hydraulic fracturing. Any such regulations limiting, prohibiting or imposing operational requirements on hydraulic fracturing could reduce oil and natural gas E&P activities by our customers and, therefore, adversely affect our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance.
3.   Disposal of Drilling Fluids
Certain of our facilities accept drilling fluids and other E&P wastes for disposal via underground injection. The disposal of drilling fluids is generally regulated at the state level, and claims, including some regulatory actions, have been brought against some owners or operators of these types of facilities for nuisance, seismic disturbances and other claims in relation to the operation of underground injection facilities. To date, our facilities have not been subject to any such litigation, but could be in the future.
4.   Climate Change Laws and Regulations
Generally, the promulgation of climate change laws or regulations restricting or regulating greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions could increase our costs to operate. The EPA’s current and proposed regulation of GHG emissions may adversely impact our operations. In 2009, the EPA made an endangerment finding allowing GHGs to be regulated under the CAA. The CAA requires stationary sources of air pollution to obtain New Source Review, or NSR, permits prior to construction and, in some cases, Title V operating permits. Pursuant to the EPA’s rulemakings and interpretations, certain Title V and NSR Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, permits issued on or after January 2, 2011, must address GHG emissions. As a result, new or modified emissions sources may be required to install Best Available Control Technology to limit GHG emissions. The EPA’s recently adopted Subpart XXX also requires the reduction of GHG emissions from new or modified landfills, and the Guidelines, known as Subpart Cf, published by the EPA in August 2016, will require the reduction of GHG emissions from existing landfills, although the EPA has delayed implementation of, and is reconsidering portions of, these regulations, as detailed above. In addition, the EPA’s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule sets monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements applicable to certain landfills and other entities.
In June 2018, the Canadian federal government enacted the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, which established a national carbon-pricing regime starting in 2019 for provinces and territories in Canada where there is no provincial regime in place or where the provincial regime does not meet the federal benchmark. Often referred to as the federal backstop, the federal carbon-pricing regime consists of a carbon levy that is applied to fossil fuels and an output-based pricing system (“OBPS”) that is applied to certain industrial facilities with reported emissions of 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2e”) or more per year. The carbon levy applies to prescribed liquid, gaseous, and solid fuels at a rate that is equivalent to $30 per tonne of CO2e in 2020, increasing annually, until it reaches $50 per tonne of CO2e by 2022. On November 19, 2020, the federal government introduced Bill C-12, the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which establishes the framework for national GHG emissions reduction targets to attain net-zero emissions by 2050. 
Certain states and several Canadian provinces have promulgated legislation and regulations to limit GHG emissions through requirements of specific controls, carbon levies, cap and trade programs or other measures. Comprehensive GHG legislation or regulation, including carbon pricing, affects not only our business, but also that of our customers.
Heightened regulation of our customers’ operations could also adversely affect our business. The regulation of GHG emissions from oil and gas E&P operations may increase the costs to our customers of developing and producing hydrocarbons and, as a result, may have an indirect and adverse effect on the amount of E&P waste delivered to our facilities. On June 3, 2016, the EPA promulgated NSPS Subpart OOOOa, which in conjunction with NSPS Subpart OOOO 

19



sets methane and VOC requirements for certain new and modified sources, including hydraulically fractured oil wells, certain tankage and equipment. Although, as discussed above, the EPA revised these regulations in September 2020, they are currently being challenged in court and they will continue to require, in some instances, additional emissions controls and increased capital costs for our customers, which could reduce their E&P activities, and subsequently negatively impact our business operations. As discussed above, certain states have enacted rules analogous to or even more stringent than the federal rules.
These statutes and regulations increase our costs and our customers’ costs, and future climate change statutes and regulations may have an impact as well. If we are unable to pass such higher costs through to our customers, or if our customers’ costs of developing and producing hydrocarbons increase, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. The impact of any potential rules affecting existing sources is uncertain.
5.   Flow Control/Interstate Waste Restrictions
Certain permits and state and local regulations, known as flow control restrictions, may limit a landfill’s or transfer station’s ability to accept waste that originates from specified geographic areas, to import out-of-state waste or wastes originating outside the local jurisdictions or to otherwise accept non-local waste. While certain courts have deemed these laws to be unenforceable, other courts have not. Certain state and local jurisdictions may seek to enforce flow control restrictions contractually. These actions could limit or prohibit the importation of wastes originating outside of local jurisdictions or direct that wastes be handled at specified facilities. These restrictions could limit the volume of wastes we can manage in jurisdictions at issue and also result in higher disposal costs for our collection operations. If we are unable to pass such higher costs through to our customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. Additionally, certain local jurisdictions have sought or may seek to impose extraterritorial obligations on our operations in an effort to affect flow control and may enforce tax and fee arrangements on behalf of such jurisdictions.
6. Potential Regulation of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) and Other Emerging Contaminants
At this time, several substances are being reviewed by governmental authorities for potential heightened regulation, including PFAS. PFAS, a class of man-made chemicals, have been in use since the 1940s and are found in many consumer products including textiles, fire suppressants, cookware, packaging, and plastics. These types of products and materials can be found in wastes that our facilities accept and have accepted for management and disposal. PFAS are environmentally persistent and tend to bioaccumulate in exposed populations. PFAS contamination has been found in the air, soil, and water, including drinking water. This contamination has prompted action by Congress, the EPA, and several states.
The EPA has begun to examine the potential regulation of PFAS materials under the SWDA, CERCLA, and TSCA. The EPA established lifetime health advisories for PFAS materials in May 2016. The regulatory development process for listing two PFAS chemicals, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), as hazardous substances under CERCLA was initiated in 2019. Listing PFAS as a CERCLA hazardous substance would potentially expand the universe of substances giving rise to cleanup liability. EPA has published Action Plans to potentially address the risk of PFAS contamination. The most recent Action Plan, which was published in February 2020, included preliminary determinations to regulate PFOA and PFOS, as well as an analysis of tools available to regulate PFAS. The EPA also released a memorandum in November 2020 detailing an interim strategy for including PFAS in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) waste water discharge permits under the CWA. 
The U.S. House of Representatives passed House Resolution 535 in January 2020. The bill specifically calls for the EPA to add PFAS to the list of hazardous air pollutants under the CAA and initiate regulatory limits for major and area sources of air pollutants. The bill, if it passes the Senate, will also establish PFAS effluent limitations and pretreatment standards for point sources under the CWA.
State governments are also beginning to regulate PFAS. Certain states have taken action to limit exposure to PFAS and require remediation of PFAS-related environmental contamination. Much of the state action has been directed at 

20



drinking water limits, but in some instances, bills and policies have included PFAS prohibitions in food packaging, consumer products, and firefighting products.
The EPA is also considering regulation of other contaminants of concern, including bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, which are common in PVC products. If the EPA moves forward with regulating these or other contaminants of concern, we may face higher compliance costs for, among other things, treatment of leachate and landfill gas.
PFAS chemicals have been the subject of environmental and health reviews by the federal government in Canada. Two PFAS chemicals, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are listed as toxic substances under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999. PFOS and PFOA are subject to stringent restrictions on their use in Canada, with additional restrictions pending. Environmental screening values and standards, and drinking water guidelines, exist in some jurisdictions in Canada in relation to some PFAS. Given the increasing concern regarding PFAS in the environment, including PFAS in groundwater and in leachate at waste disposal sites, increased regulatory requirements may be imposed in Canada in the future. 
Increased regulation of PFAS and other emerging contaminants could adversely affect our operations. Our already-substantial financial obligations associated with post-closure maintenance at our existing landfills may increase and accruals for these obligations may also need to be increased. Guidance calling for enhanced treatment of landfill leachate and landfill gas could potentially increase burdens for disposal of PFAS-containing materials generated by our facilities or accepted at our facilities, some of which may potentially need to be upgraded to accept PFAS-containing waste. Finally, regulation of PFAS as an air contaminant and/or waste water effluent pollutant could increase the cost to conduct our business, including, without limitation, potentially requiring greater capital expenditures to meet control requirements as well as operation and maintenance costs.
F.   Renewable and Low Carbon Fuel Standards
Pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA promulgated the Renewable Fuel Standards, or RFS, which require refiners to either blend “renewable fuels,” such as ethanol and biodiesel, into their transportation fuels or to purchase renewable fuel credits, known as renewable identification numbers, or RINs, in lieu of blending. In some cases, landfill gas generated at our landfills in the United States and Canada qualifies as a renewable fuel for which RINs are available. Such RINs can be sold by the Company. The price of RINs has been extremely volatile and the value of RINs is dependent upon a variety of factors. The EPA annually establishes the renewable fuel volumes required under the RFS for the following year. The 2020 renewable fuel and 2021 biomass-based diesel volume requirements were published on February 6, 2020, increasing required volumes from 2019 requirements. The regulation is being challenged judicially in the D.C. Circuit, but the challenge remains unresolved. Reductions or limitations on the requirement to blend renewable fuel would likely reduce the volume of RINs purchased to meet the RFS blending requirements. Further, there have been proposals to revise, and in some instances limit, the RFS program in the United States. As recently as October 2019, House Energy and Commerce Committee members, Representatives Shimkus and Flores, introduced the 21st Century Transportation Fuels Act that aims to eliminate volume-based renewable fuels mandates and instead rely upon the transition to a national octane standard and automobile manufacturing standards to govern fuel composition. This bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change in October 2019, but no further action has been taken. Various parties have also sought for the executive branch to revise the RFS. Limiting or eliminating the RFS could have the effect of reducing or eliminating the volume of RINs required to meet blending requirements, which could adversely affect the demand for RINS and accordingly the revenue stream we have historically derived from the sale of RINs. ‎
The Renewable Fuels Regulations under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 impose obligations on producers and importers of certain liquid petroleum fuels to acquire renewable fuel compliance units in connection with the fuels they produce or import. Compliance Units can be generated through the blending of renewable fuel into liquid petroleum fuels. Certain provincial jurisdictions in Canada also impose obligations to incorporate renewable fuels into fuels that are distributed within the jurisdiction. The Canadian federal government published the draft Clean Fuel Regulations under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 on December 19, 2020. The draft Clean Fuel Regulations would impose lifecycle carbon intensity requirements on producers and importers of certain liquid petroleum fuels, which could be satisfied, in part, through compliance credits generated through the supply of low carbon intensity 

21



fuels. The draft Clean Fuel Regulations are expected to come into force in December 2022. At this time, we do not know how the new Clean Fuel Regulations in Canada will impact demand for our renewable fuel in Canada. 
G.   Regulation of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Metals, or NORM
Certain states have enacted laws and regulations regulating NORM. In the course of our E&P waste operations, some of our equipment involved in E&P waste management and disposal may be exposed to naturally occurring radiation associated with oil and gas deposits. Further, certain E&P wastes we handle could be NORM contaminated. NORM wastes exhibiting levels of naturally occurring radiation exceeding established state standards are typically subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping, equipment and work area affected by NORM waste may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. It is possible that we may incur significant costs or liabilities associated with inadvertently handling NORM contaminated waste or equipment that becomes NORM contaminated based on exposure or contact with elevated levels of NORM.
H.   Extended Producer Responsibility, or EPR, Regulations
EPR regulations place responsibility on product manufacturers or suppliers to assume certain waste management or recycling responsibility for their products after such products’ useful life or otherwise impose obligations on product manufacturers or suppliers to reduce the volume of waste associated with their products.
EPR regulations have yet to be promulgated at the federal level in the United States, but have been promulgated or considered in state and local jurisdictions in the United States. EPR regulations could have an adverse effect on our business if enacted at the federal level or if widely enacted by state or local governments.
Numerous provincial jurisdictions in Canada have promulgated EPR and related waste diversion legislation and other programs that mandate or encourage recycling and waste reduction and restrict the landfill disposal of certain types of waste. The enactment of new and more stringent regulations reducing the types or volumes of wastes available for disposal in landfills could impact our future operations.
I.   State Public Utility Regulation
In some states, public authorities regulate the rates that landfill operators may charge. The adoption of rate regulation or the reduction of current rates in states in which we own or operate landfills could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
RISK MANAGEMENT, INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL SURETY BONDS
Risk Management
We maintain environmental and other risk management programs that we believe are appropriate for our business. Our environmental risk management program includes evaluating existing facilities and potential acquisitions for environmental law compliance. We do not presently expect environmental compliance costs to increase materially above current levels, but we cannot predict whether future acquisitions will cause such costs to increase. We also maintain a worker safety program that encourages safe practices in the workplace. Operating practices at our operations emphasize minimizing the possibility of environmental contamination and litigation. Our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable federal, state and provincial regulations.
Insurance
We maintain an insurance program for automobile liability, general liability, employer’s liability claims, environmental liability, cyber liability, employment practices liability and directors’ and officers’ liability as well as for employee group health insurance, property and workers’ compensation. Our loss exposure for insurance claims is generally limited to per incident deductibles or self-insured retentions. Losses in excess of deductible or self-insured retention levels are insured subject to policy limits.

22



Under our current Company-wide insurance program, we carry per incident deductibles or self-insured retentions ranging from $350,000 to $2 million for cyber liability and directors’ and officers’ liability claims. Additionally, we have umbrella policies with insurance companies for automobile liability, general liability and employer’s liability. Our property insurance limits are in accordance with the replacement values of the insured property. 
Under our current insurance program for our U.S. operations, we carry per incident deductibles or self-insured retentions ranging from $350,000 to $20 million for automobile liability claims, workers’ compensation and employer’s liability claims, general liability claims, employee group health insurance and employment practices liability, environmental liability, and for most property claims, subject to certain additional terms and conditions. Since workers’ compensation is a statutory coverage limited by the various state jurisdictions, the umbrella coverage is not applicable. Our environmental protection insurance policy covers all owned or operated landfills, certain transfer stations and other facilities, subject to the policy terms and conditions. From time to time, actions filed against us include claims for punitive damages, which are generally excluded from coverage under our liability insurance policies. Our policy provides insurance for new pollution conditions that originate after the commencement of our coverage. Pollution conditions existing prior to the commencement of our coverage, if found, could be excluded from coverage.
Under our current insurance program for our Canadian operations, we carry per incident deductibles or self-insured retentions ranging from $350,000 to $2.5 million for automobile liability claims, property claims and environmental liability. Since workers’ compensation is a provincial coverage limited by the various province jurisdictions, the umbrella coverage is not applicable. Employees are eligible to receive health coverage under Canada’s public health care system and, in addition, most employees of our Canadian operations are eligible to participate in group medical and drug coverage plans sponsored by us. Our environmental protection insurance policy covers all owned or operated landfills, certain transfer stations and other facilities, subject to the policy terms and conditions. Our policy provides insurance for new pollution conditions that originate after the commencement of our coverage. Pollution conditions existing prior to the commencement of our coverage, if found, could be excluded from coverage.
Financial Surety Bonds
We use financial surety bonds for a variety of corporate guarantees. The financial surety bonds are primarily used for guaranteeing municipal contract performance and providing financial assurances to meet asset closure and retirement requirements under certain environmental regulations. In addition to surety bonds, such guarantees and obligations may also be met through alternative financial assurance instruments, including insurance, letters of credit and restricted cash and investment deposits. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had provided customers and various regulatory authorities with surety bonds in the aggregate amount of approximately $727.4 million and $661.6 million, respectively, to secure our asset closure and retirement requirements and $482.3 million and $419.3 million, respectively, to secure performance under collection contracts and landfill operating agreements.
We source financial surety bonds from a variety of third-party insurance and surety companies, including a company in which we own a 9.9% interest that, among other activities, issues financial surety bonds to secure landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations for companies operating in the solid waste sector.
SEASONALITY
Based on historic trends, excluding any impact from the COVID-19 pandemic or an economic recession, we would expect our operating results to vary seasonally, with revenues typically lowest in the first quarter, higher in the second and third quarters and lower in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters. This seasonality reflects (a) the lower volume of solid waste generated during the late fall, winter and early spring because of decreased construction and demolition activities during winter months in Canada and the U.S., and (b) reduced E&P activity during harsh weather conditions, with expected fluctuation due to such seasonality between our highest and lowest quarters of approximately 10%. In addition, some of our operating costs may be higher in the winter months. Adverse winter weather conditions slow waste collection activities, resulting in higher labor and operational costs. Greater precipitation in the winter increases the weight of collected MSW, resulting in higher disposal costs, which are calculated on a per ton basis.
