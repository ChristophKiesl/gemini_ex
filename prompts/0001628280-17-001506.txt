Item 1.    Business.
Corporate Structure and Business
We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties under numerous brand names at different price and service points. Consistent with our focus on management, franchising, and licensing, we own very few of our lodging properties. We also operate, market, and develop residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations.
 We were organized as a corporation in Delaware in 1997 and became a public company in 1998 when we were “spun off” as a separate entity by the company formerly named “Marriott International, Inc.” We operate, franchise, or license 6,080 properties worldwide, with 1,190,604 rooms as of year-end 2016. We believe that our portfolio of brands is the largest and most compelling range of brands and properties of any lodging company in the world. The following table shows our principal brands:
As of year-end 2016, we group operations into three business segments: North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, and International. We provide financial information by segment and geography in Footnote 14 “Property and Equipment” and Footnote 18 “Business Segments.”
Acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide
On September 23, 2016 (the “Merger Date”), we completed the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC, formerly known as Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (“Starwood”) through a series of transactions (the “Starwood Combination”), after which Starwood became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Our Financial Statements and related discussions in this report include Starwood’s results of operations from the Merger Date through year-end 2016 and reflect the financial position of our combined company at December 31, 2016, except where we specifically state otherwise, such as certain statistics described under the caption “Performance Measures” in Part II, Item 7. We refer to our business associated with brands that were in our portfolio before the Starwood Combination as “Legacy-Marriott” and to the Starwood business and brands that we acquired as “Legacy-Starwood.” See Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information.
Company-Operated Properties
At year-end 2016, we operated 1,821 properties (521,552 rooms) under long-term management agreements with property owners, 48 properties (10,933 rooms) under long-term lease agreements with property owners (management and lease agreements together, the “Operating Agreements”), and 22 properties (9,906 rooms) that we own. In addition, we operated 
 2

under long-term management agreements 44 home and condominium communities (5,179 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations.
Terms of our management agreements vary, but we earn a management fee that is typically composed of a base management fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel, and an incentive management fee, which is based on the profits of the hotel. Our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations (both direct and indirect). Such agreements are generally for initial periods of 20 to 30 years, with options for us to renew for up to 50 or more additional years. Our lease agreements also vary, but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a percentage of annual revenues in excess of a fixed amount. Many of our Operating Agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners. A large number of our Operating Agreements also permit the owners to terminate the agreement if we do not meet certain performance metrics and financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured such deficiencies. In certain circumstances, some of our management agreements allow owners to convert company-operated properties to franchised properties under our brands.
For lodging facilities that we operate, we generally are responsible for hiring, training, and supervising the managers and employees who are needed to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies, and owners are required to reimburse us for those costs. We provide centralized reservation services and national advertising, marketing, and promotional services, as well as various accounting and data processing services, and owners are also required to reimburse us for those costs. 
Franchised, Licensed, and Unconsolidated Joint Venture Properties
We have franchising, licensing, and joint venture programs that permit other hotel owners and operators and two timeshare companies to use many of our lodging brand names and systems. Under our hotel franchising programs, we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees, which typically range from four to six percent of room revenues for all brands, plus two to three percent of food and beverage revenues for certain full-service hotels. We are a partner in unconsolidated joint ventures that manage and, in some cases, own hotels. Some of these joint ventures also provide services to franchised hotels. We recognize our share of these joint ventures’ net income or loss in the “Equity in earnings” caption of our Income Statements. Franchisees and certain joint ventures contribute to our national marketing and advertising programs and pay fees for use of our centralized reservation systems. 
We also receive royalty fees under license agreements with Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation (“MVW”), our former timeshare subsidiary that we spun off in 2011, and Vistana Signature Experiences, Inc. (“Vistana”), a subsidiary of Interval Leisure Group, Inc. (“ILG”), which acquired Starwood’s vacation timeshare operations before the Merger Date. MVW is the worldwide developer, marketer, and seller of vacation ownership and related products under the Marriott Vacation Club, Grand Residences by Marriott, and The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club brands. Vistana is the worldwide developer, marketer, seller, and manager of vacation ownership and related products under the Westin and Sheraton brands, and under the St. Regis and The Luxury Collection brands for certain existing properties. We receive license fees from both MVW and Vistana consisting of a fixed annual fee, adjusted for inflation, plus certain variable fees based on sales volumes.
MVW offers Marriott Rewards® Points and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards® Points, and Vistana offers SPG points, to their owners or potential owners as sales, tour, and financing incentives, in exchange for vacation ownership usage rights, for customer referrals, and to resolve customer service issues. MVW buys these points from our Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards programs and Vistana buys these points from our Starwood Preferred Guest program.
At year-end 2016, we had 4,006 franchised properties (614,405 rooms), 100 unconsolidated joint venture properties (13,106 rooms), and 83 licensed timeshare, fractional, and related properties (20,702 units).
Residential
We use or license our trademarks for the sale of residential real estate, typically in conjunction with hotel development, and receive branding fees for sales of such branded residential real estate by others. Third-party owners typically construct and sell residences with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. We have used or licensed our JW Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton, The Ritz-Carlton Reserve, W Hotels, The Luxury Collection, St. Regis, EDITION, Bulgari Hotels & Resorts, Marriott Hotels, Sheraton, Westin, and Autograph Collection Hotels brand names and trademarks for residential real estate sales. While the worldwide residential market is very large, we believe the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make residential properties bearing our trademarks distinctive.
 3

Seasonality
In general, business at company-operated and franchised properties fluctuates only moderately with the seasons and is relatively stable. Business at some resort properties may be seasonal depending on location.
Relationship with Major Customer
We operate a number of properties under long-term management agreements that are owned or leased by Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (“Host”). In addition, Host is a partner in several partnerships that own properties operated by us under long-term management agreements. See Footnote 20 “Relationship with Major Customer” for more information.
Intellectual Property
We operate in a highly competitive industry and our brand names, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos are very important to the sales and marketing of our properties and services. We believe that our brand names and other intellectual property have come to represent the highest standards of quality, caring, service, and value to our customers and the traveling public. Accordingly, we register and protect our intellectual property where we deem appropriate and otherwise protect against its unauthorized use.
Brand Portfolio 
We believe that our brand portfolio offers the largest and most compelling range of brands and properties in hospitality, offering two overall styles of hotels -- Classic and Distinctive -- each of which we group into three quality tiers: Luxury, Premium, and Select. 
Classic offers time-honored hospitality for the modern traveler.
Distinctive offers memorable experiences with a unique perspective.
Luxury offers bespoke and superb amenities and services. Our Luxury brand hotels include: JW Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton, W Hotels, The Luxury Collection, St. Regis, EDITION, and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts.
Premium offers sophisticated and thoughtful amenities and services. These hotel brands include: Marriott Hotels, Sheraton, Westin, Renaissance Hotels, Le Méridien, Autograph Collection Hotels, Delta Hotels, Gaylord Hotels, Marriott Executive Apartments, Marriott Vacation Club, Tribute Portfolio, and Design Hotels.
Select offers smart and easy amenities and services with our longer stay brands offering amenities that mirror the comforts of home. Our Select hotel brands include: Courtyard, Residence Inn, Fairfield Inn & Suites, SpringHill Suites, Four Points, TownePlace Suites, Aloft Hotels, AC Hotels by Marriott, Protea Hotels, Element Hotels, and Moxy Hotels.

Other Activities
Credit Card Programs. At year-end 2016, we licensed 13 credit card programs in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, and Japan, which include Marriott Rewards, The Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and Starwood Preferred Guest (“SPG”) credit cards. We earn licensing fees based on card usage, and the cards are designed to encourage loyalty to our brands.
Loyalty Programs, Sales and Marketing, and Reservation Systems. Our customer loyalty programs, Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and SPG (collectively “Loyalty Programs”), have 30 participating brands. MVW, Vistana, and other program partners also participate in one or more of our Loyalty Programs. The Loyalty Programs yield repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards, or airline miles with any of 49 participating airline programs. We believe that our Loyalty Programs generate substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels. In 2016, Loyalty Programs members purchased over 50 percent of our room nights. While we continue to run our Loyalty Programs in parallel, we encourage the linking of accounts between the Loyalty Programs, allowing instant elite status match, and enabling the transfer of points between the programs. We continue to enhance our Loyalty Program offerings and strategically market to this large and growing customer base. Our loyalty member base provides a low cost and high impact vehicle for our revenue generation efforts. See the “Loyalty Programs” caption in Footnote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information.
Marriott.com, Starwoodhotels.com, SPG.com, our international sites, and our mobile apps continued to grow significantly in 2016. Our web and mobile platforms allow for a seamless booking experience, and enable our guests to easily enroll in our Loyalty Programs and book our exclusive Member Rates. Our Look No Further® Best Rate Guarantee ensures best rate integrity, strengthening consumer confidence in our brand, and gives customers access to the same rates when they book through our various direct channels. We also continue to grow engagement levels with millions of customers through our mobile guest services. In addition to existing mobile services like mobile check-in and check-out, in 2016 we expanded to add mobile service requests, now offered at many hotel brands around the globe, enabling guests to engage in a two-way chat with the hotel before their arrival and throughout their stay. Our digital strategy continues to focus on creating a simple and efficient digital booking experience, and to create a superior and memorable stay experience for our guests powered by digital guest services across our hotel portfolio.
At year-end 2016, we operated 24 hotel reservation centers, nine in the United States and Canada and 15 in other countries and territories, which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide, including franchised properties. We own two of the U.S. facilities and either lease the others or share space with an existing Marriott property. While pricing is 
 8

set by our hotels, our reservation system manages inventory and allows us to utilize third party agents where cost effective. Economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room, drive profits for our owners and franchisees, and enhance our fee revenue.
We believe our global sales and revenue management organization is a key competitive advantage due to our unrelenting focus on optimizing our investment in people, processes, and systems. Our above-property sales deployment strategy aligns our sales efforts around the customer, reducing duplication of sales efforts by individual hotels and allowing us to cover a larger number of accounts. We also utilize innovative sophisticated revenue management systems, many of which are proprietary, which we believe provide a competitive advantage in pricing decisions, increase efficiency in analysis and decision making, and produce higher property-level revenue for the hotels in our system. Most of the hotels in our system utilize web-based programs to effectively manage the rate set up and modification processes which provides for greater pricing flexibility, reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance, and increases the speed to market of new products and services. 
As we further discuss in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” later in this report, we utilize sophisticated technology and systems in our reservation, revenue management, and property management systems, in our Loyalty Programs, and in other aspects of our business. We also make certain technologies available to our guests. Keeping pace with developments in technology is important for our operations and our competitive position. Furthermore, the integrity and protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to us as we use such data for business decisions and to maintain operational efficiency.
Environmental Responsibility and Sustainable Hotels. Our sustainability strategy supports business growth, conservation of natural resources, and protecting our planet through wide-reaching environmental initiatives. Marriott’s environmental goals are to: (1) reduce energy and water consumption by 20 percent from 2007 to 2020; (2) empower our hotel development partners to build sustainable hotels; (3) green our multi-billion dollar supply chain; (4) educate and inspire associates and guests to conserve and preserve; and (5) address environmental challenges through innovative conservation initiatives including rainforest protection and water conservation. 
We recognize our responsibility to reduce waste as well as water and energy consumption in our hotels and corporate offices. Our focus remains on continually integrating greater environmental sustainability throughout our business. In the year ahead, we intend to build upon our progress and launch our next generation of sustainability goals. We were the first major hotel chain to calculate our carbon footprint and launch a plan to improve energy efficiency, conserve water, and support globally significant projects that reduce deforestation. We use Energy and Environmental Action plans to help our properties achieve energy and water reduction goals. Working in partnership with the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) certification, Marriott is empowering our hotel development partners to build sustainable hotels. Marriott has one of the largest portfolios of LEED-certified buildings in the hospitality industry with 111 certified properties and over 180 more in the development pipeline.
Global Design Division. Our Global Design division provides design, development, construction, refurbishment, and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts. Similar to third-party contractors, Global Design provides these services on a fee basis to owners and franchisees of our branded properties.
Competition
We encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor. According to lodging industry data, there are approximately 1,044 lodging management companies in the United States, including approximately 20 that operate more than 100 properties. These operators are primarily private management firms, but also include several large national and international chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands. Management contracts are typically long-term in nature, but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if it does not meet certain financial or performance criteria.
During the last recession, demand for hotel rooms declined significantly, particularly in 2009, and we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency. Due to the competitive nature of our industry, we focused these efforts on areas that had limited or no impact on the guest experience. While demand trends globally improved from 2010 through 2016, cost reductions could again become necessary if demand trends reverse. We would expect to implement any such efforts in a manner designed to maintain customer loyalty, owner preference, and associate satisfaction, in order to help maintain or increase our market share.
Affiliation with a national or regional brand is common in the U.S. lodging industry, and we believe that our brand recognition assists us in attracting and retaining guests, owners, and franchisees. In 2016, approximately 60 percent of U.S. hotel rooms were brand-affiliated. Most of the branded properties are franchises, under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system. In the franchising business, we face a number of competitors that have

strong brands and customer appeal, including Hilton, Intercontinental Hotels Group, Hyatt, Wyndham, Accor, Choice, Carlson Rezidor, Best Western, La Quinta, and others.
Outside the United States, branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators, although branding is more common for new hotel development. We believe that chain affiliation will increase in many overseas markets as local economies grow, trade barriers decline, international travel accelerates, and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs.
Based on lodging industry data, we have more than a 14 percent share of the U.S. hotel market (based on number of rooms) and we estimate less than a four percent share of the lodging market outside the United States. We believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”) than our direct competitors in most market areas. We attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference. We believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities, our marketing programs, our reservation systems, and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction contribute to customer preference across all of our brands.
Properties that we operate, franchise, or license are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness. Most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds to be set aside, generally a fixed percentage of revenue, for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings. These ongoing refurbishment programs, along with periodic brand initiatives, are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the properties. Properties converting to one of our brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion.
Employee Relations
At year-end 2016, we had approximately 226,500 employees, approximately 23,000 of whom were represented by labor unions. We believe relations with our employees are positive.
Environmental Compliance
The properties we operate or develop are subject to national, state, and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment. Those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety; the use, management, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials. We believe that our operation and development of properties complies, in all material respects, with environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with such provisions has not materially impacted our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position, and we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact in the future.
