Item 1. BUSINESS
General
 Providing software solutions that empower wireless carriers and cable service providers to simplify and enhance the user experience of mobile consumers around the world is a mission that Smith Micro pursues with passion.  By providing mobile apps for digital family safety, carrier-grade voice messaging platforms and smart retail solutions, Smith Micro assists its carrier customers with building stronger, more profitable relationships with their mobile subscribers. Our solution portfolio is comprised of proven products that enable our customers to provide: 

• | In-demand digital services that connect today’s digital lifestyle, including family location services, parental controls, and consumer IoT devices to mobile consumers worldwide;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Easy visual access to voice messages on mobile devices through visual voicemail and voice-to-text transcription functionality; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strategic, consistent and measurable digital demo experiences that educate retail shoppers, create awareness of products and services and drive in-store sales, and optimize retail experiences with actionable analytics derived from in-store customer behavior.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We continue to innovate and evolve our business case in response to industry trends in order to capitalize upon growth opportunities in emerging markets, such as digital lifestyle services and online family safety, “Big Data” analytics, automotive telematics, and the consumer IoT marketplace. The key to our longevity, however, is not simply technological innovation, but our customer-first approach to doing business.
 Despite the global headwinds caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and significant investment in headcount additions, Smith Micro continued to thrive in 2020 as the business remained profitable and generated $7.9 million in cash from operations. To solidify our position as a leading white-label solution provider in the family safety market, we purchased the operator business of Circle Media Labs Inc. (“Circle”) – an acquisition that included multiple customer contracts and a perpetual source code license to Circle’s robust parental control software. Our development team spent the majority of 2020 integrating these features into our SafePath® platform, which enabled us to unveil the most comprehensive family safety offering on the market for wireless carriers in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. 
 The Company was incorporated in California in November 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in June 1995. Our principal executive offices are located at 5800 Corporate Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15237 and our telephone number is (412) 837-5300. Our website address is www.smithmicro.com, and we make our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Information contained on our website does not constitute a part of this Report. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “SMSI.”
 Business Segments
 We currently have one reportable operating segment: Wireless. 
 The wireless industry continues to undergo rapid change on all fronts as connected devices, mobile applications, and digital content are consumed by users who want information, high-speed wireless connectivity and entertainment, anytime, anywhere. While most of us think about being “connected” in terms of computers, tablets and smartphones, the consumer IoT market is creating a world where almost anything can be connected to the wireless internet. Wearable devices such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, pet trackers and GPS locators, as well as smart home devices, are now commonplace, enabling people, pets and things to be connected to the “Internet of Everything.” These devices have created an entire ecosystem of over-the-top (“OTT”) apps, while expanding how communication service providers can provide value to mobile consumers.

Although there are numerous business opportunities associated with pervasive connectivity, there are also numerous challenges, including:
  
• | The average age by which most children use smartphones and other connected devices continues to decrease. As such, parents and guardians must be proactive in managing and combating digital lifestyle issues such as excessive screen time, cyberbullying, and online safety;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Complexity, congestion, and spectrum scarcity plague wireless networks, making it difficult and expensive to satisfy the demand for mobile services by consumers and businesses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As IoT use cases continue to proliferate and scale, management complexity, security and interoperability must be addressed efficiently and correctly;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mobile network operators (“MNOs”) are being marginalized by messaging applications, and face growing competitive pressure from cable multiple system operators (“MSOs”) and others deploying Wi-Fi networks to attract mobile users;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enterprises face increasing pressure to mobilize workforces, operations, and customer engagement, but lack the expertise and technologies needed to leverage mobile technology securely and cost-effectively; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumers seek simpler network access and more personalized mobile experiences, while simultaneously demanding faster, cheaper, and more secure wireless services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To address these challenges, Smith Micro offers the multi-platform, modular solutions below.
 Products
 SafePath® – Comprised of SafePath Family, SafePath IoT, and SafePath Home, the SafePath product suite provides comprehensive and easy-to-use tools to protect digital lifestyles and manage connected devices both inside and outside the home. As a carrier-grade, white-label platform, SafePath empowers wireless service providers and cable operators to bring to market full-featured, on-brand family safety solutions that provide in-demand services to mobile subscribers such as location tracking, parental controls, and driver safety functionality. Delivered to end-users as value-added services, SafePath-based solutions activate new revenue streams for wireless service providers while helping to increase brand affinity and reduce subscriber churn.
 
CommSuite® – The CommSuite premium messaging platform helps mobile service providers deliver a next-generation voicemail experience to mobile subscribers, while monetizing a legacy cost-center. CommSuite Visual Voicemail (“VVM”) quickly and easily allows users to manage voice messages just like email or SMS with reply, forwarding and social sharing options. CommSuite also enables multi-language Voice-to-Text (“VTT”) transcription messaging, which facilitates convenient message consumption for users by reading versus listening. CommSuite is installed on more than 10 million mobile handsets and is available to both postpaid premium subscribers as well as prepaid subscribers.
 
ViewSpot® – Our retail display management platform provides wireless carriers and retailers with a way to bring powerful on-screen, interactive demos to life. These engaging demo experiences deliver consistent, secure and targeted content that can be centrally managed and updated via ViewSpot Studio. With the feature set provided by ViewSpot, wireless carriers and other smartphone retailers can easily customize and optimize the content loops displayed on demo devices so that it resonates with in-store shoppers. In 2020, ViewSpot was enhanced with new capabilities that enable consumers to navigate demo experiences in a touchless manner. This touchless functionality helps wireless carriers deliver in-store shopping experiences that are more aligned with current consumer expectations. The ViewSpot platform also offers powerful analytics capabilities that provide carriers with valuable insights into their consumer base and its buying behavior as well as their overall retail operations.

Legacy Graphics Business
 During fiscal 2020, we continued the process of winding down non-core product lines that began in fiscal 2019. As part of this effort, we sold our Moho and Motion Artist animation software products in December 2020. Our revenues still include an immaterial amount generated from our Graphics products, which are presented on a disaggregated basis in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, but such revenues are no longer reported as a separate industry segment. See Notes 10 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information related to our business segment and geographical information.
Marketing and Sales Strategy
 Because of our broad product portfolio, deep integration experience and flexible business models, we can quickly bring to market innovative solutions that support our customers’ needs to create new revenue opportunities and differentiate their products and services from their competitors.
 Our marketing and sales strategy is as follows:
 Leverage Operator Relationships. We continue to capitalize on our strong relationships with the world’s leading MNOs and MSOs. These customers serve as our primary distribution channel, providing access to hundreds of millions of end-users around the world.
 Focus on High-Growth Markets. We continue to focus on providing digital lifestyle solutions, analytics/Big Data solutions, premium messaging services, and visual retail content management solutions.  
 Expand our Customer Base. In addition to growing our business with current customers, we look to expand our MNO and MSO customers worldwide, as well as to expand into new partnerships as we extend the reach of our product platforms within the connected lifestyle ecosystem. 
Key Revenue Contributors
 In our Wireless business segment, we sell primarily to large wireless carriers, cable operators, and OEMs, so there are a limited number of actual and potential customers for our current products, resulting in significant customer concentration. Revenues attributable to T-Mobile (and Sprint prior to its merger with T-Mobile) and its affiliates accounted for 81% and 84% of the Company’s total revenues for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 On April 1, 2020, Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile (US), Inc. (“T-Mobile”) completed their previously announced merger transaction, with the combined company continuing to operate as T-Mobile. In connection with the Sprint/T-Mobile merger, on July 1, 2020, the combined company divested certain assets to DISH Network Corporation, including Sprint’s Boost Mobile pre-paid wireless services business (“Boost”). A portion of our solutions sales to Sprint/T-Mobile has historically included sales to Boost. The Company is working with T-Mobile and DISH on future product roadmaps and contract negotiations.
 Customer Service and Technical Support
 We provide technical support and customer service through our online knowledge base, email, and live chat. OEM customers generally provide their own primary customer support functions and rely on us for support to their technical support personnel.
Product Development
 The software industry, particularly the wireless market, is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in technology and user needs. We work closely with industry groups and customers, both current and potential, to help us anticipate changes in technology and determine future customer needs. Software functionality depends upon the capabilities of the related hardware. Accordingly, we maintain engineering relationships with various hardware manufacturers and we develop our software in tandem with their product development. Our engineering relationships with manufacturers, as well as with our major customers, are central to our product development efforts. We remain focused on the development and expansion of our technology, particularly in the wireless space. Our research and development

expenditures increased approximately 63% year over year, which is primarily a reflection of additional headcount-related expenses and external contract development costs to support continued product development.
 Competition
 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. These conditions create new opportunities for Smith Micro, as well as for our competitors, and we expect new competitors to continue to enter the market. We not only compete with other software vendors for new customer contracts, we also compete to acquire technology and qualified personnel.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the mobile software market include domain expertise, product features, usability, quality, price, customer service, speed to market and effective sales and marketing efforts. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors, there can be no assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. We also believe that the market for our software products has been and will continue to be characterized by significant price competition. A material reduction in the price we obtain for our products would negatively affect our profitability.
 Many of our existing and potential customers have the resources to develop products that compete directly with our products. As such, these customers may opt to discontinue the purchase of our products in the future. Our future performance is therefore substantially dependent upon the extent to which existing customers elect to purchase software from us rather than designing and developing their own software.
 Proprietary Rights and Licenses
 
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. We have United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. We will continue to apply for such protections in the future as we deem necessary to protect our intellectual property. We seek to avoid unauthorized use and disclosure of our proprietary intellectual property by requiring employees and third parties with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code.
 
Our MNO/MSO customers license our products through software license agreements or access our offerings through software as a service (“SaaS”) agreements. Our license agreements contain restrictions on reverse engineering, duplication, disclosure, and transfer, and our SaaS agreements contain restrictions on access and use.
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products and technology with the same functionality as our products and technology. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or take effective steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.
 Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 255 employees within the following departments: 186 in engineering and operations, 45 in sales and marketing, and 24 in management and administration. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relationships with our employees are good. Our strength and competitive advantage is – and always will be – people. We value the skills, strengths, and perspectives of our diverse team and will foster a participatory workplace that enables people to get involved in making decisions. The Company provides training and development opportunities to ensure that our employees are creative thinkers who are drive, focused and interested in ever-changing technology.
