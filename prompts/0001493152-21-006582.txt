Item 1. Business
Overview
 
QDs are nanoscale semiconductor crystals typically between 10 and 100 atoms in diameter. Approximately 10,000 would fit across the diameter of a human hair. Their small size makes it possible for them to exhibit certain quantum mechanical properties. QDs emit either photons or electrons when excited. In the case of photons, the wavelength (color) of light emitted varies depending on the composition and size of the quantum dot. As such, the photonic emissions can be tuned by the creation of QDs of different types and/or sizes. Their unique properties as highly efficient, next generation semiconductors have led to the use of QDs in a range of electronic and other applications, in the display and lighting industries. QDs also have applications in solar cells, where their characteristics enable conversion of light energy into electricity with the potential for significantly higher efficiencies and lower costs than existing technologies, thereby creating the opportunity for a step change in the solar energy industry through the use of QDs in printed photovoltaic cells.
 
QDs were first discovered in the early 1980s and the industry has developed to the point where QDs are now being used in an increasing range of applications, including televisions and displays, light emitting diode (“LED”) lighting (also known as solid-state lighting), and in the biomedical industry. LG, Samsung, and other companies have recently launched new televisions using QDs to enhance the picture color quality and power efficiency. A number of major lighting companies are developing product applications using QDs to create a more natural light for LEDs. The biomedical industry is using QDs in diagnostic and therapeutic applications; and applications are being developed to print highly efficient photovoltaic solar cells in mass quantities at a low cost.
 
QDs also have applications in solar cells, where their characteristics enable conversion of light energy into electricity with the potential for significantly higher efficiency than existing technologies. In traditional solar cells, a photon can only be converted into a fixed amount of energy per photon, regardless of the photon’s total energy. Excess energy is converted to heat which further lowers the efficiency of the panel. QD-based solar cells have the potential to significantly exceed this efficiency because QDs are capable of generating multiple electrons per photon strike rather than converting the extra energy of high energy photons to heat as in the case of traditional solar cells. QD solar cells can also convert the infrared portion of the spectrum that is not absorbed by traditional solar cells. These attributes make the theoretical maximum efficiency of QD solar cells substantially higher that of traditional silicon solar cells. We believe the use of QDs in solar cells will create the opportunity for a step change in efficiency and performance in printed photovoltaic cells.
 
A key challenge for the quantum dot industry has been and may continue to be its ability to scale up production volumes sufficiently to meet growing demand for QDs while maintaining product quality and consistency and reducing the overall costs of supply to stimulate new applications. QDs remain an expensive product, but we anticipate rapid growth of the QD market.
 
History of the Company
 
QMC was formed in January 2007, as a Nevada corporation under the name “Hague Corp.” and its shares began trading in the over-the-counter market in the fourth calendar quarter of 2008. The original business of Hague Corp. was the exploitation of mineral interests. Solterra, a Delaware corporation, was formed in May 2008 by Mr. Stephen Squires, our Chief Executive Officer, and other shareholders to develop quantum dot applications in the solar cell industry. Solterra was acquired by Hague Corp. in November 2008, pursuant to a merger transaction wherein the shareholders of Solterra exchanged their shares of common stock in Solterra for shares of common stock in Hague Corp., and Solterra became a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of Hague Corp. Upon the closing of the merger, Hague Corp. changed its business from the exploitation of minerals to the development of QDs, and subsequently changed its name to “Quantum Materials Corp.” in 2010.

In October 2008, Solterra also entered into a license agreement with the University of Arizona, which was later amended, (the “UA License”) pursuant to which Solterra has been granted exclusive rights to use the University of Arizona’s patented screen-printing techniques in the production and sale of organic light emitting diodes (“OLEDs”) incorporating QDs in printed electronic displays and other printed electronic components. This technology was developed at University of Arizona by Dr. Ghassan Jabbour, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors. In 2020, the Company determined that the U of A patented technology was not optimal for its printed solar cell product and developed its own solution.
 
In 2010, Solterra entered into an agreement with a third-party provider of industrial process equipment to develop a proprietary process for continuous flow production of QDs and TQDs under which Solterra retained all ownership and rights to the design and any related intellectual property. The development work has since been completed and the first two units have been delivered and placed into operation.
 
In 2013, the Company opened the Wet Lab in San Marcos, Texas at Star Park, an extension of Texas State University. In 2014, the first piece of manufacturing equipment was delivered to the Wet Lab. The capacity of the initial unit was approximately 250kg of QDs or TQDs per year and was intended to be used for internal research and development purposes although it also can be used for commercial production.
 
In 2014, the Company acquired a patent portfolio from Bayer AG that included patents and patent applications covering the high-volume manufacture of QDs, including heavy metal-free compositions, various methods for enhancing quantum dot performance, and a quantum dot based solar cell technology (the “Bayer Patents”).
 
The Bayer Patents, the UA License, organically developed technologies and our proprietary continuous flow manufacturing process comprise our fundamental asset platform. We believe that the intellectual property and proprietary technologies position the Company to become a leader in the overall nanomaterials and quantum dot industry, and a preferred supplier of high performance QDs and TQDs to an expanding range of applications.
 
In 2016, Mr. Squires returned as President and CEO and implemented a cost reduction initiative streamlining the G&A overhead and devoting more resources to R&D and commercialization readiness. These efforts have resulted in further optimization of the chemistry and the products. Through this refinement, we have been able to double the through put of our current production equipment from 2000 Kg of QDs per year to 4,000 Kg of QDs per year. All of our discoveries are purposely developed to be compatible with our patented flow manufacturing process. Management believes that this and a number of other material performance enhancement discoveries made by us provide us with the ability to provide industry leading material performance at a very competitive price point.
 
In 2019 the Company developed the QDX Ledger, which is based on technology acquired the blockchain-based technology assets of Capstan Platform, Inc. to provide an immutable, scalable and shared data store for consistent tracking and visibility among participants in a product supply chain. The identity and access credentials of participants, be they individuals, corporations or machines is also secured on the platform, providing mechanisms to control and restrict the supply of products as might be required by regulatory mandates and socially conscious business practices.
 
QDX Quantum Dots can be incorporated into almost any physical product so that its authenticity can be verified and tracked from point of manufacture through to sale to an end customer. Unlike existing approaches to establishing product identity, including QR code stickers and RFID tags, we believe that QDX Quantum Dots are more tamper proof, resistant to environmental extremes and low cost. We believe that they may be incorporated into products as diverse as auto parts, consumer electronics, apparel and luxury fashion accessories, industrial IoT devices, bank notes and even liquids, such as gasoline and lubricants.
 
In early 2020 and in the advent of the Covid 19 pandemic, the company recognized a need for a secure method for the validation and reporting of the Covid 19 testing process. The Company leveraged its existing QDX Ledger platform technology to launch the QDX HealthID later rebranded the QMC HealthID and is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Quantum Materials Corp.

Business Opportunities
 
The following outlines the business opportunities that the Company has pursued over the last few years:
 

● | Expanded range of quantum dot base materials to include carbon quantum dots, water soluble quantum dots, food grade quantum dots and IR emitting quantum dots. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Expanded the number of display optical film companies that we are now in collaboration with and increased sample deliveries; 
● | Continued product development with leading global optical film manufacturers; 
● | Established a nanomaterials laboratory facility for research, development and production in Texas. 

 
The Company can provide no assurances that its efforts to date will result in the grant of patents for proprietary processes or result in future sales and/or profitable operations.
 
A uniquely performing variant of QDs are TQDs, which have a molecular configuration consisting of a center portion and four arms extending from the center that are equally spaced in three dimensions. TQDs have material advantages over standard spherical QDs where both absorption of photons and charge transport are enhanced by the legs of the tetrapod which effectively serve as trillions of antennae for light. Their unique architecture and shape also promotes more uniform distances between the dots, which helps to eliminate the problem of aggregation. TQDs are more costly and difficult to produce in quantity using known methods, with the exception of our patented flow technology.
 
Initially, our principal business emphasis was on the development of tetrapod quantum dots (“TQDs”) for solar cell applications through Solterra. TQDs are a variant of QDs with material advantages over standard spherical QDs, particularly in solar panel applications. The solar cell market became increasingly volatile, with prices eroding due to the influx of subsidized products from outside the United States. We believe that we are well-positioned to bring a solar cell to market with sufficiently high conversion efficiency that, when combined with our low- cost proprietary manufacturing process, will result in a product capable of producing energy at a competitive cost per watt compared to existing solar cell technology and at a scale that will meet growing market demand for distributed, sustainable energy.

How Quantum Dots are Produced
 
High volume production of QDs is typically accomplished through one of several methods including:
 
Colloidal synthesis: Growth of QDs from precursor compounds dissolved in solutions, much like traditional chemical processes. This manual batch process requires careful control of temperature, mixing and concentration levels of precursor materials. Precise control must be maintained uniformly throughout the solution otherwise non-uniform, irregular QDs are produced. Due to their very small size it is extremely difficult if not impossible to segregate the QDs by size once they have been produced and a conglomeration of varied size QDs are not capable of producing the unique features that are required in most applications.
 
Prefabricated seed growth: QDs are created from chemical precursors in the presence of a molecular cluster compound under conditions whereby the integrity of the molecular cluster is maintained and acts as a prefabricated seed template. This manual batch method can produce reasonable quantities of QDs but can take significant capital resources to achieve significant volume and still results in low yields.
 
QMC’s automated continuous process: Unlike the more labor-intensive batch processes described above, we use a continuous manufacturing process to produce QDs and TQDs. We Believe that this patented process and chemistry provides advantages to other methods such as more precise control of process variables which leads to improved quality control. We believe that by using this method yields are higher and manufacturing costs are lower as compared to other methods. We also believe that we are the only company to successfully deploy continuous flow technology in the large-scale manufacturing of highly uniform QDs of both cadmium-based, cadmium-free and a number of other elemental chemistries.
 
Raw materials for the commercial production of QD are purchased in bulk from chemical supply companies. Indium, a component of our cadmium-free QD is considered a rare metal. Indium is primarily found in South America, Canada, Australia, China and the Commonwealth of Independent States. There is also a mature and efficient indium recycling process. While our management does not believe that a supply disruption of the indium-containing compounds used in the manufacturing of QDs represents a significant risk, no assurances can be given in this regard.
 
Major Market Segments


Life Sciences. The life sciences industry was one of the early areas of adoption of QD technology, especially for QDs used in fluorescent markers in diagnostic applications. This includes both the in vitro use of QDs for marking (illuminating) particular cell types or metabolic processes for understanding diseases, and in vivo imaging made possible by QD fluorescence in near infrared that can be detected in deep tissues. The fluorescent qualities of QDs provide an attractive alternative to traditional organic dyes in bio-imaging. It is estimated that QDs are 20 times brighter and 100 times more stable than standard fluorescent indicators. QD technology is also being used in place of colloidal gold nanoparticles in lateral flow test kits such as those used in the rapid Covid 19 antigen test. QDs have been reported in literature to exponential improve the sensitivity of these test enabling earlier detection.

TVs, Displays, and Other Optoelectronics. This market is comprised principally of quantum dot LCD displays (“QDLCDs”) for televisions, computers, cell phones, tablets and various other applications. In QDLCDs, QDs are used to down convert some of the blue light from the LED backlight directly to green and red light allowing for the creation of more vibrant colors and energy savings as compared to a traditional LCD TV/display. Unlike OLEDs which are extremely expensive to produce and require massive manufacturing capital expenditures, QD films are a drop-in solution for LCD manufacturers using existing infrastructure allowing for OLED-like color performance at significantly lower capital investment. LCD TVs make up the vast majority of new TV shipments, and we expect this proportion to grow. Samsung and several other OEMs are currently shipping televisions using QDs to enhance the color quality and power efficiency.
 
Lighting. In the lighting market, companies began to commercialize quantum dot LEDs in 2013 with significant R&D occurring among manufacturers of solid-state lighting. While companies have launched quantum dot LED lamps, the market for quantum dot LED lamps and the other lighting products is still relatively small. We believe QD-based LED lighting will be a highly competitive replacement for currently available compact florescent and LED lighting, as QD technology provides greater power efficiency and the ability to tune the light spectrum to emit light that is the most pleasing and/or appropriate for the application.
 
Solar Energy. QDs are capable of producing energy from a broad spectrum of solar and radiant energy, including the ultraviolet and infrared frequencies conventional silicon solar cells generally do not convert to electricity. QD solar cells have theoretical conversion potentials of approximately twice that of conventional solar cells, and applications are being developed to “print” highly efficient photovoltaic solar cells in mass quantities at low cost. Management believes that QD solar cells and panels will be the next evolutionary development in the field of solar energy. Management also believes that increased conversion efficiencies will be realized with the use of TQDs resulting from their unique shape and that our low-cost proprietary continuous production process and printing technology will permit Solterra to offer solar electricity solutions that can compete on a non-subsidized basis with the price of retail electricity in key markets around the world. We believe that global energy consumption trends that include the need for distributed energy generation (non-grid and especially in developing markets) and the desire for non-fossil fuel generated energy even at increased costs will drive market demand for solar. Management believes this will be especially true if existing generation by nuclear and coal is decommissioned due to age-related, safety, or environmental concerns or global governmental policy.
 
Other applications. Current and future applications of QDs and other nanoparticles may impact a broad range of other industrial markets. These potentially include batteries and energy storage, commercial glass, water purification, improved thermoelectric components, biohazard detection sensors, diode lasers, and others. We intend to monitor these uses as they mature from basic research and plan for specific compositions as market opportunities develop.
 
We anticipate that the biggest growth sectors for QDs will be in Life Science, anti-counterfeiting, and photovoltaics. Other current and potential applications for QD include nano-bio, commercial glass, batteries, sensors, lasers, and paints. QDs remain an expensive product. Although the high cost has slowed market growth, we believe the recent growth of mass manufacturing is quickly easing the cost constraints.
 
Current Position
 
Since January 2017, we have continued to fine-tune our operations. These efforts have enabled us to achieve the highest optical performance for cadmium free quantum dots in the company’s history. In addition, we have expanded the color range to now include the blue spectrum in addition to red and green spectrum. While achieving extraordinary performance is important, management believes that being able to produce these materials repeatedly and at a low price point is the formula for success, and we have made these performance improvements while also doubling throughput and further reducing production. We are now developing the infrastructure to support volume production.

Widespread, rapid adoption of quantum dots by various industries but specifically by the Life Science market may cause supply pressure that will need to be met with significant increases in available production capability. We are now in the process of building addition production capability in order to be better positioned to react to such demand. This production is anticipated to come online in the fourth quarter of 2021. We believe our low-cost high-volume manufacturing process is ideally positioned to meet these requirements. This is anticipated to be a key advantage to the Company to meet market demand and drive increased revenue.
 
The advantages and benefits of our automated production process and equipment are:



● | large scale and narrow nano bandwidth precision production with a compact footprint; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | less manpower and rapid production time utilizing advanced technologies allowing for cost savings; 
● | economies of scale leading to lower costs; 
● | high production yield with mimimal post-processing; 
● | Rapid R&D and improved quality control for higher uniformity; and 
● | assurance of backup reactor systems for continuous supply. 

Sales and Marketing Overview
 
During the past year, we have made significant progress in the development of QDs for use in anti-counterfeiting and Life Science applications. We are engaged with a leading nicotine delivery company developing a proof of concept for a unique authentication technology based on our food grade QDs. This is a funded POC that is scheduled to be complete by the third quarter of 2021. The company has also been developing Quantum Dot enabled lateral flow test kits using our proprietary Quantum Dot technologies. The initial focus is to use our technologies to enhance the sensitivity of the Covid 19 antigen test and to produce antibody test kit technologies that provide quantitative results. We have also developed a proof-of-concept Quantum Dot enabled Covid 19 test cassette with a photonic reader device that communicates directly with our QMC HealthID app in order to deliver an at home testing solution that will provide the highest possible test result and test reporting integrity without the presence of a third-party care giver. The technologies that we are developing for lateral flow test kits will also be applicable to a wide range of lateral flow test kits beyond Covid 19 and we are already exploring those opportunities.
 
Prior to the covid pandemic the Company entered into an agreement with QMVT in which QMVT would have access to technologies developed by the company that were mutually agreed to be ready for market and in which QMVT would develop that market and distribute the product. The initial focus was to be on a grow film for in door farming. With the advent of the pandemic the company shifted its primary focus to provide solution that would help address a number of challenges related to covid testing management and enhanced covid test kit technologies. The company and QMVT have agreed to dissolve the QMVT relationship and are currently in the process of negotiating the terms to do so.
 
Our discussions with Life Science companies provide strong evidence that the market opportunity is substantial and that our business plan is aligned with the customers’ product specification needs. While we are pursuing applications in several other markets as well, we believe that the Life Sciences and anti-counterfeiting represents the most substantial and most immediate opportunities. We further believe that our advantages in delivery of large volumes of high quality, narrow spectra, high performance QDs and other nanomaterials via our patented continuous production process makes us an attractive supplier. While we continue to pursue direct sales opportunities, we are also pursuing license agreements with strategic partners that can accelerate adoption in key verticals.
 
We believe that our recent move into the anti-counterfeiting market utilizing the QDX Quantum Ledger Blockchain Anti-counterfeiting platform is among the first in the quantum dot industry. Piracy and counterfeiting cost businesses more than $200 billion annually and account for the loss of more than 750,000 jobs in the US alone. Counterfeit drugs cost the global pharmaceutical industry approximately $18 billion in lost profits annually and according to Interpol, result in as many as one million deaths annually. QDs and other custom nanoparticles added to ink can be used to create unclonable unique “quantum fingerprints” for every package using current printing technology, and these “fingerprints” can be quickly verified utilizing a tokenized blockchain distributed ledger technology with a handheld device or optical in-line screening in manufacturing track and trace systems. Our plan is to be the industry innovative leader in this market space.
 
Although the development and launch of our QMC HealthID was part of our intended business trajectory, we were encouraged by the founder of the World Nano-foundation very early in the Covid pandemic to contribute our blockchain know how to provide a solution for a secure means to authenticate the entire testing process. We have now developed a complete solution that continues to evolve to meet specific customer workflows and now has an eco-system of test kit suppliers. While we remain very excited about the prospects for this product and see a number of uses beyond Covid we also recognize the need to rapidly gain broad adoption as the field of apps continues to grow and we believe this will lead to consolidation. We believe licensing this technology to a large Tech or Life Science company that has the reach and resources to achieve broad and rapid adoption is a desirable outcome and would enable Quantum Materials Corp. to re-invest into our core technologies and further expand our I.P. portfolio into the Life Science area.

Operational Overview
 
Our operations are located in San Marcos, Texas at the Star Park Technology Center, an extension of Texas State University (“TSU”). This location provides us with space for future expansion and with convenient access to TSU faculty and specialized laboratory facilities and equipment that can support joint research and development efforts with Texas State University. Located 30 miles south of Austin, Texas, the San Marcos facility is also in close proximity to a number of leading companies in the electronics, lighting, solar, and life sciences markets. The company is also exploring the possibility of relocating to a standalone facility that will better facilitate our ability to expand our Quantum Dot production, produce micro reactors and expand our R&D staff activities.
 
We are in the process of building 4 additional reactors in order to increase Quantum Dot production volumes and expand the range of Quantum Dot types we can produce at any one time.
 
We expect to commence generating revenues from licensing agreements, joint ventures and/or the production of materials at the San Marcos facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. In the event we secure a license agreement we anticipate an upfront licensing payment to the company with ongoing royalty payments. Revenues from materials manufactured by the company are expected to be modest at first and will be dependent upon our ability to generate purchase orders from development partners.
 
Our ongoing research and development functions are considered key to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position in the growing nanomaterials and QD market. Nanomaterials and QD technology continue to evolve, with new discoveries and refinements being made on an ongoing basis. We intend to be at the forefront of technological development and will focus a significant part of our efforts on this, as it has done historically. Continuing R&D activities at the San Marcos facility and our collaboration with Universities, and the numerous other research centers and departments with which we have relationships will be important aspects of the Company’s strategy. We are planning to increase our R&D efforts focused on Quantum Dot solar cell optimization and commercialization. Our license in India has indicated that the flooding and then the Covid 19 pandemic resulted in extraordinary delays in constructing the facilities in India. It was our intent to direct revenues from that project to accelerate our solar cell development. We are now better positioned to increase our investment in those technologies without relying solely on funds coming from India.
 
Our key assets include patents, proprietary high-volume process equipment technology, licenses and other intellectual property rights, our knowhow and the expertise, capabilities, and relationships brought to us by the Company by its management team. We are implementing a comprehensive patent strategy will put additional focus on building out our intellectual property portfolio and licensing rights.
 
The company has developed its own unique process for producing Quantum Dot solar cells and has determine that it will not be using the University of Arizona developed process. We believe our approach is less costly and helps us reduce any royalty stacking on our end product.
 
Our business is subject to various types of government regulations, including restrictions on the chemical composition of nanomaterials used in life sciences and other sensitive applications, the manufacture, transportation and export of chemical substances, and the regulation of hazardous materials used in or produced by the manufacture or use of QDs.
 
In fiscal year 2017, we applied for and received a Low Volume Exemption (“LVE”) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) which allows us to manufacture QD quantities of 10,000 kilograms or less per year in the United States. We also recently gained Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registration for QDX cadmium-free quantum dots through a division of the American Chemical Society and has also completed the requisite analysis in support of the QDX Safety Data Sheet (SDS). Both CAS and the SDS are required in order to ship high volumes of advanced materials abroad. Management believes that the patented (owned and licensed) processes and proprietary manufacturing equipment employed allow us to comply with current regulations. However, new regulations or requirements may develop that could adversely affect us and our products in the future. See “Risk Factors” section.

Employees
 
We have traditionally operated with limited resources and infrastructure. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we have 31 employees, 8 contractors, and 27 full time employees and the management team.
Competition
 
The commercial nanomaterials industry and more specifically, the quantum dot industry, is relatively young and undeveloped, with a number of small competitors attempting to establish themselves in different segments by employing one or more competitive strategies. We believe that competition among these companies is based on the following factors:

● | Product quality and performance characteristics: Manufacturers who will incorporate QDs in specific applications will carefully consider the quality, characteristics and physical properties of the QDs for efficacy in their targeted applications. This includes but is not necessarily limited to the following factors: the consistency of dots from batch to batch; resistance to degradation of performance characteristics by heat, oxygen, moisture, and luminous flux; brightness of emissions; purity of emissions; effective life spans; volume of dots necessary to produce the intended result; special characteristics such as dual emission capabilities; whether or not the QDs contain cadmium or other heavy metals or other hazardous compounds; the time needed to expand capacity; and the location of capacity relative to the manufacturer or ability to locate capacity nearby. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Volume: Before a manufacturer makes the commitment and dedicates capital and marketing resources to incorporate QDs in its end product, it must be confident that the volume of QDs it can obtain from a supplier will be sufficient to meet production needs in the short term and long term, including substantial growth following a successful new product launch. The strategies employed by a quantum dot company to scale production rapidly are critical to its attracting commercial users for its product, regardless of the quality of its QDs. 
● | Price: The price at which QDs can be delivered for incorporation into a new product will dictate the rate at which new applications can be developed and supported. High prices have historically restricted the market for QDs to only the highest value uses such as in the life sciences, while the potential for lower prices of supply appears to be opening many new markets. 
● | Continuing R&D and Product Improvements: Research and industry relationships are important to ensure a quantum dot company stays on the leading edge of technological development and commercialization. R&D is supported by collaboration with academic institutions or industrial companies. The Company spent $92,991 and $188,274 on research and development in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively, a decrease of $95,283. None of these costs were borne by customers. 

 
We believe we are well positioned in all four areas described above. We believe our wide range of QDs, including food grade, IR emitting and cadmium free QDs, meet or exceed our competitors’ offerings, and our patented continuous manufacturing process allows us to produce large volumes of precise nano wavelength QDs at competitive price points while also giving us the ability to quickly scale up capacity and locate it anywhere in the world it is needed. Lastly, our continuing relationships with universities private and public labs and our approach to joint development ventures should enable us to achieve and maintain a leading position in R&D and commercialization of new products.

The Company is subject to other competitive risks of early stage and commercial businesses generally, and of advanced technology businesses in particular, including competing in an environment where other companies may be better financed or have more experience than the Company.
 
Licenses and Intellectual Property
 
In 2010, we entered into an agreement with a third-party provider of industrial process equipment to develop proprietary equipment for continuous production of QDs under which we retained all ownership and rights to the design and any related intellectual property. We have made significant improvements to those designs and have now designed our own from proprietary micro-reactors with an increased range of capability, automation, scalability, and modularization. We believe the design of this new process equipment will position us to quickly and efficiently scale up mass production of a wider range of QDs for commercial sale. While we plan to work extensively with its current provider of equipment, we own all rights to the designs and intellectual property resulting from the development projects and could contract with one or more other competent suppliers of equipment or build the equipment in-house, if necessary.
Bayer Patents
 
In 2014, we acquired several patents and patent applications in five diverse sets of patent families from Bayer Technology Services GmbH, (the “Bayer Patents”). The Bayer Patents provide broad intellectual property protection for advances we have achieved in economical high-volume QD manufacturing. In addition, the Bayer Patents cover volume production technology for heavy metal-free QDs and nanoparticles; increasing quantum yields; heavy metal-free QDs; and hybrid organic quantum dot solar cell (“QDSC”) production as well as a surface modification process for increased efficiency of high-performance solar cells and printed electronics.
 
Agreement with University of Arizona
 
Solterra entered into an exclusive Patent License Agreement with the University of Arizona (“UA”) in July 2009. On November 22, 2017, Solterra memorialized prior oral agreements and entered into an amended license agreement with UA. The company has since determined that it will not use the subject I.P. and will be using a process technology developed entirely inhouse.
 
The Company entered into a Service Agreement with Texas State University (“TSU”) by which the Company occupies certain office and lab space at TSU’s STAR Park (Science Technology and Advanced Research) Facility. The agreement is month-to-month and can be terminated with 60-days written notice of either party.
 
Other Intellectual Property
 
The Company also owns additional intellectual property in the form of proprietary equipment designs, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, scientific and technical know-how, and “trade secrets” that it intends to further develop and apply in its business, seeking to protect same with appropriate governmental filings and/or secrecy agreements.
Governmental Approvals
 
Chemical substances manufactured in the Unites States in quantities of 10,000 kilograms or less per year are exempt from full premanufacture notice (“PMN”) review under section 5 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”). Low Volume Exemption (“LVE”) substances undergo a 30-day review. During fiscal year 2017, we applied for and received an LVE.
