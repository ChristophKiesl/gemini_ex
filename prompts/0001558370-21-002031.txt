Item 1.    Business
Magellan Health, Inc. (“Magellan”) provides managed care services for some of the most complex areas of healthcare. The Company offers innovative solutions that combine analytics, technology and clinical rigor to drive better decision making, positively impact members’ health outcomes and optimize the cost of care for the customers Magellan serves. The Company provides services to health plans and other managed care organizations (“MCOs”), employers, labor unions, various military and governmental agencies and third-party administrators (“TPAs”). Magellan operates three segments: Healthcare, Pharmacy Management and Corporate. In this report, references to “we”, “us”, “our” and the “Company” include Magellan and its subsidiaries. Magellan was incorporated in 1969 under the laws of the State of Delaware. 
Business Developments
Sale of the MCC Business
On December 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our Magellan Complete Care business (the “MCC Business”) to Molina Healthcare, Inc. (“Molina”), pursuant to a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2020, by and between the Company and Molina, for cash in the amount of $850 million plus closing adjustments of $158 million (subject to post-closing adjustments, if any), and the assumption by Molina of liabilities of the MCC Business (the “MCC Sale”). The MCC Business was the Company’s business of contracting with state Medicaid agencies and the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to manage total medical benefits or long-term support services for Medicaid and dual eligible Medicaid and Medicare populations.
​
Pending Merger with Centene Corporation
On January 4, 2021, the Company and Centene Corporation (“Centene”) entered into an Agreement of Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Centene, and Mayflower Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware 

1




corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Centene (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving such merger (the “Merger”) as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centene. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each issued and outstanding share of the Company’s common stock will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive $95.00 in cash. The Company expects to complete the transaction in the second half of 2021.
​
The Merger has been approved by both the Company’s board of directors and the board of directors of Centene. The completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, the required approval of Magellan’s stockholders and the receipt of various regulatory approvals. For additional information on the Merger Agreement and the Merger, please refer to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 4, 2021, and our definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on February 19, 2021 (the “Proxy Statement”). The Company cannot guarantee that the Merger will be completed on a timely basis or at all or that, if completed, it will be completed on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement.
​
For additional information regarding the Merger, including associated risks and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors, Part II, Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14 “Subsequent Events” in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
​
Recent Healthcare Acquisitions
In recent years, the Company has expanded its Healthcare segment with various acquisitions and strategic investments. The acquisition of a 70 percent majority interest in Aurelia Health, LLC and its subsidiary Michael B. Bayless, LLC (collectively “Bayless”) in December 2020 expanded Magellan’s capabilities as a provider of outpatient primary care and behavioral health. Also during 2020, the Company made strategic minority investments in Kaden Health and Neuroflow which are technology-enabled companies designed to enhance the Company’s capabilities. Magellan also increased its presence within the federal marketplace through the acquisition of Armed Forces Services Corporation (“AFSC”) in 2016 which falls under the Behavioral & Specialty Health reporting unit.
Recent Pharmacy Management Acquisitions
In recent years, the Company has expanded its Pharmacy Management segment with various acquisitions. The acquisitions of Partners Rx Management, LLC (“Partners Rx”) in 2013, 4D Pharmacy Management Systems, Inc. (“4D”) in 2015 and Veridicus Holdings, LLC (“Veridicus”) in 2016 expanded the Company’s presence in the PBM market. The Company expanded its formulary management programs with the acquisition of CDMI, LLC (“CDMI”) in 2014. 
Healthcare
The Healthcare segment (“Healthcare”) previously consisted of two reporting units – Behavioral & Specialty Health and Magellan Complete Care (“MCC”). As a result of the sale of the MCC Business to Molina, the Healthcare segment now only includes Behavioral and Specialty Healthcare reporting unit. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented reflect the MCC business as discontinued operations. See Note 9—“Discontinued Operations” for additional information.
The Behavioral & Specialty Health reporting unit’s customers include health plans, accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), employers, the United States military and various federal government agencies for whom Magellan provides carve-out management services for (i) behavioral health, (ii) employee assistance plans (“EAP”) and (iii) other areas of specialty healthcare including diagnostic imaging, musculoskeletal management, cardiac and physical medicine. These management services can be applied broadly across commercial, Medicaid and Medicare populations, or on a more targeted basis for our health plans and ACO customers. The Behavioral & Specialty Health reporting unit also includes Magellan’s carve-out behavioral health contracts with various state Medicaid agencies, as well as certain provider assets that deliver primary care and behavioral healthcare services through an integrated approach. 
The MCC business, which is now reflected as discontinued operations, contracted with state Medicaid agencies and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to manage care for beneficiaries under various Medicaid and Medicare programs. MCC managed a wide range of services from total medical cost to carve out long-term support services. MCC largely focused on managing care for more acute special populations including individuals with serious mental illness (“SMI”), dual eligibles, aged, blind and disabled (“ABD”) and other populations with unique and often 

2




complex healthcare needs. 
Magellan’s coordination and management of these healthcare and long-term support services are provided through its comprehensive network of medical and behavioral health professionals, clinics, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home care agencies and ancillary service providers. This network of credentialed providers is integrated with clinical and quality improvement programs to improve access to care and enhance the healthcare experience for individuals in need of care, while at the same time making the cost of these services more affordable for our customers. In addition to the Company’s provider assets where it provides treatment services in certain geographies, the Company also employs licensed behavioral health counselors to deliver non-medical counseling under certain government contracts.
The Company provides its Healthcare management services primarily through: (i) risk-based contractual arrangements, where the Company assumes all or a substantial portion of the responsibility for the cost of providing treatment services in exchange for a fixed per member per month (“PMPM”) fee, or (ii) administrative services only (“ASO”) contractual arrangements, where the Company provides services such as utilization review, claims administration and/or provider network management, but does not assume full responsibility for the cost of the treatment services, in exchange for an administrative fee and, in some instances, a gain share.
Pharmacy Management
The Pharmacy Management segment (“Pharmacy Management”) is comprised of services that provide clinical and financial management of pharmaceuticals paid under both the medical and the pharmacy benefit. Pharmacy Management’s customer solutions include: (i) pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) services, including pharmaceutical dispensing operations and Medicare Part D; (ii) pharmacy benefit administration (“PBA”) for state Medicaid and other government sponsored programs; (iii) clinical and formulary management programs; (iv) medical pharmacy management programs; and (v) programs for the integrated management of specialty drugs across both the medical and pharmacy benefit that treat complex conditions, regardless of site of service, method of delivery, or benefit reimbursement.
These services are available individually, in combination, or in a fully integrated manner. The Company markets its pharmacy management services to managed care organizations, employers, third party administrators, state governments, Medicare Part D, and other government agencies, exchanges, brokers and consultants. In addition, the Company will continue to upsell its pharmacy services to its existing customers and market its pharmacy solutions to the Healthcare customer base, including through integrated Pharmacy Management and Healthcare service offerings. 
Pharmacy Management contracts with its customers for services using risk-based, gain share or ASO arrangements. In addition, Pharmacy Management provides services to the Healthcare segment for most of the MCC business.
On May 11, 2020, the Company announced its decision to exit the Medicare Part D business at the end of 2020. The Company will retain its Medicare Employer Group Waiver Plan as well as full capabilities to serve the PBM needs of its existing and prospective Medicare customers.
Corporate
This segment of the Company is comprised primarily of amounts not allocated to the Healthcare and Pharmacy Management segments that are largely associated with costs related to being a publicly traded company. 
See Note 12—“Business Segment Information” to the consolidated financial statements for certain segment financial data relating to our business set forth elsewhere herein.
Industry
According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), national health expenditure growth is expected to average 5.4 percent annually over 2019-2028. Growth in national health spending is projected to be faster than projected growth in Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) by 1.1 percentage points over 2019-2028. As a result, the report projects the health share of GDP to rise from 17.7 percent in 2018 to 19.7 percent by 2028.

With the dynamic economic environment, rising healthcare costs, increased fiscal pressures on federal and state governments and the uncertainty around the future of healthcare reform, healthcare spending will continue to be one of the greatest pressing issues for the American public and government agencies. The rapidly evolving clinical and technological environment demands the expertise of specialized healthcare management services to provide both high-quality and affordable care.
Business Strategy
Magellan is executing on a strategy that focuses on meeting market demands for our customers, improving health outcomes for our members, and creating value for our shareholders. We are confident that our strategy will improve our effectiveness, expand our margins and position us to reinvest in the business to drive sustainable long-term growth. The Company’s strategy is organized around four key areas of focus:

1. | Deliver on our commitments;

​
Customer Contracts
The Company’s contracts with customers typically have terms of one to three years, and in certain cases contain renewal provisions (at the customer’s option) for successive terms of between one and two years (unless terminated earlier). Substantially all of these contracts may be immediately terminated with cause and many of the Company’s contracts are terminable without cause by the customer or the Company either upon the giving of requisite notice and the passage of a specified period of time (typically between 30 and 180 days) or upon the occurrence of other specified events. In addition, the Company’s contracts with federal, state and local governmental agencies generally are conditioned on legislative appropriations. These contracts generally can be terminated or modified by the customer if such appropriations are not made. The Company’s contracts for managed healthcare and specialty solutions services generally provide for payment of a per member per month fee to the Company. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk-Based Products” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Reliance on Customer Contracts.”
The Company has significant concentrations of business for managed behavioral health services with various counties in the State of Pennsylvania (the “Pennsylvania Counties”) which are part of the Pennsylvania Medicaid Program, with members under its Medicare Part D contract with CMS, and with various agencies and departments of the United States federal government. See further discussion related to these significant customers in “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Reliance on Customer Contracts.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Dependence on Government Spending” for discussion of risks to the Company related to government contracts.

Provider Network
The Company’s managed healthcare services are primarily provided by a contracted network of third-party providers. The number and type of providers in a particular area depend upon customer preference, site, geographic concentration and demographic composition of the beneficiary population in that area. The Company’s network consists of approximately 170,000 healthcare providers providing various levels of care nationwide. The Company’s network providers are almost exclusively independent contractors located throughout the local areas in which the Company’s customers’ beneficiary populations reside. Outpatient network providers work out of their own offices, although the Company’s personnel are available to assist them with consultation and other needs.
Non-facility network providers typically execute standard contracts with the Company under which they are generally paid on a fee-for-service basis.
The Company contracts with facilities on a per diem or fee-for-service basis and, in some limited cases, on a “case rate” or capitated basis. The contracts between the Company and inpatient and other facilities typically are for one-year terms and are terminable by the Company or the facility upon 30 to 120 days notice.
The Company also provides capability to support client-specific networks. Many of the Company’s clients have their own contracted networks. The Company establishes and administers these private networks segregating and reporting to the clients. In addition, the Company can lease networks on behalf of specific entities in order to enhance coverage. 
The Company also has a national network of contracted retail pharmacies which is offered to its pharmacy benefit management customers. We contract with and manage these pharmacies to optimize drug cost and member access to fill covered prescriptions. Pharmacies can work with us both electronically and telephonically at the point of service for member eligibility, claim adjudication and member cost share, if applicable.
Competition
The Company’s business is highly competitive. The Company competes with insurance companies and other healthcare organizations, including health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”), TPAs, independent practitioner associations (“IPAs”), multi-disciplinary medical groups, PBMs, healthcare information technology companies and other specialty healthcare and managed care companies. Many of the Company’s competitors, particularly certain insurance companies, HMOs, technology companies and PBMs are significantly larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than the Company, and some of the Company’s competitors provide a broader range of services. The Company competes based upon quality and reliability of its services, a focus on clinical excellence, product and service innovation and proven expertise across its business lines. The Company may also encounter competition in the future from new market entrants. In addition, some of the Company’s customers that are managed care companies may seek to provide specialty managed healthcare services directly to their members, rather than subcontracting with the Company for such services. Because of these factors, the Company does not expect to be able to rely to a significant degree on price increases to achieve revenue growth and anticipates continued pricing pressures.
Insurance
The Company maintains a program of insurance coverage for a broad range of risks in its business. The Company has renewed its general, professional and managed care liability insurance policies with unaffiliated insurers for a one-year period from June 17, 2020 to June 17, 2021. The general liability policy is written on an “occurrence” basis, subject to a $0.25 million per claim un-aggregated self-insured retention. The professional liability and managed care errors and omissions liability policies are written on a “claims-made” basis, subject to a $1.0 million per claim ($5.0 million per anti-trust claim and $10.0 million per class action claim) un-aggregated self-insured retention for managed care errors and omissions liability, and a $0.25 million per claim un-aggregated self-insured retention for professional liability.
The Company maintains a separate general and professional liability insurance policy with an unaffiliated insurer for its specialty pharmaceutical dispensing operations. The specialty pharmaceutical dispensing operations insurance policy has a one-year term for the period June 17, 2020 to June 17, 2021. The general liability policy is written 

5




on an “occurrence” basis and the professional liability policy is written on a “claims-made” basis, subject to a $0.05 million per claim and $0.25 million aggregated self-insured retention.
The Company is responsible for claims within its self-insured retentions, and for portions of claims reported after the expiration date of the policies if they are not renewed, or if policy limits are exceeded. The Company also purchases excess liability coverage in an amount that management believes to be reasonable for the size and profile of the organization.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Professional Liability and Other Insurance,” for a discussion of the risks associated with the Company’s insurance coverage.
Regulation
General
The Company’s operations are subject to extensive and evolving state and federal laws and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. This includes applicable federal and state laws and regulations in connection with its role in providing pharmacy benefit management; behavioral health benefit management; radiology benefit management; utilization review; customer employee benefit plan services; pharmacy; healthcare services; Medicaid; Medicare; health insurance, and laws and regulations impacting its federal government contracts. 
Regulation of the healthcare industry as well as government contracting is constantly evolving, with new legislative enactments and regulatory initiatives at the state and federal levels being implemented on a regular basis. Consequently, it is possible that a court or regulatory agency may take a position under existing or future laws or regulations, or as a result of a change in the interpretation thereof that such laws or regulations apply to the Company in a different manner than the Company believes such laws or regulations apply. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be repealed or modified. Such changes may require significant alterations to the Company’s business operations in order to comply with such laws or regulations, or interpretations thereof. Expansion of the Company’s business to cover additional geographic areas, to serve different types of customers, to provide new services or to commence new operations could also subject the Company to additional licensure requirements and/or regulation. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
State Licensure and Regulation
The Company is subject to certain state laws and regulations governing the licensing of insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs, TPAs, PBMs, pharmacies and companies engaged in utilization review. In addition, the Company is subject to state laws and regulations concerning the licensing of healthcare professionals, including restrictions on business corporations from providing, controlling or exercising excessive influence over healthcare services through the direct employment of physicians, psychiatrists or, in certain states, psychologists and other healthcare professionals. These laws and regulations vary considerably among states, and the Company may be subject to different types of laws and regulations depending on the specific regulatory approach adopted by each state to regulate the managed care and pharmaceutical management businesses and the provision of healthcare treatment services.
Further, certain regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the Company possess discretionary powers when issuing or renewing licenses or granting approval of proposed actions such as mergers, a change in ownership, and certain intra-corporate transactions. One or multiple agencies may require as a condition of such license or approval that the Company cease or modify certain of its operations or modify the way it operates in order to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or policies. In addition, the time necessary to obtain a license or approval varies from state to state, and difficulties in obtaining a necessary license or approval may result in delays in the Company’s plans to expand operations in a particular state and, in some cases, lost business opportunities.
The Company has sought and obtained licenses as a utilization review agent, single service HMO, TPA, PBM, Pharmacy, discount prescription drug plan, PPO, HMO and Health Insurance Company in one or more jurisdictions. The company owns a majority interest in an entity that holds several outpatient treatment center licenses and one counseling facility license in Arizona. Numerous states in which the Company does business have adopted regulations governing entities engaging in utilization review. Utilization review regulations typically impose requirements with respect to the qualifications of personnel reviewing proposed treatment, timeliness and notice of the review of proposed treatment and 

6




other matters. Many states also license TPA activities. These regulations typically impose requirements regarding claims processing and payments and the handling of customer funds. 
Some states require TPA licensure for PBM entities as a way to regulate the PBM lines of business. Other states regulate PBMs through a PBM specific license. The Company has obtained these licenses as required to support the PBM business. In some cases, single purpose HMO or insurance licenses are required for the Company to take risk on business in that state. Some states require PPO or other network licenses to offer a network of providers in the state. Almost all states require licensure for pharmacies dispensing or shipping medications into the state. The Company has obtained all of these necessary licenses.
To the extent that the Company operates or is deemed to operate in some states as an insurance company, HMO, PPO or similar entity, it may be required to comply with certain laws and regulations that, among other things, may require the Company to maintain certain types of assets and minimum levels of deposits, capital, surplus, reserves or net worth. Being licensed as an insurance company, HMO or similar entity could also subject the Company to regulations governing reporting and disclosure, coverage, mandated benefits, rate setting, grievances and appeals, prompt pay laws and other traditional insurance regulatory requirements.
Regulators in a few states have adopted policies that require HMOs or, in some instances, insurance companies, to contract directly with licensed healthcare providers, entities or provider groups, such as IPAs, for the provision of treatment services, rather than with unlicensed intermediary companies. In such states, the Company’s customary model of contracting directly is modified so that, for example, the IPAs (rather than the Company) contract directly with the HMO or insurance company, as appropriate, for the provision of treatment services.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has developed a “health organizations risk-based capital” formula, designed specifically for managed care organizations, that establishes a minimum amount of capital necessary for a managed care organization to support its overall operations, allowing consideration for the organization’s size and risk profile. The NAIC also adopted a model regulation in the area of health plan standards, which could be adopted by individual states in whole or in part, and could result in the Company being required to meet additional or new standards in connection with its existing operations. Certain states, for example, have adopted regulations based on the NAIC initiative, and as a result, the Company has been subject to certain minimum capital requirements in those states. Certain other states, such as Maryland, Texas, New York, Florida and New Jersey, have also adopted their own regulatory initiatives that subject entities, such as certain of the Company’s subsidiaries, to regulation under state insurance laws. This includes, but is not limited to, requiring adherence to specific financial solvency standards. State insurance laws and regulations may limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends, make certain investments and repay certain indebtedness.
Regulators may impose operational restrictions on entities granted licenses to operate as insurance companies or HMOs. For example, the California Department of Managed Health Care has imposed certain restrictions on the ability of the Company’s California subsidiaries to fund the Company’s operations in other states, to guarantee or cosign for the Company’s financial obligations, or to pledge or hypothecate the stock of these subsidiaries and on the Company’s ability to make certain operational changes with respect to these subsidiaries. In addition, regulators of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries may exercise certain discretionary rights under regulations including, without limitation, increasing its supervision of such entities or requiring additional restricted cash or other security.
Failure to obtain and maintain required licenses typically also constitutes an event of default under the Company’s contracts with its customers. The loss of business from one or more of the Company’s major customers as a result of an event of default or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Licensure requirements may increase the Company’s cost of doing business in the event that compliance requires the Company to retain additional personnel to meet the regulatory requirements and to take other required actions and make necessary filings. Although compliance with licensure regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the Company, there can be no assurance that specific laws or regulations adopted in the future would not have such a result.
The provision of healthcare treatment services by physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, pharmacists and other providers is subject to state regulation with respect to the licensing of healthcare professionals. The Company believes that the healthcare professionals, who provide healthcare treatment on behalf of or under contracts with the Company, and the case managers and other personnel of the health services business, are in compliance with the applicable state licensing requirements and current interpretations thereof. Regulations imposed upon healthcare providers include but 

7




are not limited to, provisions relating to the conduct of, and ethical considerations involved in, the practice of medicine, psychiatry, psychology, social work and related behavioral healthcare professions, radiology, pharmacy, privacy, accreditation, state corporate practice of medicine doctrines, state telemedicine laws, health care facility licensure, fee-splitting rules government healthcare program participation requirements, reimbursements for patient services, Medicare, Medicaid, federal and state laws governing fraud, waste and abuse and, federal and state laws relating to self-referrals, anti-kickback, false claims, and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. In certain cases, the common law or statutory duty to warn others of danger or to prevent patient self-injury or the statutory duties to report matters of abuse or neglect of individuals. However, there can be no assurance that changes in such requirements or interpretations thereof will not adversely affect the Company’s existing operations or limit expansion. To the extent that the Company is or is deemed to be engaged in the provision of healthcare treatment services, the Company may be subject to medical malpractice claims and other tort claims related to the provision of such services.
With respect to the Company’s employee assistance crisis intervention program, additional licensing of clinicians who provide telephonic assessment or stabilization services to individuals who are calling from out-of-state may be required if such assessment or stabilization services are deemed by regulatory agencies to be treatment provided in the state of such individual’s residence. The Company believes that any such additional licenses could be obtained. In California, the Company’s employee assistance programs are regulated by the California Department of Managed Health Care. This subjects the Company to regulations governing reporting and disclosure, coverage, mandated benefits, grievances and appeals and other traditional insurance regulatory requirements.
The corporate practice of medicine laws of some states limit the ability of a business corporation to directly provide, control or exercise excessive influence over healthcare services through the direct employment of physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, or other healthcare professionals, who are providing direct clinical services. In addition, the laws of some states prohibit physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, or other healthcare professionals from splitting fees with other persons or entities. These laws and their interpretations vary from state to state and enforcement by the courts and regulatory authorities may vary from state to state and may change over time. There can be no assurance that the Company’s existing operations and its contractual arrangements with physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists and other healthcare professionals will not be successfully challenged under state laws prohibiting fee splitting or the practice of a profession by an unlicensed entity, or that the enforceability of such contractual arrangements will not be limited. The Company believes that it could, if necessary, restructure its operations to comply with changes in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, and that such restructuring would not have a material adverse effect on its operations.
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”)
Certain of the Company’s services are subject to the provisions of ERISA. ERISA governs certain aspects of the relationship between employer-sponsored healthcare benefit plans and certain providers of services to such plans through a series of complex laws and regulations that are subject to periodic interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”). In some circumstances, and under certain customer contracts, the Company may be expressly named as a “fiduciary” under ERISA, or be deemed to have assumed duties that make it an ERISA fiduciary, and thus be required to carry out its operations in a manner that complies with ERISA in all material respects. In other circumstances, particularly in the administration of pharmacy benefits, the Company does not believe that its services are subject to the fiduciary obligations and requirements of ERISA. In addition, the DOL has not yet finalized guidance regarding whether discounts and other forms of remuneration from pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to be reported to ERISA-governed plans in connection with ERISA reporting requirements.
Numerous states require the licensing or certification of entities performing TPA or PBM activities; however, certain federal courts have held that such licensing requirements are preempted by ERISA. ERISA preempts state laws that mandate employee benefit structures or their administration, as well as those that provide alternative enforcement mechanisms. The Company believes that its TPA and PBM activities performed for its self-insured employee benefit plan customers are exempt from otherwise applicable state licensing or registration requirements based upon federal preemption under ERISA and have relied on this general principle in determining not to seek licenses for certain of the Company’s activities in some states. Existing case law is not uniform on the applicability of ERISA preemption with respect to state regulation of PBM and/or TPA activities. In some states, the Company has licensed its self-funded pharmacy related business as a TPA or PBM after a review of state regulatory requirements and case law. There can be no assurance that additional licenses will not be required with respect to utilization review or TPA and/or PBM activities 

8




in certain states.
Some of the state regulatory requirements described herein may be preempted in whole or in part by ERISA, which provides for comprehensive federal regulation of employee benefit plans. However, the scope of ERISA preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings. In this regard, in a December 2020 decision, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Rutledge v. Pharmaceutical Care Management Association that ERISA does not pre-empt state rate or cost regulations that do not force plans to adopt particular benefit coverage. The Rutledge decision does not address other issues apart from rate regulations, however and so the Company could be subject to overlapping federal and state regulatory requirements with respect to certain of its operations and may need to implement compliance programs that satisfy multiple regulatory regimes. There can be no assurance that continuing ERISA compliance efforts or any future changes to ERISA, or the interpretation of ERISA, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and Other Privacy Regulation
HIPAA contains standards relating to the transmission, privacy and security of health information by healthcare providers and healthcare plans. Confidentiality and patient privacy requirements are particularly strict in the Company’s behavioral managed care business. 
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), passed as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, represented a significant expansion of the HIPAA privacy and security laws. 
HIPAA generally does not preempt state law. Therefore, because many states have privacy laws that provide more stringent privacy protections than those imposed by HIPAA, the Company must address privacy issues under those state laws as well. 
In addition to HIPAA and the HITECH Act, the Company is also subject to federal laws and regulations governing patient records involving substance abuse treatment, as well as other federal privacy laws and regulations. 
The European Union (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became effective May 25, 2018. The Company believes its exposure to the GDPR is at present limited to EAP services to US-based companies that decide to offer EAP to their EU-based employees, which is a very small subset of the Company’s EAP line of business. The Company does not market its EAP services within the EU or to persons in the EU or compete for business with countries solely established in jurisdictions subject to GDPR, or monitor the behavior of persons in the EU, and its EAP contracts with its customers are entered into in the United States with companies either US-established or not solely established in jurisdictions subject to GDPR. When a US customer chooses to make EAP services available to EU-based employees, the EAP services are managed through an EU-based subcontractor and EAP personal data subject to the GDPR processed by that subcontractor does not leave the EU. The Company has received contractual assurances from its subcontractor of the subcontractor’s compliance with the GDPR. Thus, the Company does not believe the GDPR at present poses material compliance risks for the Company. However, there can be no assurances that the GDPR could not be interpreted by EU supervisory authorities or courts in a manner that would require the Company to restructure its EAP services in the EU, or the GDPR could be changed or interpreted in a manner causing material adverse impact on the Company. The Company has not yet determined its legal risks under UK privacy laws post-Brexit.
Fraud, Waste and Abuse Laws
The Company is subject to federal and state laws and regulations protecting against fraud, waste and abuse. Fraud, waste and abuse prohibitions cover a wide range of activities, including kickbacks and other inducements for referral of members or the coverage of products, billing for unnecessary services by a healthcare provider and improper marketing. Companies involved in public healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud, waste and abuse, and are often subject to audits. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the Company in relation to these programs are complex and subject to change.
The federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute (the “Anti-Kickback Statute”) prohibits, among other things, an entity from paying or receiving, subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors,” any remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce the referral of individuals covered by federally funded healthcare programs, or the purchase, or the arranging for or recommending of the purchase, of items or services for which payment may be made in whole, or in part, under 

9




Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE or other federally funded healthcare programs. Sanctions for violating the Anti-Kickback Statute may include imprisonment, criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in the federally funded healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted broadly by courts, the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) and other administrative bodies.
Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibits physicians, subject to certain exceptions described below, from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services” in which the physician, or an immediate family member, has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician, or an immediate family member, has entered into a compensation arrangement. These prohibitions, contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, commonly known as “Stark II,” amended prior federal physician self-referral legislation known as “Stark I” by expanding the list of designated health services to a total of 11 categories of health services. The professional groups with which we are affiliated provide one or more of these designated health services. Persons or entities found to be in violation of the Stark Law are subject to denial of payment for services furnished pursuant to an improper referral, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
Many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the Anti-Kickback Statute and, in more limited instances, the Stark Law, that are not limited to services for which Medicare or Medicaid payment is made. In addition, most states have statutes, regulations, or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in exchange for making referrals. These laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. In states that have enacted these statutes, we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law as persuasive. 
It also is a crime under the Public Contracts Anti-Kickback Act, for any person to knowingly and willfully offer or provide any remuneration to a prime contractor to the United States, in order to obtain favorable treatment in a subcontract. Violators of this law also may be subject to civil monetary penalties. There have been a series of substantial civil and criminal investigations and settlements over the last several years in connection with alleged kickback schemes.
The federal civil monetary penalty (“CMP”) statute provides for civil monetary penalties for any person who provides something of value to a beneficiary covered under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid, in order to influence the beneficiary’s choice of a provider. ERISA, to which certain of our customers’ services are subject, generally prohibits any person from providing to a plan fiduciary a remuneration in order to affect the fiduciary’s selection of or decisions with respect to service providers. Unlike the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, ERISA regulations do not provide specific safe harbors and its application may be unclear.
The Federal Civil False Claims Act imposes civil penalties for knowingly making or causing to be made false claims with respect to government contracts and governmental programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, for services not rendered, or for misrepresenting actual services rendered, in order to obtain higher reimbursement. Private individuals may bring qui tam or whistleblower suits under the Federal Civil False Claims Act, which authorizes the payment of a portion of any recovery to the individual bringing suit. 
Further, pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is also a per se violation of the Federal Civil False Claims Act. The Federal Civil False Claims Act generally provides for the imposition of civil penalties and for treble damages, resulting in the possibility of substantial financial penalties for small billing discrepancies. Criminal provisions that are similar to the Federal Civil False Claims Act provide that a corporation may be fined if it is convicted of presenting to any federal agency a claim or making a statement that it knows to be false, fictitious or fraudulent. Even in situations where the Company does not directly provide services to beneficiaries of federally funded health programs and, accordingly, does not directly submit claims to the federal government, it is possible that the Company could nevertheless become involved in a situation where false claim issues are raised based on allegations that it caused or assisted a government contractor in making a false claim.
The Company is subject to certain provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (the “Act”). The Act requires entities that receive $5 million or more in annual Medicaid payments to establish written policies that provide detailed information about the Federal Civil False Claims Act and the remedies thereunder, as well as any state laws pertaining to civil or criminal penalties for false claims and statements, the “whistleblower” protections afforded under such laws, and the role of such laws in preventing and detecting fraud, waste and abuse. 

10




The Company is also subject to The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”). Under the law, those with independent knowledge of a financial fraud committed by a business required to report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) may be entitled to a percentage of the money recovered. Included in Dodd-Frank are provisions which protect employees of publicly traded companies from retaliation for reporting securities fraud, fraud against shareholders and violation of the SEC rules/regulations. Dodd-Frank also amends the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”) and Federal Civil False Claims Act to expand their whistleblower protections. 
Many states have laws and/or regulations similar to the federal fraud, waste and abuse laws described above. Sanctions for violating these laws may include injunction, imprisonment, criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in the state Medicaid programs. The Company has a corporate compliance and ethics program, policies and procedures and internal controls in place designed to ensure that the Company conducts business appropriately. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to scrutiny or challenge under such laws or regulations and that any such challenge would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Mental Health Parity
The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity Act of 2008 (“MHPAEA”) establishes parity in financial requirements (e.g., co-pays, deductibles, etc.) and treatment limitations (e.g., limits on the number of visits) between mental health and substance abuse benefits and medical/surgical benefits for health plan members. The law applies to ERISA plans, Medicaid managed care plans and State Children’s Health Insurance Program (“SCHIP”) plans. On November 13, 2013 the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services issued Final Rules on the MHPAEA (“Final Rules”). The Final Rules include some concepts not included under the statute including the requirement to conduct the parity review at the category level within the plan, introducing the concept of non-quantitative treatment limitations and prohibiting separate but equal deductibles. The Company believes it is in compliance with these requirements. In March 2016, CMS promulgated a final rule on the application of parity to Medicaid Managed Care Plans, CHIP and alternative benefit plans. The Company believes it is in compliance with these requirements. On December 7, 2016, the Congress adopted the Twenty-First Century Cures Act, which codified some concepts in the Final Rules. The Consolidated Appropriations Bill, effective December 27, 2020 contained some new reporting requirements related to mental health parity that are effective February 10, 2021. The Company’s risk contracts allow for repricing to occur effective the same date that any legislation/regulation becomes effective if that legislation/regulation is projected to have a material effect on cost of care.
Health Care Reform
The ACA is a broad and sweeping piece of legislation creating numerous changes in the healthcare regulatory environment. Some of the regulations interpreting the ACA, most notably the Medical Loss Ratio regulations, the Internal Claims and Appeals and External Review Processes Regulations and Health Insurance Exchanges have an impact on the Company and its business. Others, such as the regulation on dependent coverage to age 26 and coverage of preventative health services, could impact the nature of the members that we serve and the utilization rates. Medicaid expansion under the ACA has had some impact on the Company’s Medicaid business. The Company has customers that are participating in the state and federal Health Insurance Exchanges. The Company has taken necessary steps to support our customers in their administration of these plans.
Federal and State Medicaid Laws and Regulations
The Company directly contracts with various states to provide Medicaid services to states. In addition, the Company directly contracts with various states to provide Medicaid managed care services to state Medicaid beneficiaries. As such, it is subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations affecting Medicaid as well as state contractual requirements. In addition to state regulation, certain Medicaid contracts require the Company to maintain Medicare Advantage special needs plan status, which is regulated by CMS. 
The Company also is a sub-contractor to health plans that provide Medicaid managed care services to state Medicaid beneficiaries. In the Company’s capacity as a subcontractor with these health plans, the Company is indirectly subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations as well as contractual requirements pertaining to the operation of this business. If a state or a health plan customer determines that the Company has not performed satisfactorily as a 

11




subcontractor, the state or the health plan customer may require the Company to cease these activities or responsibilities under the subcontract. While the Company believes that it provides satisfactory levels of service under its respective subcontracts, the Company can give no assurances that a state or health plan will not terminate the Company’s business relationships insofar as they pertain to these services.
On April 16, 2019 CMS promulgated a final rule to revise the Medicare Advantage (MA) program (Part C) regulations and Prescription Drug Benefit program (Part D) regulations to implement certain provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018; improve quality and accessibility; clarify certain program integrity policies for MA, Part D, and cost plans and PACE organizations; reduce burden on providers, MA plans, and Part D sponsors through providing additional policy clarification; and implement other technical changes regarding quality improvement. This final rule revises the appeals and grievances requirements for certain Medicaid managed care and MA special needs plans for dual eligible individuals to implement certain provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.
​
May 1, 2020 (CMS–9115–F) – Per CMS, “This final rule which is intended to move the health care ecosystem in the direction of interoperability, and to signal our commitment to the vision set out in the 21st Century Cures Act and Executive Order 13813 to improve the quality and accessibility of information that Americans need to make informed health care decisions, including data about health care prices and outcomes, while minimizing reporting burdens on affected health care providers and payers.”
​
On November 13, 2020, CMS promulgated a final rule advances CMS' efforts to streamline the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) managed care regulatory framework and reflects a broader strategy to relieve regulatory burdens; support state flexibility and local leadership; and promote transparency, flexibility, and innovation in the delivery of care. These revisions of the Medicaid and CHIP managed care regulations are intended to ensure that the regulatory framework is efficient and feasible for states to implement in a cost-effective manner and ensure that states can implement and operate Medicaid and CHIP managed care programs without undue administrative burdens.”
​
Interoperability Rule 
In April 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a final rule on interoperability and patient access to health data to provide patients access to their electronic health information. In the final Interoperability and Patient Access rule, CMS states that a core policy principal in the final rule is that all Americans should be able, without special effort or advanced technical skills, to see, obtain, and use all electronically available information that is relevant to their health, care, and choices – of plans, providers, and special treatment options. 
​
Under the final rule, Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, state Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) agencies, Medicaid and CHIP managed care plans, and qualified health plan (QHP) issuers in the federally-facilitated exchanges (FFEs) (referred to herein as “CMS-regulated health insurers/payers”) must meet certain requirements regarding patient access to their health care information, including requirements related to application programming interfaces (APIs). The effective date of these API requirements is January 1, 2021 for all payers, except QHP issuers/payers in FFEs. For QHPs in FFEs, the API requirements are effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. However, CMS will not exercise enforcement regarding these provisions until July 1, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to provide additional flexibility to payers.
​
CMS-regulated health insurers/payers are required to implement, test and maintain a secure, standards-based application programming interface (API) that permits third-party applications to retrieve, with the approval/permission and direction of the individual/patient, the individual’s claims and encounter information, including cost, as well as a defined sub-set of their clinical information through third-party applications of their choice. CMS-regulated plans/payers must also implement and maintain a publicly accessible standards-based API that maintains a complete and accurate directory of contracted providers which is updated within 30 calendar days of a payer receiving provider directory information or an update to the provider directory information. Since Magellan is not a CMS-regulated payer, but is a first tier, downstream or related entity (FDR) or a subcontractor to health plan customers who are CMS-regulated payers, in such instances where Magellan maintains data that falls under the rule on behalf of a CMS-regulated payer/health plan customer, Magellan is collaborating with such health plans to ensure that the required data is provided to the health plans accordingly and in a timely fashion. 

12




Transparency Rule
On October 29, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury issued a final rule which requires most group health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to disclose price and cost-sharing information for all items and services to participants and enrollees. The cost-sharing information requirements under the rule take effect in a phased approach beginning January 1, 2023. In addition to providing personalized cost-sharing information, health plans and health insurers must also publicly disclose in-network provider negotiated rates and historical out-of-network allowed amounts starting January 1, 2022. Many of the rule’s requirements apply directly to Magellan clients which are group health plans and health insurance issuers. The rule provides that health plans and insurers may contract with vendors (including third-party administrators, pharmacy benefit managers, and utilization review agents like Magellan) to support these disclosure requirements; however the plans and insurers remain responsible for compliance with the requirements. Clients may seek Magellan’s assistance in complying with certain information disclosure requirements in the rule. Magellan will work with impacted clients to address the implications of the rule and its implementation.  
In connection with its PBM business, the Company negotiates rebates with and provides services for drug manufacturers. The manufacturers are subject to Medicaid “best price” regulations requiring essentially that the manufacturer provide its deepest level of discounts to the Medicaid program. In some instances, the government has challenged a manufacturer’s calculation of best price and we cannot be certain what effect, if any, the outcome of any such investigation or proceeding will have on our ability to negotiate favorable terms.
Medicare Laws and Regulations
The Company is contracted with CMS as a Prescription Drug Plan (“PDP” or “Part D Plan”) to provide health services and prescription drug benefits to Medicare beneficiaries within employer group health plans. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the Company and other participants in Medicare programs are complex and subject to change. CMS regularly audits the performance of contracted health plans to determine compliance with contracts and CMS regulations, and to assess the quality of services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. CMS penalties for noncompliance include premium refunds, civil monetary penalties, prohibiting a company from continuing to market and/or enroll members in the company’s Medicare products, contract termination, and exclusion from participation in federally funded healthcare programs and other sanctions. 
​
 The Company is also a subcontractor to health plans that are Medicare Advantage Organizations and PDPs. In the Company’s capacity as a subcontractor with these health plans, the Company administers benefits to Medicare beneficiaries and is indirectly subject to certain federal laws and regulations, as well as contractual requirements pertaining to the operation of this business. If CMS or a health plan customer determines that the Company has not performed satisfactorily as a subcontractor, CMS or the health plan customer may require the Company to cease these activities or responsibilities under the subcontract. While the Company believes that it provides satisfactory levels of service under its respective subcontracts, the Company can give no assurances that CMS or a health plan will not terminate the Company’s business relationships with respect to these services.
​
CMS requires PDPs to report all price concessions received for PBM services. The applicable CMS guidance requires PDPs to contractually require the right to audit their PBMs as well as require full transparency as to manufacturer rebates and administrative fees paid for drugs or services provided in connection with the sponsor’s plan, including the portion of such rebates retained by the PBM. 
Additionally, CMS requires MAOs and PDPs to ensure through their contractual arrangements with first tier, downstream and related entities that CMS has access to such entities’ books and records pertaining to services performed in connection with CMS contracts. CMS regulations also require that MAOs and PDPs contractually require their first tier, downstream and related entities (subcontractors) to comply with certain elements of the MAO’s and PDP’s compliance program. The Company has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that such disclosure and auditing requirements, to the extent required by its MAO and PDP partners, will have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s business.
The Company expects CMS and the U.S. Congress to continue to closely scrutinize each component of the Medicare program, modify the terms and requirements of the program and possibly seek to modify private insurers’ role. Therefore, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any Congressional or regulatory activity, either of which could 

13




have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Other Federal and State Laws and Regulations
Federal Laws and Regulations affecting Procurement. In addition to the laws and regulations cited in the section entitled Fraud, Waste and Abuse laws above, the Company is subject to other federal laws and regulations in connection with its contracts with the federal government. These laws and regulations affect how the Company conducts business with its federal agency customers and may impose added costs on its business. The Company’s failure to comply with federal procurement laws and regulations could cause it to lose business, incur additional costs and subject it to a variety of civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, harm to reputation, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies. The Company conducts business with federal agency customers and federal contractors to such agencies. 
The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Armed Forces Services Corporation (“AFSC”), conducts business with federal agency customers and federal contractors to such agencies. The Company investigated, with the assistance of outside counsel, matters relating to compliance by AFSC with Small Business Administration ( “SBA”) regulations and other federal laws applicable to government contractors and reported findings to the SBA and the Department of Defense, including facts indicating violations of SBA regulations and other federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Act, by former AFSC executives, none of which was disclosed to Magellan prior to its acquisition of AFSC. The Company voluntarily responded to government requests for further information regarding the Company’s investigation. As a result of the Company's disclosure and the ensuing government investigation, a former AFSC executive pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to one count of honest services fraud, and at sentencing in September 2020, the Court ordered the former AFSC executive to pay restitution to AFSC as the victim of that offense. In June 2020, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia (“U.S. Attorney’s Office”) informed the Company of a civil investigation regarding the Company and AFSC related to potential violations of the False Claims Act and/or the Anti-Kickback Act also stemming from the matters self-disclosed by the Company. While the Company believes that it has responded appropriately by self-reporting findings regarding matters that incepted prior to its acquisition of AFSC in order to mitigate the risk of adverse consequences, should the Company or AFSC be held responsible for the reported conduct in a proceeding initiated by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, SBA, Department of Defense and/or other federal agencies, we may be required to pay damages and/or penalties and AFSC could be suspended or debarred from government contracting. Management believes that the resolution of such investigations will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance in this regard. AFSC generated approximately 3.0% and 2.4% of the Company’s total revenue from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
The Company also provides services to various state Medicaid programs. Services procurement related to Medicaid programs is governed in part by federal regulations because the federal government provides a substantial amount of funding for the services. The Company’s state customers risk loss of federal funding if the Company is not in compliance with federal regulations. The Company’s non-compliance may also lead to unanticipated, negative financial consequences including corrective action plans or contract default risks. 
FDA Regulation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) generally has authority to regulate drug promotional activities that are performed “by or on behalf of” a drug manufacturer. The Company provides certain consulting and related services to drug manufacturers, and there can be no assurance that the FDA will not attempt to assert jurisdiction over certain aspects of the Company’s activities. The impact of future FDA regulation could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
State PBM Regulation. States continue to introduce broad legislation to regulate PBM activities. This legislation encompasses some of the services offered by the Company’s PBM business. Legislation in this area is varied and encompasses licensing, audit provisions, network access, recoupment of funds, submission of claims data to state all payor claims databases, potential fiduciary duties, pass through of cost savings and disclosure obligations, including the disclosure of information regarding the company’s maximum allowable cost pricing with pharmacies. In some circumstances, claims or inquiries against PBMs have been asserted under state consumer protection laws, which exist in most states. The Company has obtained licenses as necessary to support current business and future opportunities. The Company generally believes that state regulation relating to employer sponsored benefit plans is pre-empted by ERISA. However, in a December 2020 decision, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Rutledge v. Pharmaceutical Care 

14




Management Association that ERISA does not pre-empt state rate or cost regulations that do not force plans to adopt particular benefit coverages. The various state laws enacted to date do not appear to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s pharmaceutical management business. However, the Company can give no assurance that these and other states will not enact legislation with more adverse consequences in the near future; nor can the Company be certain that future regulations or interpretations of existing laws, including ERISA, will not adversely affect its business.
State Legislation Affecting Plan or Benefit Design. Some states have enacted legislation that prohibits certain types of managed care plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive formulary and network design features, and many states have legislation regulating various aspects of managed care plans, including provisions relating to pharmacy benefits. Other states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions and require health plan coverage of specific drugs, if deemed medically necessary by the prescribing physician. Such legislation does not generally apply to the Company directly, but may apply to certain clients of the Company, such as HMOs and health insurers. These types of laws would generally have an adverse effect on the ability of a PBM to reduce cost for its plan sponsor customers.
Prompt Pay Laws. Under Medicare Part D and some state laws, the Company or customer may be required to pay network pharmacies within certain time periods and/or by electronic transfer instead of by check. The shorter time periods may negatively impact our cash flow. We cannot predict whether additional states will enact some form of prompt pay legislation.
Legislation and Regulation Affecting Drug Price and Rebates. Specialty pharmaceutical manufacturers generally report various price metrics to the federal government, including “average sales price” (“ASP”), “average manufacturer price” (“AMP”) and “best price” (“BP”). The Company does not calculate these price metrics, but the Company notes that the ASP, AMP and BP methodologies may create incentives for some drug manufacturers to reduce the levels of discounts or rebates available to purchasers, including the Company, or their clients with respect to specialty drugs. Any changes in the guidance affecting pharmaceutical manufacturer price metric calculations could materially adversely affect the Company’s business.
Additionally, most of the Company’s pharmacy benefit management and dispensing contracts with its customers use “average wholesale price” (“AWP”) as a benchmark for establishing pricing. There can be no guarantee that AWP will continue to be an available pricing metric in the future. The discontinuance of AWP reporting by one data source has not had a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and the Company expects that were AWP data to no longer be available, other equitable pricing measures would be available to avoid a material adverse impact on the Company’s business. Separately, on a monthly basis CMS publishes the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (“NADAC”), a data set that purports to provide the average acquisition cost of retail drugs based on a nationwide voluntary survey of retail pharmacies. At this time, the Company does not anticipate that NADAC will materially adversely impact its operations, but it is too early to speculate what impact, if any, such a reimbursement shift might have in pharmacy reimbursement and/or costs in the future.
In November 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (“HHS-OIG”) published a final rule which would remove the anti-kickback regulatory safe harbor protection for prescription drug rebates paid by manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D. It also would create a new safe harbor protection for price discounts between manufacturers and PBMs if given at the point-of-sale (“POS”). This rule does not apply to commercial rebates. The legality of the rule has been challenged in federal district court. In connection with that proceeding and with HHS’ consent, on January 30, 2021, the federal district court ordered that implementation of the rule be postponed until January 1, 2023, and the litigation challenging the rule be briefly held in abeyance while HHS reviews the rule but will continue at a later date. While we do not believe the proposed rule would have a material adverse impact on our business, we anticipate that President Biden and Congress may seek to adopt laws to control drug prices and other related measures, which could materially and adversely affect our commercial pharmacy benefits management rebate business. 
​
Regulations Affecting the Company’s Pharmacies. The Company owns three pharmacies that provide services primarily to members of certain of the Company’s health plan customers. The activities undertaken by the Company’s pharmacies subject the pharmacies to state and federal statutes and regulations governing, among other things, the licensure and operation of mail order and nonresident pharmacies, repackaging of drug products, stocking of prescription drug products and dispensing of prescription drug products, including controlled substances. The Company’s pharmacy facilities are located in Florida and Utah, and are duly licensed to conduct business in those states. However, almost all states require out-of-state mail order pharmacies to register with or be licensed by the state board of pharmacy or similar 

15




governing body when pharmaceuticals are delivered by mail into the state, and some states require that an out-of-state pharmacy employ a pharmacist that is licensed in the state into which pharmaceuticals are shipped. The Company holds mail order and nonresident pharmacy licenses where required. The Company also maintains Medicare and Medicaid provider licenses where required in order for the pharmacies to provide services to these plans. In some states, the Company is not able to obtain Medicaid licenses to dispense because those states require that the pharmacy have a physical location in the state to participate in the Medicaid network.
Regulation of Controlled Substances. The Company’s pharmacies must register with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) and individual state-controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances. Federal law requires the Company to comply with the DEA’s security, recordkeeping, inventory control and labeling standards in order to dispense controlled substances. State controlled substance law requires registration and compliance with state pharmacy licensure, registration or permit standards promulgated by the state pharmacy licensing authority and in some states drug database reporting requirements.
