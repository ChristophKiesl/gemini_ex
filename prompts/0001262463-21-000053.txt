Item 1. Business
Business Overview
 Healthtech Solutions, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Utah on October 18, 1985. The Company had no business operations from April 25, 2015, when it spun off its only operational subsidiary, until November 16, 2020 when the Company acquired all of the capital stock of Medi-Scan Inc. in exchange for Series A Preferred Stock representing 97% of the equity in Healthtech Solutions (the "Share Exchange"). Medi-Scan is now the locus of all of the business carried on by Healthtech Solutions.
 As a result of the Share Exchange, the Medi-Scan shareholders become the majority shareholders and have control of Healthtech Solutions. The acquisition of Medi-Scan was accounted for as a reverse merger effected by a share exchange. Healthtech Solutions is considered the legal acquirer and Medi-Scan is considered the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the historical financial statements presented in this report are those of Medi-Scan.
 Medi-Scan Inc. (formerly Medi-Scan LLC) was organized in December 2018 to pursue innovation in medical technology, specifically, in the first instance, software for medical purposes. The founders of Medi-Scan recognized that the expanding use of portable ultrasound devices created a market demand for analytic software that would produce enhanced ultrasound images. Since December 2018, therefore, Medi-Scan researchers have been engaged in developing the software and protocols necessary to create advanced three-dimensional ultrasound images.
 Today we have a cloud-based software application capable of converting a two-dimensional analog grayscale ultrasound image into a digital three-dimensional high definition color format that vastly expands the visual data available to the physician, and delivers the data to the physician while the patient is present. We have also made substantial advances in developing technology relating to the detection and treatment of cardiomyopathy. As a result of this developmental activity, Medi-Scan has filed three provisional patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office:

· | System Method, Apparatus, and Computer Program Product for Ultrasonic Clinical Decision Support;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | System, Method, and Apparatus for Monitoring Cardiac Tissue Damage; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | System, Method, and Apparatus for Stimulating Cardiac Muscle Injury Recovery.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Through its ongoing research efforts, Medi-Scan expects to develop additional technology and application methods of strategic value to the Company, for which it may seek patent protection.
 The reverse merger of Medi-Scan into Healthtech Solutions in November 2020 enhanced our potential access to capital by affording us a listing on a public market. If we are able to leverage that platform to secure adequate capital, we intend to implement a three-prong business plan aimed at:
 
1. | The creation and commercialization of cloud-based software for ultrasound scans, which delivers to a medical professional, at the point of patient care, data-driven quantifiable images;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The development of cutting-edge medical therapies for the treatment of disease or injury, such as damage resulting from COVID-19 infection; and
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | The acquisition or investment in integrative medical diagnostic or therapeutic software or devices.

Healthcare Industry Imaging Sector
 In the healthcare industry, ultrasound technology is an irreplaceable tool for patient pathology assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. It has definite advantages over alternative imaging modalities (CT, PET or MRI scans and X-rays): ease of use, convenience, simplicity, safety, patient comfort, cost, and diagnostic or follow-up monitoring. However, until now, the quality of images produced by ultrasound substantially lagged those produced by the alternatives. Medi-Scan's software bridges that gap.
 Ultrasound technology is safe for all patients, including those with pacemakers and metal implants (with the exception of certain fetal examinations). In contrast to CT, PET, and X-rays, ultrasound does not produce high frequency/high energy emissions, allowing for ongoing monitoring of a patient. Procedurally, CT, PET, and MRI require a patient to obtain prior payment approval, make appointments with a separate facility, and have images read by a radiologist who renders a report back to the originating physician. Medi-Scan's software, by contrast, is safely and securely available from “the cloud” anywhere there is an internet connection, and provides advanced three-dimensional interior and exterior digital images with the analytic utility of CT, PET or MRI scans.
 Imaging: Market Potential 
 There are just under 600 million medical imaging procedures performed annually in the U.S. Advancements in imaging technology are likely to drive the number of procedures that are performed, in response to increasing demand for early stage diagnosis of chronic disease. In addition, as the population ages, more imaging procedures will be required as elderly patients are diagnosed with conditions that require imaging.

Within the past few years, the desire for point-of-care imaging has determined the direction of the imaging market. Chip-based handheld ultrasound devices are becoming well-accepted for point-of-care and primary care uses. Medical professionals have quickly realized the wide-spread versatility of a handheld ultrasound device with an affordable cost. POCUS and handheld systems now represent a rapidly growing portion of sales of ultrasound technology in the United States and worldwide.
 The explosion of the Covid-19 pandemic during 2020 has further demonstrated the need for advanced diagnostic and monitoring imaging at the point of care. Imaging plays a major role in COVID-19 treatment because of the complications caused by COVID-19 to a patient's cardiovascular, pulmonary and other systems. However, CT or X-ray systems are not readily accessible for COVID-19 patients, as contagious or potentially contagious patients require isolation. Moreover, equipment and technicians that come into proximity with a COVID-19 patient must be sanitized after each exposure event, which for large stationary equipment is time consuming and costly.
 Portable ultrasound devices that require only one technician and simple device sanitation are ideal for use in a COVID-19 situation as well as isolation hospital wards, clinics, physician offices, or remote settings such as some nursing homes. Ultrasound devices with the Medi-Scan software application will enable healthcare professionals to obtain 3D HD image data needed for COVID-19 patient evaluation, diagnosis, and monitoring anyplace there is an internet connection.
 Our cloud-based application is peculiarly useful within the COVID-19 context, as it transforms a cloudy ultrasound image into a 3D high-definition ultrasound images that enable the physician to discern the presence of COVID-19 lung lesions. Using a portable ultrasound device coupled to our APP will reduce the pressure on hospitals to transport patients to land-locked CT/MRI devices for scans, with the resulting risk of transient infection. By bridging the gap in imaging, the Medi-Scan APP system can helps triage COVID-19 patients at the ER.
 Our template-guided system also facilitates ongoing monitoring of the COVID-19 patient by capturing the current region of interest, computing the relative brightness and fiber count (density) of the lesion, and comparing the results against prior scans, thus alerting medical personnel to changes within a chart.
 Imaging: Software as a Service ("SaaS")
 We intend to market our imaging technology through the Software as a Service ("‘SaaS") model. SaaS is a business model where the application is held in the cloud and accessed by a local computer, tablet or smartphone via the internet. The immediate benefit of the SaaS model is that SaaS reduces the need to own and host both hardware and software, hire the technical personal needed for maintenance, and maintain up-to-the-minute cybersecurity. The healthcare industry is rapidly adopting the SaaS model for clinical information systems — for example, PACS, HER, and telehealth — and nonclinical information systems such as billing, RCM, and supply chain management.

The healthcare industry has seen in the SaaS model an effective means of quickly deploying new software for medical specialties while avoiding the purchasing and installation complexities inherent in in-house IT. Most individual physicians, clinics, and hospitals now use SaaS applications for their patient portals, telemedicine, scheduling, record keeping, prescribing, data migration, and mobile communications. Benefits include increased physician and patient satisfaction, workflow improvements and lower operational costs, along with decreased downtime.
 Imaging: Competition
 The direct competition for our system is likely to be, in the first instance, the software now sold with mobile ultrasound machines. Most manufacturers of handheld ultrasound machines sell their machines coupled with a subscription to the manufacturer's installed software. To compete for software sales with the producers of handheld devices, we will have to demonstrate to their customers the superiority of the images produced using the Medi-Scan APP.
  As other imaging software enters the market, we expect our SaaS system to compete effectively within the medical community by offering high-quality images, accuracy, speed, compatibility and reduced cost. Our ability to achieve low friction onboarding of an expanding customer base with its recurring revenues should enable Medi-Scan to market its SaaS APP at attractive price points. But our most important competitive advantage will be the quality of the images produced by the Medi-Scan APP. 
 Intellectual Property: Imaging Technology
 Medi-Scan has developed a novel medical imaging technology APP that provides observational metrics (something that can be quantified) for assessment of targeted tissues rather than conventional inference or interpretative assessment of an image scan (i.e. an educated guess). The Medi-Scan system utilizes an initial ultrasound two-dimensional analog scan and transforms that scan into a three-dimensional (3D) high definition format which provides a detailed data-driven digital image. Our system transforms classic B-mode ultrasound images into 3D digital images, while identifying tissue boundaries, thereby permitting an objective evaluation of tissue integrity. Hypoechoic structures, which are typically found in tissue linings are readily identified by our imaging technology, and yield the 3D images for visualization of the underlying tissue structure. Once we obtain visualization of the underlying tissue structure, we can apply observational metrics to give numerical evaluations of the target tissue instead of subjective interpretations.
 Using our APP, a medical professional can takes an ultrasound scan, transmit it via the internet to the cloud-based Medi-Scan server, where it is processed and transmitted back within minutes, enabling the medical professional to view the enhanced image on a cellphone, tablet or computer. Medi-Scan's report provides the doctor a clear image of what was a blur on the conventional ultrasound report and visualizes boundary layers in the target tissue. That visualization enables structural evaluation of the target tissue and, in particular, identifies injuries expressed as broken tissue component.
 The Medi-Scan system permits the user to publish reports with quantifiable metrics that express tissue health, tissue dimensions, and comparative analysis. Among the faculties are:

-


● | Identification and computation of organ dimensions. Deep internal organ structures must be imaged with lower frequency ultrasounds. Nevertheless, our system permits evaluation of the same tissue boundary conditions and, in particular, evaluates the incident reflection (surface) as well as the backscatter reflection (interior) to identify tissue structures. Once these structures are identified, we are able to construct a 3D articulated model, which also enables internal and external measurements. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Tissue Taggingtm. Frequently, tissue structures have overlapping regions that inhibit a visual evaluation through conventional imaging. As our technology first converts the underlying tissue structure to a 3D digital form, we are developing a capacity to excise that overlying structure from the 3D image by applying a "Tissue Tag". Once the "Tissue Tag" has been applied and the overlying structure is excised, our system may reveal a visualization of the underlying targeted tissue. In addition, because tendon is a separate structure in the image, we can compute the diameter of each tendon and the internal volume of related areas. This volume can then be translated directly into pressure metrics and displayed to the patient to demonstrate that the therapy is working.
● | Comparison of patient visit reports over time. Our system tracks fiber bundle counts which are reduced with injury but increased with rehabilitation. By month-to-month comparison, we are able to track patient improvement digitally. 
● | Detect and prevent future injuries. Dense tissues consisting of rope-like structures go through several discrete stages as they are stressed. A tendon, for example, is normally stretched and then returns to its original length and condition. When the tendon is stressed beyond a certain point, however, it enters a "plastic region" in which the tendon does not return to its former shape. If stressed beyond the plastic region, the tendon will break. Unfortunately, in all dense tissues, the range from linear stress to plastic region is very difficult to observe on B-mode ultrasound. However, through a technique known as acoustoelasticity coupled with our technology, we can identify plastic regions and alert the physician to the risk that has developed. 

 When engaged with a cell phone (Apple or Android) and a portable ultrasound device, the Medi-Scan technology has the potential to offer high definition medical imaging in situ, potentially altering the efficiency and effectiveness of sports medicine and ER services everywhere. The Medi-Scan APP increases the medical professional's ability to use Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) for meaningful data-driven clinical evaluations and supports the choice and monitoring of treatment. The Medi-Scan APP will integrate with existing medical record systems, facilitate monitoring of a patient's progress, and document compliance with required protocols and procedures for billing and other purposes.
 Intellectual Property: Cardiomyopathy Imaging
 The SARS-CoV-2 virus can damage the heart in several ways. The virus may directly invade or inflame the heart muscle, and consequently the heart, by disrupting the balance between oxygen supply and demand. COVID (the illness) can affect the heart indirectly by producing inflammatory cells that circulate in the patient's blood and damage heart muscle. Research has found that these effects are not age-specific. COVID-19 may directly or indirectly affect heart muscle cells and other heart tissue even among patients who did not have signs or symptoms of COVID-19. 

5

Healthy heart muscle contains long fibers called sarcomeres which are the active structures responsible for muscular contraction. The SARS-CoV-2 virus infection has been observed in some COVID-19 patients to cause these fibers to break apart into small pieces, a phenomenon called "sarcomeric shredding". Sarcomeric shredding can restrict the heart muscle's ability to beat, and may explain the lasting cardiac defects in many COVID-19 patients. As cardiomyopathy (heart damage) and related effects can occur several years after exposure to COVID-19, the consequences may include accelerated coronary artery disease, stiffening of the heart muscle, inflammation and thickening of the pericardial sac, problems with electrical conduction, or damage to heart valves.
 A recent study in a cell culture by the Gladstone Institute showed that infecting heart cells with SARS-CoV-2 caused the building blocks of muscles to orient in multiple directions, rather than be arranged in an organized line as they are in healthy muscle. These findings could explain some of the medical issues being observed in certain COVID patients’ hearts long after they otherwise recover from COVID-19.
 Researchers performing an assessment of sarcomere shredding are currently unable to use ultrasound for scanning purposes. Conventional ultrasound devices are not configured to visualize sarcomeres or sarcomeric shredding. Furthermore, myocardial movement (heartbeat) complicates direct analysis of the myocardium. For this reason, researchers studying sarcomere shredding currently use CT and MRI scans coupled with biopsy confirmations. Each of these present significant risks. Radiation therapy can induce heart disease if any part of the heart is exposed to the radiation. A single CT scan may produce radiation exposure equivalent to 200-1,500 X-rays. In addition, biopsies are invasive procedures that carry inherent risks. So a method of utilizing ultrasound in connection with assessment of sarcomeric shredding could be life-saving.
 Medi-Scan has identified potential methods of visualizing sarcomeric shredding and assessing cardiomyopathies with ultrasound techniques. Instead of a direct measurement, Medi-Scan uses parametric measurements to detect cardiac tissue damage. This simple and fast technique may serve as the means to detect or monitor patients with known or suspected cardiomyopathy (heart damage) on a regular basis over time. With an early means of detection of cardiomyopathies, preventative measures could be employed to mitigate the adverse effects of cardiomyopathies.
 Intellectual Property: Cardiomyopathy Treatment
 With the capabilities provided by the Medi-Scan APP for pulmonary tissue imaging, we believe that we can expand its capabilities to detect and quantify cardiac injuries. Once the injury is identified, treatment of a COVID-19 injured heart can be measured and monitored. The Medi-Scan research team is exploring a method of potentially leveraging this capability through development of the ability to identify and track myocardial deformities to enable implementation of a therapy to ameliorate and potentially repair myocardial damage.

6
-

To advance this approach, Medi-Scan researchers are developing a combination therapy as a method of treatment for the detected myocardial injury. This includes a combination of stem cell therapy and electromagnetic field therapy, known as "Entrainment", which is currently used to address tachycardia (rapid heartbeat). Entrainment works by linking the patient’s abnormal heart rhythm together with a normal heart rhythm. and gently encouraging the damaged heart rhythm to revert to a more normal rhythm. The Medi-Scan researchers believe that this therapy may be able to promote the reconstruction of isotropic (irregular orientation) cardiac fibers into anisotropic (regular orientation) fibers. In effect, the treatment may be able to repair the damaged heart muscle by encouraging the restoration of a cardiac waveform consistent with a healthy heart.
 As part of these efforts, Medi-Scan is also developing software technology for cardio imaging that compares a healthy heart rhythm electronic signal with a damaged heart’s signal, and derives an electronic signal representing the potentially curative waveform. Then, through a monitored feed-back mechanism, the curative electronic signal would be introduced into the patient by the feedback loop to achieve a reversion to the healthy heart rhythm.
 The reversion of the patient cardiac waveform from injured to healthy may also be aided by the use of the stem cell technology discussed above, which, if successful, will assist in repairing the sarcomere damage. As this process will be implemented gently over time, it is vital to have the ability to track cardiac waveforms and internal cardiac measurements such as internal strain components. This strain tracking is performed automatically using a technology assist called Automated Functional Imaging. As they test the theoretical aspects of the system, Medi-Scan researchers are attempting to incorporate off-the-shelf components, including a wearable ECG, for patient convenience and lower cost.
 As noted above, clinical and potentially pre-clinical research data will be required to support submissions to the FDA for marketing clearance to permit marketing of the cardiac interventional technology in the U.S. Without additional clinical data, the likelihood of FDA approval of this technology is difficult to determine. It may be necessary or advisable for Medi-Scan to collaborate with another company, such as an entity with expertise in stem cell therapy, to conduct the clinical trials and to meet FDA requirements for marketing approval. It is possible that the FDA will require that the entity providing the therapeutic component be the lead entity in the marketing submission for this element of our portfolio.
 Regulatory Requirements
 FDA Medical Device Regulation
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") has broad authority over the regulation of medical devices marketed for sale in the United States, as well as medical devices manufactured in the United States and exported to international markets. Medical devices must be shown to be safe and effective for their intended use, and data demonstrating safety and effectiveness that is provided to the FDA must be adequate to enable the agency to make regulatory decisions related to marketing approval.
 Under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), the FDA classifies each medical device into one of three classes: Class I, Class II or Class III. Class I medical devices are deemed to pose the lowest risk to the patient. We anticipate that our imaging APP will be reviewed as a Class I device since it consists of software and there are no patient-facing components (i.e. nothing touches the patient and there is no energy transfer to the patient). In addition, our imaging APP is not completely novel, and there are legally marketed devices that can be used as predicate devices. The safety and efficacy of our imaging APP can be assured through the use of general and special controls, and the technology used is sufficiently similar that risks and benefits of the technology can be evaluated using prior knowledge.


7
-

We anticipate that the FDA will require primarily software-based testing, which will compare the accuracy and consistency of clinical interpretations using the product versus interpretations using an alternative imaging modality, with limited requirements for clinical testing. It will be necessary to provide data related to software validation and verification. From the perspective of FDA, software validation and verification are required under the Quality System Regulations. Validation determines if the product works as intended for the end user; verification confirms that the software, as coded, functions properly. Software validation establishes, using objective evidence, that the device specifications conform with user needs and intended uses, and is demonstrated by identifying user needs and testing against those needs to ensure that the product requirements and software specifications result in a software product that meets those needs. Validation testing is typically conducted through use cases or clinical testing.
 Verification testing confirms that the output of the software matches inputs, and confirms using objective evidence that the specified requirements have been fulfilled. Accurate and detailed product requirements and design specifications are necessary to permit efficient verification testing. Testing should confirm that the product both performs as intended, and in the way anticipated. Verification testing will also include verification of adequate design for purposes of assuring the cybersecurity of the device.
 Class I medical devices are subject to the lowest degree of regulatory scrutiny and need only comply with the FDA’s General Controls. The General Controls include compliance with the registration, listing, adverse event reporting requirements, and applicable portions of the Quality Systems Regulations, or QSR, as well as the general misbranding and adulteration prohibitions. Unless specifically exempted in the regulations, General Controls require most companies that intend to market a Class I medical device, such as our imaging APP, to gain clearance for marketing through the 510(k) process.
 To obtain 510(k) clearance for our imaging APP, we will be required to submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed medical device is substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a previously cleared medical device used for the same indications. Typically, data must be submitted to the FDA demonstrating similar technology and clinical and non- clinical performance, electromagnetic compatibility, software validation, and when appropriate, biocompatibility characteristics. FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months. On average the review time is approximately six months, but it can take significantly longer than twelve months in some instances, as the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
 We anticipate that a separate 510(k) clearance will be required for each usage class for which we market our imaging APP - i.e. an application for lung scans, an application for heart scans, an application for tendon scans, etc. However, each application will build on what was demonstrated in prior applications, and so the time and expense required will reduce as we gain a body of approvals.


8
-

After a medical device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a new 510(k) notice, or a premarket approval, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the FDA may levy significant regulatory fines or penalties on the manufacturer.
 Any of the devices that we are developing for use in treatment of cardiomyopathy will be classified as Class III devices, which are those devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared medical device. Class III medical devices require a Pre-Market Approval ("PMA") before commercialization. This is the most stringent regulatory review, and requires substantial development of clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness before the FDA permits the device to be marketed. The Filing Fee payable to the FDA for a PMA is $365,657; the Small Business Fee is $91,414 (as compared to $12,432 and $3,108 for submission of a 510(k) application). In addition, to the extent that we are seeking approval for a medical diagnostic or therapeutic product that would be classified as biologic or pharmaceutical product, FDA guidelines will require that we partner with an FDA-approved biological or pharmaceutical company to perform the requisite studies. Such a partnering arrangement may require that we license our technology to the partner for regulatory and marketing purposes.
 It is important to note that, because the FDA’s determination is based on its evaluation of the data and regulatory decision-making regarding safety, effectiveness and compliance with other legal and regulatory requirements, approval of a marketing application is not assured.
 Healthcare Regulation in General
 Our future business operations and activities in the U.S. may be directly or indirectly subject to subject to certain federal and state laws relating to the privacy and security of health information, and state and federal laws designed to guard against healthcare fraud and abuse, including, but not limited to, those described below.

9
-


● | HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, established comprehensive requirements related to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. It governs patient privacy practices of healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses (or “covered entities”), as well as their respective business associates to the extent that they perform services for or on behalf of the covered entities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information. HIPAA also mandates notification in the event of a breach and regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions. Covered entities and business associates may be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, as well as enforcement by state attorneys general, for violations of HIPAA or its implementing regulations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | HIPAA also imposes federal criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. 
● | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
● | The federal Civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” or “whistleblower” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government, alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. 
● | The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies. 
● | Analogous state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid, other state programs, or, in some states, private third-party payors. In addition, many U.S. states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering adopting further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements. These state laws, which may be even more stringent than the HIPAA requirements, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and are often not preempted by the federal requirements.

These and other regulations of the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies in and outside the U.S. impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business. We will also be subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory bodies, both in and outside the U.S. (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and various state Attorneys General), will monitor the promotion and advertising of our products. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products, limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations.
 We plan to gain access for our products to the E.U. market. In the E.U., a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. The competent authorities of the E.U. countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. A new Medical Device Regulation was published by the E.U. in 2017 which imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements (EU MDR). Implementation of the new requirements is scheduled to commence in May 2021.
 The global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and ultimately, our ability to obtain approvals for our products.
 Marketing Plan
 The Company's current focus is on developing innovative medical software and related applications or therapies. Our products will require FDA approval before commercialization. The Company is currently assessing the market environment in which it will compete in selling its software products, services, or therapies. The medical industry is undergoing significant and fast-paced changes, to which we will have to adapt. Traditional marketing and sales methods are being changed and, in some cases, being dramatically transformed by both technological advances and governmental factors such as new regulations and new procedures for cost reimbursements.
 To effectively present the Company to the medical market and provide a consistent brand message, we have engaged Investor Brand Network (IBN) as our marketing agent. IBN will issue press releases on the Company's progress and distribute content information for syndication in appropriate media to educate the medical industry. IBN, through its network, provides:
 
1. | access to a network of wire services to reach target markets, industries and demographics;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | article and editorial syndication to 5,000+ news outlets; 
3. | enhanced press release solutions; 
4. | media distribution to a large social media audience; and 
5. | an array of corporate communications focused on the IBN Podcast Series.

The Company's success in marketing its developments in software or therapeutic devices and methodologies will be dependent on the Company's application of the most effective commercialization opportunities for efficiently generating sales. Possible alternatives include licensing a specific device or therapy to a national or specialty healthcare and marketing organization, a joint venture with strategic partners, establishing an independent marketing and sales team focused on direct sales through strategic healthcare delivery outlets, and using healthcare-focused social media. Management intends to carefully review the alternatives in order to make an informed choice among the array of potential approaches to marketing.
 Employees
 Healthtech Solutions currently has no employees. There are currently two individuals who devote substantially all of their business time to Medi-Scan: the President of Healthtech Solutions and the Chief Research Officer for its subsidiary, Medi-Scan. They are assisted by fourteen hourly consultants, all of whom work for Medi-Scan on a part time basis.
