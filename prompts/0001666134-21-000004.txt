Item 1.    Business
Overview
We have created comprehensive cloud-based solutions designed to transform and modernize accounting and finance operations for organizations of all types and sizes. Our secure, scalable solutions support critical accounting processes such as the financial close, account reconciliations, cash application, intercompany accounting, and compliance. By introducing software to automate these processes and to enable them to function continuously, we empower our customers to improve the integrity of their financial reporting, increase efficiency in their accounting and finance processes and enhance real-time visibility into their results and operations.
Critical accounting and finance processes underlie the integrity of an organization’s financial reports. The lack of effective accounting and finance tools can result in inefficient and cumbersome processes and, in some cases, accounting errors, restatements and write-offs, as well as material weaknesses and significant deficiencies. Traditional enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems do not generally provide effective solutions for processes handled outside of an organization’s general ledger, such as balance sheet account reconciliation, intercompany transaction accounting and the broader financial close process. Many organizations also use multiple ERPs and other financial systems without a platform to efficiently integrate them. As a result, to manage these tasks, organizations rely on spreadsheets and other error-prone and labor-intensive processes that are unsuited for the increasing regulatory complexity and transaction volumes encountered by many modern businesses. We believe that we are creating a new category of powerful cloud-based software that is capable of automating and streamlining accounting and finance operations, in a manner that complements and supports traditional ERP 
systems. We believe our customers benefit from cost savings through improvements in process management and staff productivity, in addition to managing a faster financial close.
Our mission is to transform how accounting and finance departments operate. Our approach modernizes what historically has been done through batch processing and manual controls typically applied only during the month, quarter or year-end financial close, and delivers dynamic workflows embedded within a real-time, highly automated framework, a process we refer to as “continuous accounting.” It also enables up-to-date analytics, provides industry-benchmarked metrics and is designed to help customers run more efficiently while achieving greater accuracy, control and transparency. We believe the need for our software has been driven by growing business and information technology complexities, transaction volumes and expanding regulatory requirements. Our software integrates with, and obtains data from, more than 30 different ERP systems, including NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, and Workday, as well as many other financial systems and applications such as bank accounts, sub-ledgers and in-house databases. 
We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, BlackLine Systems, Inc. (“BlackLine Systems”). BlackLine Systems funded its business with investments from our founder and cash flows from operations until September 3, 2013.  On September 3, 2013, we acquired BlackLine Systems, and Silver Lake Sumeru and Iconiq acquired a controlling interest in us, which we refer to as the “2013 Acquisition.” The 2013 Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and resulted in a change in accounting basis as of the date of the 2013 Acquisition.
On October 2, 2020, we acquired Rimilia Holdings Ltd. (“Rimilia”), which is referred to as the “Rimilia Acquisition". The primary purpose of the Rimilia Acquisition was to extend the Company’s capabilities into an adjacent area, adding accounts receivable automation to financial close automation.
Our cloud-based products include Account Reconciliations, Cash Application, Compliance, Consolidation Integrity Manager, Intercompany Hub, Journal Entry, Task Management, Transaction Matching, and Variance Analysis. These products are offered to customers as scalable solutions that support critical accounting processes, such as the financial close, account reconciliations, cash application, intercompany accounting, and compliance. 
Our Growth Strategy
Our principal growth strategies include the following:
Continue to Innovate and Expand our Platform. Our ability to internally develop or make strategic acquisitions of new, market-leading applications and functionalities is integral to our success, and we intend to continue extending the functionality and range of our applications to bring new solutions to accounting and finance.
Enhance Our Leadership Position with Enterprise Market and Mid-Market Companies. We believe we have a leading position in the enhanced financial controls and automation market with both enterprise market and mid-market companies. We intend to leverage our brand, history of innovation, and customer focus to maintain and grow our leadership position with enterprise market businesses. In addition, we believe that mid-market businesses are particularly underserved and that our platform can help these businesses modernize their accounting and finance processes efficiently and effectively. 
Increase Existing Customer Spend through Expanded Usage and Adoption of Additional Products. We pursue a land-and-expand sales model and believe there is significant opportunity to increase sales of our solutions within our existing customer base. Our pricing model is designed to allow us to capture additional revenue as our customers’ usage of our platform grows, providing us with an opportunity to increase the lifetime value of our customer relationships.
Expand Our International Operations and Customer Footprint. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand the use of our cloud-based products outside the United States. We have an established presence in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, and we intend to invest in further expanding our footprint in these and other regions through organic growth activities and strategic acquisitions.
Extend Our Customer Relationships and Distribution Channels. We have established strong relationships with technology vendors such as SAP and NetSuite, professional services firms such as Deloitte and KPMG, and business process outsourcers such as Cognizant, Genpact, and IBM. We intend to continue to strengthen and 
expand our existing relationships, seek new relationships, and further expand our distribution channels to help us expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
BlackLine Solutions
We provide a powerful cloud-based solution designed to automate and streamline accounting and finance operations. The key elements of our solutions include:
Comprehensive Platform
We offer integrated suites of applications that deliver a broad range of capabilities to support critical accounting processes such as the financial close, account reconciliations, cash application, intercompany accounting, and compliance.
The technology underpinning our software includes a comprehensive base of accounting-specific business logic and rules engines, which enable our customers to implement continuous accounting.
Enterprise Integration
We provide simple, secure and automated tools and integrations to transfer data to and from a range of enterprise-wide processes and systems, including ERPs, financial systems and in-house databases, and other custom applications and data. Our solutions integrate with over 30 ERP systems, including NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, and Workday. In addition, for companies with multiple systems and complex needs, we can connect with any number of general ledger systems simultaneously, resolving many of the issues associated with consolidating data across systems.
Independence
Our solutions are not dependent on any single operating system and work with most major ERP systems our customers may use. Our cross-system functionality allows us to reach a broader group of customers. We are also able to focus on and innovate for the needs of our customers irrespective of updates or changes in their existing systems. We believe this independence provides us with a competitive advantage in the industry over traditional methods.
Ease of Use
Our solutions are designed by accountants, for accountants, to be intuitive and easy to use. We strive to enable any user to rapidly implement our platform to manage their accounting and finance activities, from the simplest to the most sophisticated tasks. Our user-friendly interface provides clear visualization of accounting and finance data, enables user collaboration and streamlines business processes.
Innovation
Our ability to develop innovative products has been a key driver of our success and organic growth. Through a history and culture of thought leadership, we have created a new category of powerful software that automates and streamlines antiquated, manual accounting processes to better meet our clients’ diverse and rapidly changing needs, and we continue to focus on providing advanced solutions to time and labor intensive accounting practices.
Security
Our solutions and services incorporate industry best practices and meet internationally recognized standards with respect to information security management. We have implemented and maintain our certified Information Security Management System in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001 standard requirements. We meet a breadth of requirements for our security control environment, including information security policies, organization of information security, human resource security, access control, cryptography, physical and environmental security, operations security, communications security, information security incident management, and information security aspects of business continuity management. In our continued commitment to customer trust, transparency, and security in service, we provide customers independently validated testing and evaluation of our control environment through issued reports and certifications.
Key Benefits
Our platform is designed to provide the following benefits to our customers:
Flexibility and scalability
Our unified cloud platform is designed for modern business environments and has broad applicability across large and small organizations in almost any industry. The platform supports complex corporate structures, provides integration across core financial systems, manages multiple currencies and languages, and scales to support high transaction volumes.
Embedded controls and workflow
Our solutions are designed for the complex global regulatory environment. Our solutions embed key controls within standardized, repeatable and well-documented workflows, which are designed to result in substantially reduced risk of non-compliance or negative audit findings, greater tolerance for regulatory complexity and increased confidence in financial reports.
Real-time visibility
We provide users with real-time visibility into the status, progress and quality of their accounting processes. With configurable dashboards, user-defined reporting and the ability to drill down to individual reconciliations, journals and tasks, users can track open items, identify bottlenecks within a process or intervene to prevent mistakes.
Automation and efficiency
Our solutions can ingest data from a variety of sources, including ERP systems and other data repositories, and apply powerful, rules-driven automation to reconciliations, journals and transactions. This streamlines accounting processes, minimizes manual data entry and improves individual productivity to help ensure that accounting processes are completed on time. As a result, this automation allows users to focus on value-added activities instead of process management.
Continuous processing
Our solutions help organizations embed quality control, compliance and financial integrity into their day-to-day processes rather than rely on the traditional process of validating financial information at the end of each period. Activities such as account reconciliation and variance analysis can be performed in real-time, thus reducing the risk of errors and creating a more agile accounting environment.
Customers
Our customers include multinational corporations, large domestic enterprises and mid-market companies across a broad array of industries. These businesses include publicly-listed entities and privately-owned enterprises, as well as non-profit entities. At December 31, 2020, we had over 291,000 individual users across more than 3,400 customers exclusive of on-premise software. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription agreement as of the measurement date. In situations where an organization has multiple subsidiaries or divisions, each entity that is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. However, where an existing customer requests its invoice be divided for the sole purpose of restructuring its internal billing arrangement without any incremental increase in revenue, such customer continues to be treated as a single customer.
Products and Services
Our cloud-based solutions for modern accounting are designed to be the primary system of interaction for accountants every day. Our solutions unify systems and data and work to drive accuracy, collaboration, and accountability through visibility. By unifying and automating activity, we enable accounting departments to execute their work continuously, empowering real-time reporting and business partnership. These products are offered to our customers as scalable solutions for critical accounting processes, including financial close management, cash application, and intercompany accounting.
Financial Close Management
The collection of processes by which organizations reconcile, consolidate, and report their financial information at the end of each period is referred to as the financial close. For organizations of any size, the traditional way of closing the books is held together by manual processes and error-prone spreadsheets, increasing risk and threatening the accuracy of financial reporting. Our Financial Close Management solutions allow customers to standardize and automate key steps across the close process to ensure accuracy, control, and timeliness.
•Account Reconciliations provides a centralized workspace from which users can collaborate to complete account reconciliations. Features include standardized templates, workflows for review and approval, linkage to policies and procedures, and integrated storage of supporting documentation. The product automates otherwise manual activities in the reconciliation process, significantly reducing time and effort and increasing productivity. It also enhances internal controls by facilitating the appropriate segregation of duties, simplifying reconciliation audits and adding transparency and visibility to the reconciliation process.
•Transaction Matching analyzes and reconciles high volumes of individual transactions from different sources of data based upon user-configured logic. Our rules engine automatically identifies exceptions, errors, missing data, and variances within massive data sets. The matching engine processes millions of records per minute, can be used with any type of data and allows customers to reconcile transactions in real-time.
•Task Management enables users to create and manage processes and task lists. The product provides automatic and recurring task scheduling, includes configurable workflow and provides a management console for accounting and finance projects. Though most commonly used with the financial close, users can create task lists and projects for hundreds of different use cases ranging from external audits to environmental impact surveys.
•Journal Entry allows users to manually or automatically generate, review and post manual journal entries. Journals can be automatically allocated across multiple business units and calculated based on complex, client-defined logic. More importantly, the addition of validation and approval checkpoints helps ensure the integrity of information passed to other financial applications. Customers can use the Journal Entry product to pass information to hundreds of different ERPs and subsystems in a configurable, easily consumable format.
•Variance Analysis provides “always-on” monitoring and automatically identifies anomalous fluctuations in balance sheet and income statement account balances. Once an account in flux is identified, users are automatically alerted so they can research and determine the source of the fluctuation.
•Consolidation Integrity Manager manages the automated system-to-system tie-out process that occurs during the consolidation phase of the financial close. Companies with multiple ERPs utilize a consolidation system to produce their consolidated financial results. Because these systems contain and produce information that changes continually and requires constant adjustments, a final tie-out that is typically handled manually in a spreadsheet is necessary prior to publishing results. This product automates the tie-out process, aggregating balances from dozens or hundreds of different systems and allowing users to identify exceptions and create adjustments quickly.
•Compliance is an integrated solution that facilitates compliance-related initiatives, consolidates project management, and provides visibility over control self-assessments and testing.
Accounts Receivable Automation
Cash is vital to every business, and accounts receivable automation is central to improving cash flow. Cash application is the process of matching and applying cash receipts to invoices. Managing accounts receivable well means maximizing working capital and minimizing credit losses. This critical process is often highly manual. Our Cash Application product drives an automated and effective end-to-end process from an invoice to cash in the bank and fully applied in the subledger.
•Cash Application transforms the order-to-cash cycle by significantly reducing the time it takes to apply cash receipts to open invoices, resulting in significant reductions in unapplied cash. Cash Application uses intelligent automation to help customers accurately apply payments to 
customers’ invoices in the ERP. Embedded machine learning then reduces the manual effort involved in the process, which can release working capital for our customers.
Intercompany Accounting
Intercompany transactions occur when entities within a corporate parent organization transact with each other. These transactions are some of the most complex and frequent sources of uncertainty for the accounting function. It is a manual, time-consuming, and resource-intensive process. Our Intercompany Hub solution manages the entire intercompany transaction lifecycle within our platform, and we believe it is the only widely available end-to-end intercompany solution. This solution includes the following features: 
•Intercompany Workflow replaces informal, ad-hoc intercompany requests and approvals with a simple, structured workflow approval process. The application stores permissions by entity and transaction type, ensuring that both the initiator and the approver of the intercompany transaction are authorized to conduct business.
•Intercompany Processing records an organization’s intercompany transactions once they reach an appropriate completion level and posts them to the appropriate systems from a single source. The product automatically incorporates local taxes, exchange rates, invoicing requirements, and customer-specific transfer pricing so that the resulting journal entries will net, which reduces the possibility of intercompany differences and eliminates the need to perform a manual reconciliation.
•Netting and Settlement automatically generates a real-time, aggregated settlement matrix, which shows the balance of transactions across an entire organization. Users can filter the information by transaction type, currency or business relationship, easing the process of netting transactions and helping them make informed, strategic decisions.
Services
Customer service is essential to our success. We offer the following services for our customers:
•Implementation. With a focus on configuration over customization, our implementation approach favors rapid and efficient deployments led by accounting experts, rather than technical resources. A typical project will focus on mapping our application to a customer’s current or ideal process, coaching them on best practices, and helping organizations become self-sufficient, instead of dependent on additional professional services. For clients that elect to work with a business process outsourcer or other company for implementation services, our implementation team provides ongoing support in order to ensure that the implementation or finance transformation projects are completed successfully. We generally provide this service for a fixed fee.
•Support. We provide live customer support 24/7/365 from our offices in California, Sydney and London. All customers have access to support resources by phone, email or through our portal, free of charge.
•Customer Success. Our customer success managers, many of whom are former users, provide customers with best practices and help create a roadmap for expanded usage of our platform. We believe that this service, which is made available to all customers, is central to our retention and upsell efforts.
•Training. We offer a variety of live and web-based training options, but most customers elect to consume their training through our e-learning environment, BlackLine U. Courses cover platform functionality, as well as the underlying concepts that make reconciliation, the financial close and other accounting and finance activities necessary.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our solutions through our direct sales force. Our direct sales force leverages our relationships with technology vendors such as SAP and NetSuite, professional services firms such as Deloitte, Ernst & Young, and KPMG and business process outsourcers such as Cognizant, Genpact and IBM, to influence and drive customer growth. In particular, our solution integrates with SAP’s ERP solutions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, SAP became 
part of the reseller channel that we use in the ordinary course of business. SAP has the ability to resell our solutions, as an SAP solution-extension (“SolEx”), for which we receive a percentage of the revenues.
Our marketing efforts are focused on creating sales leads, establishing and extending our brand proposition, generating product awareness, and cultivating our community of users. We generate sales leads primarily through word-of-mouth, search engine marketing, outbound lead generation, and our network of business process outsourcers, business services organizations and resellers. We leverage online and offline marketing channels on a global basis and organize customer roundtables and user conferences and release white papers, case studies, blogs, and digital programs and seminars. We have further extended our brand awareness through sponsorships with leading industry organizations such as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or AICPA, the Institute of Management Accountants, or IMA, the Financial Executives International, or FEI, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, or ICAEW, and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, or ACCA.
Competition
The market for accounting and financial software and services is competitive, rapidly evolving and requires deep understanding of the industry standards, accounting rules and global financial regulations.
We compete with vendors of financial automation software such as Trintech, and we also compete with components of Oracle’s Hyperion software. Further, other established software vendors not currently focused on accounting and finance software and services, including some of our partners, resellers, and other parties with which we have relationships, may expand their services to compete with us.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
•level of customer satisfaction;
•ease of deployment and use of applications;
•ability to integrate with multiple legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications;
•domain expertise on accounting best practices;
•ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;
•capability for configurability, integration and scalability of applications;
•cloud-based delivery model;
•advanced security and reliability features;
•brand recognition and historical operating performance; and
•price and total cost of ownership.
We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. However, certain of our competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer and marketing relationships, larger marketing budgets, and significantly greater resources.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We currently have two patents. We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our intellectual property rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
Despite our efforts to preserve and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain portions of our software. Competitors may attempt to develop similar products that could compete in the same market as our products. Unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information by our employees or third parties could occur. Laws of other jurisdictions may not protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure in the same 
manner as the United States. The risk of unauthorized use of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as our company continues to expand outside of the United States.
Third-party infringement claims are also possible in our industry, especially as software functionality and features expand, evolve and overlap with other industry segments.
Human Capital
At December 31, 2020, we had 1,325 employees worldwide. Our employees contribute their unique talents, experience and backgrounds to help our customers move to modern accounting. We are committed to driving a culture of inclusion and innovation through programs designed to attract, develop and engage exceptional talent as part of our Think, Create, Serve ethos. 
Through ongoing employee development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety and employee wellbeing, we strive to cultivate an environment where employees can do their best work in our award-winning workplace, which the Los Angeles Business Journal included in its “Best Places to Work in Los Angeles” list in 2016, 2017, and 2020. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
Our board of directors is made up of highly skilled individuals from the technology and business sectors. Women represent 30% of our board of directors and 20% of our board of directors is drawn from underrepresented communities, as defined under the California Corporations Code.
At BlackLine we empower employees to think, create and serve in a workplace that is diverse and equitable, where everyone truly feels they belong. We are committed to providing an environment that is safe, inclusive, equitable, accepting, and supportive for all. How we treat one another—how we serve one another—is at our foundation. At BlackLine, employee resource groups ("ERGs") are open to all employees and support our diversity, equity and inclusion goals. Our ERGs include: women, people of color, LGBTQ+, veterans, and a faith-based group, all of which promote inclusion, belonging and innovation. 
Diversity, equity and inclusion are deeply rooted in our culture. We strive to attract, develop and engage exceptional talent. In 2020, BlackLine hired a Vice President of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion responsible for evaluating and strengthening our programs and initiatives worldwide. In 2020, we also launched a global program to raise awareness of and address unconscious bias across the organization, and began implementing psychometric and skill-based testing to reduce bias in the interview process. 
Compensation and Benefits
BlackLine strives to maintain a pay for performance compensation program that is competitive and appropriately balanced to attract, motivate, reward, and retain talent. We benchmark and set compensation based on our compensation philosophy, market data, employee’s role, experience, location, and performance. We also review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay practices are fair and equitable. In addition to competitive compensation, we offer our employees a wide range of benefits such as: comprehensive healthcare and wellness, competitive retirement, time off, and recognition opportunities. 
Community Involvement
BlackLine’s charitable program provides all employees with an opportunity to give back and to make a positive impact through Company-matched charitable giving and virtual volunteering. BlackLine proudly supports the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Feeding America, and UNICEF, among other charitable organizations. 
Employee Engagement
BlackLine regularly seeks input from employees, including through broad employee satisfaction surveys and pulse surveys on specific issues, intended to assess our degree of success in promoting an environment where employees are engaged, satisfied, productive and possess a strong understanding of our business goals. In 2020, 89% of our global employees participated in our annual engagement survey. In the survey, BlackLine received its 
top scores related to the company's future, creating an environment where people of diverse backgrounds can succeed, and our culture. 
Training and Development
We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities, self-directed learning, and support for continuing education through a tuition reimbursement program. Our 2020 objectives included to “Grow and cultivate a high-performance organization” and to “Deliver training to our people managers that improves their capabilities to support the development, growth, and high performance of our employees.” In 2020, BlackLine employees participated in instructor-led and self-directed learning related to BlackLine products, technical training, business, and development training. 
Employee Support During COVID-19
BlackLine has taken a proactive and supportive approach to helping its employees remain healthy and productive through the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently require that the vast majority of our employees work from home, using digital platforms and virtual collaboration tools to maintain productivity and to remain in contact with one another and our customers and business partners. To support and protect our employees, we have also instituted travel bans and restrictions, and have taken precautions in accordance with local laws and guidelines to protect the health and safety of the small number of employees who need to be in our offices to perform their roles. We have also adopted new employee benefits and wellbeing initiatives, including physical, emotional, mental, and social programming, a global employee assistance program, and work from home reimbursement. These programs were recently recognized by the CEO World Awards, which honored BlackLine in the category of “Company Work-From-Home Implementation of the Year.”
