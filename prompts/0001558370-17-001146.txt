ITEM 1.        BUSINESSHistory and Organization
     Gold Resource Corporation was organized under the laws of the State of Colorado on August 24, 1998. We are a producer of metal concentrates that contain gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc, and doré containing gold and silver at the Aguila Project in the southern state of Oaxaca, Mexico (“Oaxaca”). The Aguila Project includes the Aguila open pit mine, which ceased operations in February 2011, and the Arista underground mine, which is currently in operation. We also perform exploration and evaluation work on our portfolio of precious and base metal exploration properties in Oaxaca and Nevada, United States of America (“Nevada”) and continue to evaluate other properties for possible acquisition.
     In this report, “Company,” “our,” “us” and “we” refer to Gold Resource Corporation together with our subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.  See glossary on page 26 for additional definitions.
     We have two units in North America, the Oaxaca Mining Unit and the Nevada Mining Unit. The majority of our assets are located at our Oaxaca Mining Unit, located on our Aguila Project, including our Aguila milling and smelting facility and Arista underground mine. The Aguila milling and smelting facility produces metal concentrates and doré from ore mined from the Arista Mine. All of our production and revenue currently comes from our Oaxaca Mining Unit. 
     The Aguila Project includes approximately 30,074 hectares of mining concessions, an access road from a major highway, haul roads, a mill and smelting facility, and adjoining buildings, an assay lab, an open pit and underground mine, tailings facilities and other infrastructure. Please see Item 2. Properties for maps and additional information.
     We commenced mining and milling operations at the Aguila Project in July 2010. The mill is located approximately 0.5 kilometers from the Aguila open pit mine. During 2010, we also began development of an underground mine to access the Arista deposit’s vein system. The Arista underground mine is located approximately two kilometers from the mill. Mining of the open pit was essentially completed in 2010. Approximately one-half of the open pit material was processed in 2010 and the Company continued to process the stockpiles in 2016. The vast majority of our production from 2011 to present has been from the Arista Mine.
     In April 2014, we announced the completion of our initial reserve study. Please see Item 2. Properties, Proven and Probable Reserves for more information. 
     Our operations in Oaxaca are conducted through our Mexican subsidiary, Don David Gold Mexico S.A. de C.V. (“DDGM”). Our Nevada exploration and evaluation work is performed through two wholly-owned subsidiaries, GRC Nevada Inc. and Walker Lane Minerals Corp. (“Walker Lane”).
     Our principal executive offices are located at 2886 Carriage Manor Point, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80906, and our telephone number is (303) 320-7708. We maintain a website at www.goldresourcecorp.com and through a link on our website you can view the periodic filings that we make with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as well as certain of our corporate governance documents such as our code of ethics. 
    
Developments During 2016 
     For the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported revenue of $83.2 million, mine gross profit of $22.4 million and net income of $4.4 million. All of our revenue is from the Arista Mine in Mexico. Our annual 2016 production from the Aguila Mill totaled 27,628 gold ounces, 1,857,658 silver ounces, 1,035 copper tonnes, 4,049 lead tonnes and 14,302 zinc tonnes. In 2016, dividends distributed to shareholders totaled $0.03 per share or $1.7 million.

 Acquisitions
     Isabella Pearl Project: On August 12, 2016, we purchased Walker Lane, which owns a 100% interest in the Isabella Pearl project, a potential open pit heap leach project located in Mineral County, Nevada. The project contains third party estimated Proven and Probable Reserves of 191,400 gold ounces at an average grade of 2.18 grams per tonne (“g/t”) and is in advanced stages of engineering and production permitting.  
     Mina Gold: On August 12, 2016, we also purchased the Mina Gold property located in Mineral County, Nevada. The Mina Gold property contains an historic third party estimate of mineralized material totaling 1,606,000 tonnes grading 1.88 g/t gold and is within close proximity to the Company’s Isabella Pearl and Gold Mesa properties.
     See Note 2 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information.
         Oaxaca Mining Unit
     During 2016, we continued to develop the Arista underground mine, reaching Level 22 on the decline ramp by year end. We developed multiple stopes and working faces for mining, predominantly between Levels 14 to 22 during the year. Long-hole stoping and cut-and-fill mining methods were utilized.  Additionally, during 2016, we advanced a second decline ramp 680 meters from the Arista vein system to the Switchback vein system, both within the Arista Mine.  We reached Switchback in the fourth quarter crosscutting the Soledad and Susana veins which are the first of at least six veins in this area of the deposit.  This primary 460 level Switchback ramp bifurcated approximately 100 meters from the Switchback vein system with inclining and declining ancillary ramps to access the mineralization on several levels for mine development.
     The focus during 2017 is to develop numerous production levels at Switchback as we prepare ore blocks for bulk tonnage long-hole open stoping and/or cut and fill planned for the 2018 year.  We are targeting one full year of mine development at Switchback to provide maximum mining flexibility, before transitioning to the more bulk tonnage mining methods of stoping.  During 2017, the Company expects to process some ore from Switchback mine development. However, the Arista vein system’s ore will again be the primary extraction focus for the 2017 year.
     In October, we received the final permit to commence mining at our Alta Gracia Project’s Mirador Mine.  Alta Gracia is located approximately 15 kilometers northwest of the producing Arista Mine and Aguila Mill complex, all of which are located along a larger 55 kilometer north 70 west mineralized structural fault corridor which we control.  Extraction of leachable mineralization from the Mirador Mine is expected to commence in early 2017 and be trucked to and processed in the Aguila Mill’s agitated leach circuit. Initial mining rates target 100 to 200 tonnes per day and an initial mill processing rate of approximately 150 tonnes per day. Initial small scale production is targeting cash flow from which to further develop the Mirador Mine. The Mirador Mine has the potential to increase our future annual production by approximately 500,000 silver ounces and 1,000 gold ounces.  Our business plan is to have multiple mines feed the strategically located Aguila Mill.
    
Dividends 
     Since July 2010, we have paid a monthly dividend. During 2016, we paid one-sixth cent per share per month plus a special year-end dividend of one cent per share, which totaled $0.03 per share per year. Please see Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities for additional information.     Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance
     Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and facilities. For more information, please see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below. We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against risks that are typical in the operation of our

business in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to property loss, environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors, below for additional information.
    
Environmental Matters 
     We conduct our operations so as to protect the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Our operating mine has a reclamation plan in place that we believe meets all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2016, $2.4 million was accrued for reclamation costs relating to current and previously producing properties.Competitive Business Conditions
     The exploration for, and the acquisition of, gold and silver properties are subject to intense competition. Identifying and evaluating potential mining prospects is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. Due to our limited capital and personnel, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many other companies with regard to exploration and, if warranted, advancement of mining properties. Our present limited capital means that our ability to compete for properties to be explored and developed is limited. We believe that competition for acquiring mineral prospects will continue to be intense in the future.Government Regulations and Permits 
     In connection with mining, milling and exploration activities, we are subject to United States and Mexican federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including laws and regulations relating to protection of air and water quality, hazardous waste management and mine reclamation as well as the protection of endangered or threatened species. The department responsible for environmental protection in Mexico is Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (“SEMARNAT”), which is similar to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. SEMARNAT has broad authority to shut down and/or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with its environmental regulations or standards. Potential areas of environmental consideration for mining companies, including ours, include but are not limited to, acid rock drainage, cyanide containment and handling, contamination of water sources, dust and noise. 
     For our mill and mining operations at the Aguila Project, we have and intend to secure various regulatory permits from federal, state and local agencies. These governmental and regulatory permits generally govern the processes being used to operate, the stipulations concerning air quality and water issues, and the plans and obligations for reclamation of the properties at the conclusion of operations. We have received the required local community support for the Aguila Project in the area from which we are currently producing. 
     In connection with exploration activities in Nevada, we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing protection of the environment, including, but not limited to, the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Federal Land Policy and Management Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and related state laws. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. 
    
Customers
     During the year ended December 31, 2016, 88% of our revenue was generated from the sales of metals concentrates to Trafigura Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (“Trafigura”).  In the event that our relationship with Trafigura is interrupted for any reason, we believe that we would be able to locate another entity to purchase our metals concentrates. However, any interruption could temporarily disrupt the sale of our principal products and adversely affect our operating results. We periodically review our options for alternative sales outlets to mitigate the concentration of risk in case of any unforeseen disruptions.
