ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to “GB” and “GB Sciences” refers solely to GB Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and all references to “the Company,” “we”, “us” or “our” in this Annual Report refers to GB Sciences and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
The Company seeks to be an innovative technology and solution company that converts the cannabis plant into medicines, therapies and treatments for a variety of ailments. The Company is developing and utilizing state of the art technologies in plant biology, cultivation and extraction techniques, combined with biotechnology, and plans to produce consistent and measurable medical-grade cannabis, cannabis concentrates and cannabinoid therapies.
 Although we believe that maximum shareholder value will ultimately be achieved through the development, production and marketing of certified cannabinoid medicines, therapies and treatments, in order to generate cash flow and near-term profitability, we intend to cultivate and dispense cannabis for medical purposes in both Nevada and other states which permit such sales and in which we and our operating partners are able to obtain cultivation and dispensing licenses.
 We seek to become a trusted producer of consistent and efficacious medicinal strains and products, combining both cannabinoids and terpenes, which we intend to market in those states within the United States and in other countries where the sale of medical cannabis products are permitted. In addition, subject to obtaining Food and Drug Administrative (FDA) certification, we intend to market our cannabinoid based drug discoveries on a world-wide basis.
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 4, 2001, under the name “Flagstick Venture, Inc.” On March 28, 2008, stockholders owning a majority of our outstanding common stock approved changing our then name “Signature Exploration and Production Corp.” as our business model had changed. 

1

On March 13, 2014, we entered into a definitive assets purchase agreement for the acquisition of assets, including the Growblox™ cultivation technology which resulted in a change in our corporate name on April 4, 2014, from Signature Exploration and Production Corporation to Growblox Sciences, Inc. 
 
Effective December 12, 2016, the Company amended its Certificate of Corporation pursuant to shareholder approval as reported in the Form 8-K filed on October 14, 2016. Pursuant to the amendment the Company’s name was changed from Growblox Sciences, Inc. to GB Sciences, Inc. 
 
The Company is cultivating cannabis using innovative, but conventional methods in its wholly owned subsidiary, GB Sciences Nevada, LLC (“GBSN”). On January 4, 2017, GBSN received a State Registration Certificate (“Certificate”) for its 28,000-sq. ft. cannabis cultivation facility located in Las Vegas, NV. The receipt of the Certificate allows the Company to cultivate medical cannabis. Phase 1 of the GBSN cultivation facility opened with 200 grow lights. When all phases of construction are completed, the facility is expected to generate revenues approximately of $10 million. Completion of all Phases of this facility is dependent upon the availability of capital to complete construction. The Company has made completion of all Phases of this facility its number one priority.
 
On October 4, 2016, we acquired a 60% interest in a Nevada Medical Marijuana Production License with an option of up to 80%. A production license enables us to convert cannabis plants into to oils and extracts that are suitable for creating medical compounds as well as consumer products. This license is critical and essential to our plan of producing cannabis-based medicines, and must be integrated into our cultivation facility to ensure quality control standards and efficiency in our production of cannabis medicines. 
 
On March 31, 2017, we entered into an agreement with Arizona-based company, Kush Cups, to produce cannabis-infused products in the state of Nevada. Cannabis for production will be grown in our Cultivation Labs facility in Las Vegas, NV. We will distribute cannabis-infused Keurig-compatible K-Cups, hot and cold brew coffees as well as infused teas.
 
We expect our products to compete well in the marketplace because of the considerable efforts we have made in the plant genetics and tissue culturing of our proprietary strains of cannabis. And, we are the exclusive Nevada grower of Kyle Kushman's proprietary marijuana strains which have been highly rated top sellers in California. 
 
Our Business Strategy
 
GB Sciences intends to operate as an intellectual property company that will conduct its business through its subsidiaries. GB Sciences intends to own all patents and related technologies developed by it and its subsidiaries. In addition, the Company owns and will seek to own majority interests in each of its existing and future operating subsidiaries.
 
Although we believe that maximum shareholder value will ultimately be achieved through the development, production and marketing of certified cannabinoid medicines, therapies and treatments, in order to generate cash flow and near-term profitability we intend to cultivate and dispense cannabis for medical purposes in both Nevada and other states which permit such sales and in which we and our operating partners are able to obtain cultivation and dispensing licenses.
 
The completion of pre-clinical and clinical trials and FDA-approvals for a pharmaceutical product is traditionally a long and expensive process. However, we believe that strategic partnering and aggressive licensing of these products at early clinical stages can mitigate some of the risks. If we are able to obtain “orphan drug” or “breakthrough drug” fast track status, this would be very helpful in shortening the process; as is the use of the new adaptive design clinical trial strategy. In order to achieve the strategic goals for our Science division, we intend to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with respected, independent contract research organizations, medical schools and other researchers. To this end, in December 2014, we signed a letter of intent with NRC Research Institute, a respected contract research organization in California. It is contemplated that NRC will focus on designing Phase I/II studies in parallel to simultaneously evaluate safety and efficacy of therapeutics.
 
2

If we achieve successful outcomes of product prototypes and meet all of our intermediate clinical trial goals, we will seek to proceed with testing using the adaptive design clinical trial strategy that allows us to proceed more quickly through all three human trial phases in a single series. We would then apply for FDA approval. If and when one or more of our drugs, therapies or treatments are approved by the FDA, we will seek to market them either through our Products division or under joint ventures or licensing arrangements with major pharmaceutical companies.
 
There can be no assurance that we will ever be able to enter into any joint ventures or other arrangements with third parties to finance our drug development program or that if we are able to do so, that any of our projected therapies will ever be approved by the FDA. Even if we obtain FDA approval for a therapy, there can be no assurance that it could be successfully marketed or would not be superseded by another cannabis based therapy produced by one or more of our competitors. It also may be anticipated that even if we enter into a joint venture development with a financially stable pharmaceutical or institutional partner, we will still be required to raise significant additional capital in the future to achieve the strategic goals of our Science Division. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional capital on reasonable terms, if at all. If our Science Division fails to achieve its goal of producing one or more cannabis based pharmaceuticals or therapies, it would have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and business prospects.
 
Agreement with Growblox Sciences Puerto Rico
 
On May 7, 2015, the Company entered into certain agreements with Growblox Sciences, Puerto Rico, LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (“GBSPR”). GBSPR was formed and is being capitalized primarily by Cesar Cordero-Kruger, a prominent business executive and resident of Puerto Rico.
 
Under the terms of a commercialization agreement between the Company and GBSPR, the Company has granted to GBSPR the exclusive world-wide rights to all of our technology and intellectual property to:
 
(a)

manufacture, produce, lease and license our indoor series of controlled-climate indoor agricultural technology growing and cultivation chambers engineered and designed to produce medical grade cannabis and other plant extracts (the “Growblox Chambers”) and provide remote diagnostic monitoring and servicing of the Growing Chambers to third party growers and processors of hemp, cannabis and other plant extracts; 
 (b)

sell to the Company, for resale and distribution throughout the world, in all territories and jurisdictions (including states in the United States) where the sale and use of such products are permitted, any and all pharmaceutical raw materials and products as well as neutraceuticals and cosmeceutical skin care products derived from medical-grade cannabis and hemp raw materials that were cultivated and grown in Growblox Chambers; 
 (c)

use the trademarks and packaging developed by the Company to be used to identify all cannabis products grown in Growblox Chambers; 
 (d)

provide technical support for the licensing, permitting and other requisite applications for the cannabis business in Puerto Rico and related markets; 
 (e)

access all research supporting the Growblox Chambers and educational materials previously developed or collected in the future by the Company to the extent associated or used with GBSPR Business; and 
 (f)

access all of the dispensary related technology, proprietary information and contacts including, without limitation, technology, proprietary information, and contacts. 
 
All rights not granted to GBSPR under the commercialization agreement are retained by the Company and include the (i) right to conduct pre-clinical and clinical trials and ongoing research and development to create cannabis-based therapies for specific clinical conditions based on an understanding of how cannabinoids interact with the natural receptors in the human body; (ii) formulation of targeted combinations of active ingredients to combat specific conditions and diseases; (iii) use of proprietary cannabinoid formulations, to develop palliative and curative pharmaceutical treatment options and products for patients with certain critical diseases; (iv) exclusive right to sell, dispense and market cannabinoid and hemp based pharmaceutical raw materials and products as well as neutraceuticals and cosmeceutical skin care products throughout the world, either directly, through distributors or 

3

under other agreements with third parties; and (iv) right, directly, or through one or more of our subsidiaries (other than GBSPR), to cultivate, grow, dispense and sell medical-grade cannabis or marijuana in Nevada and Colorado.
 To the extent that GBSPR produces and sells to the Company for resale or distribution pharmaceutical raw materials and products, neutraceuticals and/or cosmeceutical skin care products derived from plants cultivated and grown in Growblox Chambers (collectively, the “Finished Products”), the Company has agreed to establish mutually acceptable transfer pricing between GBSPR and the Company for such Finished Products; failing which agreement, an independent third party will arbitrate such pricing and pricing policies. In the event that GBSPR is unable to fulfill 100% of the requirements of the customers for Growblox Chambers or Finished Products, GBSPR will subcontract such production to third parties that are reasonably acceptable to the Company. Neither the Company nor GBSPR may commercially sell (as opposed to leasing or licensing) Growblox Chambers without the consent of both parties.
 
The grant of rights under the commercialization agreement was subject to the condition that GBSPR obtain not less than $1.25 million of equity financing by no later than September 30, 2015, failing which we could unilaterally terminate the agreement. GBSPR failed to obtain the funds by September 30, 2015 required pursuant to the commercialization agreement. Furthermore, the delivery of the approved production version of the Growblox cultivation unit has not yet been completed and the unit has not been delivered for testing. The Company continues to work with GBSPR to finalize the production version of the GrowBLOX and develop an alternative plan for funding. As of this date, the Company has not cancelled the commercialization agreement and technology license with GBSPR, and would prefer to continue the relationship but, in the absence of a viable funding plan, the Company may cancel the agreements and seek alternative partners for the development and commercialization of the GrowBLOX Suite technology.
 
Upon consummation of the contemplated $1.25 million capitalization of GBSPR, the Company will be the majority owner of its equity, owning approximately 66% of the GBSPR membership interests; Mr. Cordero-Kruger will own approximately 15.9% of such membership interests, Dr. Andrea Small-Howard, a Director and Chief Technology Officer will own approximately 2.1% of such membership interests and Joseph J. Bianco, a GBSPR Board member will own approximately 8.3% of such membership interests. The remaining percentage of ownership of such membership interests will be owned by other non-related party investors. 
 
Under the terms of the GBSPR operating agreement, Mr. Cordero-Kruger is the managing member of GBSPR, entitled to designate a majority of the five member board of managers of GBSPR, and is delegated with the authority to manage the business of GBSPR, subject only to certain major decisions defined in the operating agreement (dealing primarily with matters of finance, related party transactions and amending agreements among the parties) which require unanimous approval of the Board or approval by the Company. The Company has designated Craig Ellins, President and CEO, and Joseph J. Bianco as members of the GBSPR Board.
 
The operating agreement also provides that the investors (including Mr. Cordero-Kruger) who have provided the maximum $1.25 million of capital to GBSPR will hold Class A membership interests that entitle them to exclusive rights to certain research and development tax credits available to residents of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Company and its affiliates and associates hold Class B membership interests, which are identical to the Class A membership interest, other than the right to the research and development tax credits.
 
Assuming it completes its initial $1.25 million capitalization, GBSPR may seek to raise an additional $4.75 million of capital in 2016 or thereafter to enable it to expand its business activities. The operating agreement provides that the terms of such additional financing, if undertaken, have to be unanimously approved by all members of the GBSPR board, including the Company’s designees. Under certain conditions, after three years, the operating agreement provides that Mr. Cordero-Kruger or his designated members of the GBSPR board may require the Company to acquire the remaining equity of GBSPR under a formula or consummate another liquidity event for the members of GBSPR. 
 
There can be no assurance that the proposed initial $1.25 million capitalization of GBSPR will be consummated, or that the contemplated $4.75 million of additional financing will be undertaken or completed upon terms and conditions that are acceptable to GBSPR, if at all. There can also be no assurance that the proposed business activities of GBSPR will be successful, the ongoing research and development will result in pre-clinical trials or 

4

clinical trials that will result in the production of any pharmaceutical or related products that will either be commercially accepted or permitted to be sold by the FDA or any other state or federal regulatory authority, or the Company will ever be able to purchase or be permitted to resell medical grade cannabis or other finished products.
 
Teco Cultivation Facility 
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary GB Sciences Nevada, LLC (“GBSN”) leases a warehouse facility at 3550 W. Teco Avenue, Las Vegas Nevada. On January 4, 2017, GBSN received a State Registration Certificate (“Certificate”) for its 28,000-sq. ft. cannabis cultivation facility located in Las Vegas, NV. The receipt of the Certificate allows the Company to cultivate medical cannabis. Phase 1 of the GBSN cultivation facility opened with 200 grow lights. When all phases of construction are completed, the facility is expected to generate revenues of $10 million. Completion of all Phases of this facility is dependent upon the availability of capital to complete construction. The Company has made completion of all Phases of this facility its number one priority.
Competition
 
The medical cannabis industry is subject to intense and increasing competition. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater capital resources, facilities and infrastructure then we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively in this market. These competitors include TerraTech Corp., Cannabis Science, Inc., Peak Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cannabis-Rx, Inc. and Nemus Biosciences, Inc. In addition, the development of therapies and pharmaceutical products based on extracts from the cannabis plant is being undertaken by a number of medical and educational institutions, including the University of Mississippi, which is the only U.S. based entity authorized by the Federal government to cultivate cannabis for research. Such institutions have significantly greater financial resources and facilities than we have
Intellectual Property
 
GB Sciences’ Drug Development Pipeline for Novel Cannabis-Based Therapies
 
To help our patients, GB Sciences is creating a pipeline for the development of novel medicines based on our own patent-pending formulations of chemicals extracted from the Cannabis plant. We recently formed Growblox Life Sciences, LLC and have retained Fenwick & West, a Silicon Valley based law firm focusing on life sciences and high technology companies with a nationally top-ranked intellectual property practice, to develop strategies for the protection of the Company's intellectual property. GB Sciences runs a lean drug development program by minimizing expenses including personnel, overhead, and fixed capital expenses (such as lab and diagnostic equipment) through strategic partnerships with Universities and Contract Research Organizations (CROs). Our partners bring both expertise and infrastructure at a reasonable cost to our program. During the drug discovery phase of our pipeline, our provisional patents to date have been invented as a collaboration between our Chief Science Officer, Dr. Andrea Small-Howard and Dr. Helen Turner, Dean of Natural Sciences and Mathematics at Chaminade University. Our end goal is not to take these novel formulations to market ourselves, because we know our limitations. Our goal is to be the perfect partner to those companies with greater resources and experience in the marketing and distribution of medications worldwide.
 
Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Growblox Life Sciences, LLC, GB Sciences has now filed three provisional patent applications on new therapies that are complex mixtures of compounds derived from cannabis, and it has licensed an additional approved patent. On October 11, 2016, the Company filed the first of several planned patent applications for life science inventions by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Growblox Life Sciences, LLC. The first provisional patent application covers cannabinoid-containing complex mixtures (“CCCM”) capable of enhancing dopamine secretion and protecting neurons from the mitochondria-induced free radical damage that occurs during disease progression in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy Body Dementia, and Huntington's disease, among others. Overall, there is a lack of good therapies available for these patients. As people are living longer, the numbers of these undertreated patients with neurodegenerative disorders are increasing. Fortunately, there is a common mechanism underlying these neurological disorders that our therapies address, and we are eager to continue the development of these medications. The Company plans to seek partners in the 

5

biopharmaceutical industry or alternative venture funding to advance these cannabis-based formulations to clinical testing and commercialization.
 
On December 13, 2016, Growblox Life Sciences, LLC licensed intellectual property from Makai Biotechnology, LLC. The patent underlying the license was issued by the USPTO in July of 2015, and claims therapeutic methods for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and associated pathologies through regulation of the cannabinoid receptor, TRPV1. TRPV1 can be regulated therapeutically by plant-based cannabinoids, which creates a plethora of potentially new therapeutic agents for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Licensing this TRPV1 patent underscores the Company’s drug discovery commitment to targeting the non-classical cannabinoid receptors, beyond the usual CB1 and CB2 receptors.
 
On February 1, 2017, we filed our second provisional patent application. Our second application protects cannabis-based complex mixtures (“CCCM”) for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory disorders, which are increasingly prevalent in our society and add more than $300 billion dollars to the healthcare burden in the US. Some of these disorders included in our patent application are Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), allergic asthma, COPD/asthma in adults, eczema, and dermatitis. Our therapies are designed to help patients in all of these groups by focusing on commonalities in inflammatory pathways that lead to significant pain and suffering for these patients. Both common and uncommon inflammatory disorders, ranging from chronic arthritis to acute responses to insect stings, are likely to be effectively targeted by this therapeutic approach.
 
On May 23, 2017, we filed our third provisional patent application for the treatment of chronic pain and heart therapies based on myrcene-containing complex mixtures ("MCCM"). Our third application describes the use of our myrcene-containing complex mixtures for the treatment of heart disease. Heart disease remains the number one cause of death in the US, and there have been no novel formulations on the market for heart disease in almost twenty years. In the US, the heart disease market is $316 billion dollars. Our formulations target the TRPV1 receptor that is protected under the approved patent that we licensed from Makai Biotechnology in December of 2016. 
 
Our third provisional patent application also addresses patients with chronic and neuropathic pain. Recently, many patients and their physicians have been expressing their dissatisfaction with currently-available pain medications. Growing public and government concerns regarding opioid abuse, make novel pain treatments a promising field of research and development. Our novel pain formulations are also substantially free of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), which minimizes their potential for abuse. Pain represents an estimated health burden of between $560 and $650 billion dollars for chronic pain and between $17 and $20 billion dollars for immunological/neuropathic pain in the US alone. 
 
Current Biopharmaceutical Projects
 
As described above, Growblox Life Sciences has already filed provisional patent applications to protect complex mixtures derived from the cannabis plant that address twenty-six different disease-specific formulations within its intellectual property portfolio. The Company will focus its resources on the development of three specific formulations: a) two formulations will be prepared for human pilot studies in the Nevada market and b) one formulation will be put through pre-clinical studies prior to an IND-filing for official FDA-registered clinical trials. To evaluate our intellectual portfolio and plan the next steps, Growblox Life Sciences, LLC signed a Consulting Services Agreement with Worldwide Clinical Trials, Inc. on March 6, 2017. These pre-IND consulting services will be performed by the Chief Medical Scientific Officer (CMSO) of Worldwide, Michael F Murphy, MD, PhD, as the representative of an extended Worldwide team. Dr. Murphy has participated in the IND application process (content and FDA meeting interface) for multiple small molecules and biologics with 19 therapeutic targets, across five divisions of the FDA: Division of Neurology Products, Division of Psychiatry Products, Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Rheumatology Products, and Division of Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Products. He has been directly responsible for the clinical development program, execution, and New Drug Application (NDA) filing of three compounds.
 
To select the three disease-specific formulations for further development from our current intellectual property portfolio, the Company held a Drug Development Strategy Meeting in Las Vegas on April 21, 2017 to review the 

6

scientific validation and market factors related to the twenty-six disease-specific formulations in our portfolio. The Drug Development Strategy Meeting was co-chaired by our Chief Science Officer, Dr. Andrea Small-Howard, and Dr. Michael Murphy, CMSO of Worldwide Clinical Trials. Other participants included the Board of Directors of GB Sciences and GB Sciences’ Drug Discovery Committee: Dr. Helen Turner (Dean of Natural Sciences and Mathematics at Chaminade University), Dr. Carlos Rios Bedoya (Dept. of Family Medicine, Michigan State University), Dr. Tony Ortiz (CEO & Scientific Director, NRC Research Institute), Dr. Alexander Stokes (Center for Cardiovascular Research, Univ. of Hawaii-John A Burns School of Medicine), Dr. Daniel Chueh (CMO & Clinical Global Leader, NRC Research Institute), and Dr. Cindy Orser (Chief Science Officer, DigiPath Labs). 
 
Based on the Drug Development Strategy Meeting and Worldwide Clinical Trials’ recommendations, the Company has decided to move forward on development of formulations for pilot human trials in Nevada for our formulations for patients with chronic pain and Parkinson’s disease. In addition, we plan to move forward on preclinical studies of our heart disease therapies. Dr. Michael Murphy and his team at Worldwide Clinical trials are assisting in the design of the pre-IND strategy for our heart formulations and they are drafting the clinical trial design for our pilot studies in Parkinson’s disease and analgesia.
 
It should be emphasized that we face significant hurdles in obtaining FDA approval and certification for our therapies. Not only is the FDA certification process for any proposed pharmaceutical both extremely expensive and time consuming, but the current policy and regulations of the Federal government and some of its agencies are that cannabis has no medical benefit. Despite current Federal policy, there are more than 500 clinical trials currently in process in the United States testing cannabis or marijuana, and they are registered on the FDA-regulated website at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Of these trials, approximately 188 are testing potentially positive clinical effects of cannabis-based therapies.
 
Medical cannabis has been shown in numerous trials to be an effective source of pain therapy and has been indicated as being effective in treating some conditions such as glaucoma, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, chemotherapy-induced nausea and certain seizure disorders. While the therapeutic effects of medical cannabis on these conditions have been well documented in the medical literature, many patients and their physicians have well-founded concerns regarding the consistency, safety and efficacy of medical cannabis that is available any most standard dispensaries. We will seek to alleviate these concerns and increase safety and efficacy through cultivating harvest-to-harvest consistency in the levels of active cannabinoids in our proprietary stains; eliminate harmful pesticides and fungicides in our Growblox Suites growing and curing system.
 
There is no assurance that the letters patent will be issued in the near future, if at all. Even if issued, there is no assurance that our patents will afford us with adequate protection for the intellectual property that we may develop.
 
Government Regulation and Federal Policy
 
Under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), the policies and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies are that cannabis (marijuana) is a stage 1 narcotic that is addictive and has no medical benefit. Accordingly, and a range of activities including cultivation and the personal use of cannabis is prohibited and subject to prosecution and criminal penalties. Unless and until Congress amends the CSA with respect to medical cannabis, there is a risk that the federal authorities may enforce current federal law, and we may be deemed to be engaged in producing, cultivating, or dispensing cannabis in violation of federal law, or we may be deemed to be facilitating the sale or distribution of drug paraphernalia in violation of federal law with respect to our Company’s business operations. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect our strategic goals, revenues and profits. The risk of strict enforcement of the CSA in light of Congressional activity, judicial holdings, and stated federal policy remains uncertain. See “Risk Factors” below. 
 The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case brought by San Diego County, California that sought to establish federal preemption over state medical cannabis laws. The preemption claim was rejected by every court that reviewed the case. The California 4th District Court of Appeals wrote in its unanimous ruling, “Congress does not have the authority to compel the states to direct their law enforcement personnel to enforce federal laws.” However, in another case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, as long as the CSA contains prohibitions against cannabis, under 

7

the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, the United States may criminalize the production and use of cannabis even where states approve its use for medical purposes.
 
In an effort to provide guidance to federal law enforcement, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has issued Guidance Regarding Cannabis Enforcement to all United States attorneys in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General David Ogden on October 19, 2009, in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on June 29, 2011 and in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013. Each memorandum provides that the DOJ is committed to the enforcement of the CSA, but, the DOJ is also committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent and rational way.
 
The August 29, 2013 memorandum provides updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement in light of state laws legalizing medical and recreational cannabis possession in small amounts.
 
The memorandum sets forth certain enforcement priorities that are important to the federal government:
 
•

Distribution of cannabis to children; 
 •

Revenue from the sale of cannabis going to criminals; 
 •

Diversion of medical cannabis from states where it is legal to states where it is not; 
 •

Using state authorized cannabis activity as a pretext of other illegal drug activity; 
 •

Preventing violence in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; 
 •

Preventing drugged driving; 
 •

Growing cannabis on federal property; and 
 •

Preventing possession or use of cannabis on federal property. 
 
The DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of cannabis for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address cannabis activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical cannabis and recreational cannabis in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits. Furthermore, H.R. 83, enacted by Congress on December 16, 2014, provides that none of the funds made available to the DOJ pursuant to the 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act may be used to prevent certain states, including Nevada and California, from implementing their own laws that authorized the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical cannabis.
 
In contrast to federal policy, there are currently 28 states and the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulations that recognize, in one form or another, legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. Many other states are considering similar legislation.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2017, we employed fifteen employees consisting of management and support staff.
