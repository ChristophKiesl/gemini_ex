Overview of Markets and Products
 
Electronics Markets Overview
 
The electronics world can be divided into power processing and signal processing.  Power processing consists of converting the electrical power provided by the power source into the appropriate voltage and amperage needed for the device using the power.  Signal processing consists of the myriad ways digital and analog signals are used in computing, communications, etc. 
 
In both power processing and signal processing end-user demand continues to motivate the electronics industry to produce products which:
  - operate with lower losses and/or at higher speeds;
 - are smaller in size; and
 - operate with higher reliability.
 
While these three requirements result in products of ever-increasing performance, these requirements also create a fundamental challenge for the designer to manage the heat generated by the system operating at higher speeds and/or higher power. Smaller assemblies further concentrate the heat and increase the difficulty of removing it.
 
This challenge is found at each level in an electronic assembly: at the integrated circuit level speeds are increasing and line widths are decreasing; at the circuit board level higher density devices are placed closer together on circuit boards; and at the system level higher density circuit boards are being assembled closer together.
 
The designer must resolve the thermal management issues or the system will fail. For every 10 degree Celsius rise in temperature above a threshold level, the reliability of a integrated circuit is decreased by approximately half. In addition, heat usually causes changes in parameters which degrade the performance of both active and passive electronic components.
 
To resolve thermal management issues the designer is primarily concerned with two properties of the materials which comprise the system: 1) thermal conductivity, which is the rate at which heat moves through materials, and 2) thermal expansion rate (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion or CTE) which is the rate at which materials expand or contract as temperature changes. The designer must ensure that the temperature of an electronic assembly stays within a range in which the differences in the expansion rates of the materials in the assembly do not cause a failure from breaking, delaminating, etc.
 
CPS combines at the microstructural level a ceramic with a metal to produce a metal matrix composite which has the thermal conductivity needed to remove heat, and a thermal expansion rate which is sufficiently close to other components in the assembly to ensure the assembly is reliable. The ceramic is silicon carbide (SiC), the metal is aluminum (Al), and the composite is aluminum silicon carbide (AlSiC), a metal-matrix composite. CPS can adjust the thermal expansion rate of AlSiC components to match the specific application by modifying the amount of SiC compared to the amount of Al in the component.  The Company also has the capability of encapsulating Pyrolytic Graphite inserts to enhance the thermal conductivity of the AlSiC composite.
 
CPS produces products made of AlSiC in the shapes and configurations required for each application, for example, in the form of lids, substrates, housings, etc. Every product is made to a customer’s blueprint. The CPS process technology allows most products to be made to net shape, requiring no or little final machining.
 
Although the Company’s focus today is on AlSiC components, it believes its proprietary Quickset- Quickcast process technology can be used to produce other metal-matrix composites to meet future market needs.
 
An important development in power processing is the emergence of wide-band gap semiconductors, particularly SiC semiconductors.  SiC chips are more efficient than Si chips and are being used more frequently in power applications.  Modules using SiC chips run at higher temperatures, increasing the need for improved thermal management, need which the Company’s products meet.
 
Armor and Structural Markets Overview
 
Vehicle armor has traditionally been steel panels.   As threat levels have increased the amount of steel required to provide ballistic protection has reached a point where the weight degrades the vehicle’s performance.  The U.S. military has increasingly used ceramic armor in weight sensitive applications.  However, ceramic armor has several limitations, including limited multi-hit capability.   By embedding ceramic armor tiles in a metal matrix, these problems are overcome; the result is vehicle armor that is light-weight, has excellent ballistic protection, and environmental durability. 
 
The Company’s HybridTech Armor panels are particularly well suited for extreme environments – the panels don’t degrade in salt spray, or near heat, for example, and for high threat levels wherein steel does not provide the needed level of protection.  The Company believes its armor panels will increasingly be used in these applications.
 Structural applications perform primarily a mechanical rather than electrical function. In any mechanical assembly with moving parts the stiffness and weight of moving parts can have a significant impact on the performance and energy efficiency of the assembly. In particular, in equipment with reciprocating components increasing the stiffness and reducing the weight of reciprocating components improves the performance and energy efficiency of the equipment.
 
Today many mechanical components are made of steel because steel has the stiffness required for the particular application. AlSiC has approximately the same stiffness as steel, but is only one-third the weight of steel. AlSiC is higher cost than steel. However, we believe there are many mechanical applications where the customer will pay the higher cost for AlSiC because of significant improvements in performance resulting from the superior stiffness-to-weight ratio of AlSiC.
 
Examples of structural applications for which we have developed and supplied components include robotic arms for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and stiffeners for satellites. 
 
Specific Markets and Products
 
Motor Controller Applications (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor ("IGBT") Applications)
 
The electrification of the economy – particularly the use of electric motors and power modules to control electric motors of all sizes - is growing. This growth is the result of several factors including emerging high-power applications which demand power controllers such as trains, subways and certain industrial equipment, and cost declines in power modules which increasingly make variable speed drives cost effective. Power semiconductors are a very significant portion of the cost of variable speed drives, and the cost of the module housing and thermal management system are also significant; declines in the costs of all these components is driving increased use of variable speed drives.
 
We provide baseplates and heat spreaders on which power semiconductors are mounted to produce modules for motor control. The power semiconductors are typically IGBTs and these applications are often referred to as IGBT applications. Our AlSiC baseplates have sufficient thermal conductivity to allow for removal of heat through the baseplate and have a thermal expansion rate sufficiently similar to the other components in the assembly to ensure reliability over time as the assembly thermally cycles. We believe this market will continue to grow as the use of power modules penetrates additional motor applications, and as electric motors themselves penetrate new applications such as the hybrid and electric vehicles.
 
Today our primary products for IGBT applications are used in electric trains, subway cars, wind turbines and hybrid and electric vehicles.
 
Major automobile companies around the world are introducing hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and electric vehicle (EVs) at an increasing rate. This focus on more energy efficient vehicles is being driven by concerns about climate change. There are many varieties of HEVs and EVs, but all HEVs and EVs contain an electric motor and contain one or more motor controller modules. The Company provides baseplates on which motor controller modules are assembled; these baseplates are lighter weight and provide greater reliability than baseplates made from more conventional materials.
 
The Company is working with multiple tier one and tier two suppliers to the automobile industry on several new designs for future introduction. The Company believes the HEV and EV markets will be the source of significant and long-term growth for the Company.
 
Lids and Heat Spreaders for High-Performance Microprocessors, Application-Specific Integrated Circuits and Other Integrated Circuits ("Flip-chip Applications")
 
Increases in speed, circuit density, and the number of connections in graphics processors (GPUs), microprocessor chips (CPUs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are accelerating a transition in the way in which these circuits are packaged. Packages provide mechanical protection to the integrated circuit (IC), enable the IC to be connected to other circuits via pins, solder bumps or other connectors, and allow attachment of a heat sink or fan to ensure the IC does not overheat. In the past most high-performance ICs were electrically connected to the package by fine wires in a process known as wire bonding. Today, most high-performance semiconductors are connected to the package by placing metal bumps on the connection points of the die, turning the die upside down in the package, and directly connecting the bumps on the die with corresponding bumps on the package base by reflowing the bumps. This is referred to as a "flip-chip package". Flip chip packages allow for connection of a larger number of leads in a smaller space, and can provide other electrical performance advantages compared to wire bonded packages.
 
In many flip chip configurations a lid or heat spreader is placed over the die to protect the die from mechanical damage and to facilitate the removal of heat from the die. Often a heat sink or fan is then attached to the lid. For a high-density die the package designer must ensure that the lid has sufficient thermal conductivity to remove heat from the die and that all components of the package assembly - the die itself, the package base, and the package lid - are made from materials with sufficiently similar thermal expansion rates to ensure the assembly will not break apart over time as it thermally cycles.
 
Our composite material, AlSiC, has been developed to meet these two needs: it is engineered to have sufficient thermal conductivity to allow the heat generated by the die to be removed through the lid, and it is engineered to expand upon heating at a rate similar to other materials used in the package assembly in order to ensure reliability of the package over time as it thermally cycles. We produce lids made of AlSiC for high performance microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits used in servers, internet switches and other applications.
 
Most participants in the semiconductor industry believe the densities of ICs will continue to increase following the well-known "Moore’s Law". As IC densities increase, generally so does the IC size, and the amount of heat generated by the IC. We believe the need for thermal management will continue to grow rapidly.
 
Customers
 We sell primarily to major microelectronics systems houses in the United States, Europe and Asia. Our customers typically purchase prototype and evaluation quantities of our products over a one to three year period before purchasing production volumes.
 In 2020, our three largest customers accounted for 36%, 21%, and 16% of revenues, respectively. In 2020, approximately 87% of our revenues were derived from commercial applications and 13% from defense-related applications.
 Availability of Raw Materials
 We use a variety of raw materials from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers. These materials are primarily aluminum ingots, ceramic powders and chemicals. The raw materials we use are available from domestic and foreign sources and none is believed to be scarce or restricted for national security reasons.  We use no conflict metals.
Patents and Trade Secrets
 As of December 26, 2020, the Company had 11 United States patents.  In addition the Company had several international patents covering the same subject matter as the U.S. patents. Licensees of these patents have rights to use certain patents as defined in their respective license agreements.
 We intend to continue to apply for domestic and foreign patent protection in appropriate cases. In other cases, we believe we are better served by reliance on trade secret protection. In all cases, we seek protection for our technological developments to preserve our competitive position.
 Backlog and Contracts
 Over 90% of the Company's product sales are custom in that they are based on customers’ drawings and the large majority of these sales are "designed in" and are sold over multiple years. Major customers typically give the Company a non-binding forecast of demand for a one-year period and then negotiate a pricing agreement with the Company valid for that one-year period. Each week customers then issue releases or authorizations to ship under the pricing agreements. At any point in time the contractually binding backlog represented by the releases in hand does not necessarily reflect underlying demand. Given this situation, the Company does not believe backlog data are meaningful.
Competition
 We have developed and expect to continue to develop products for a number of different end markets and we will encounter competition from different producers of metal-matrix composites and other competing materials.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors in our end markets today include technical competence, product performance, quality, reliability, price, delivery performance, corporate reputation, and strength of sales and marketing resources. We believe our proprietary processes, reputation, and the price at which we can offer products for sale will enable us to compete successfully in the many electronics end markets.

 Our primary direct competitor in metal matrix composites is Denka, a large chemical company based in Japan.  We see manufacturers in China seeking to penetrate our markets. We believe they offer their products at lower prices but have generally not yet been to be able to provide the delivery, performance, quality and reliability required by the market.
 Government Regulation
 We produce non-nuclear, non-medical hazardous waste in our development and manufacturing operations. The disposal of such waste is governed by state and federal regulations. Various customers, vendors, and collaborative development agreement partners of CPS may reside abroad, thereby possibly requiring export and import of raw materials, intermediate products, and finished products, as well as potential technology transfer abroad under collaborative development agreements. These types of activities are regulated by bureaus within the Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury.
Employees
 As of December 26, 2020, we had 104 permanent full-time employees. 95 were engaged in manufacturing and engineering and 9 in sales and administration, including finance, HR and general management.
 None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be excellent.
