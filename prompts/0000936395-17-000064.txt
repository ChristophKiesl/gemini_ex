Industry Background 
Network Traffic Growth and Increased Capacity Requirements
The markets in which we sell our communications networking solutions have seen significant changes in recent years. In particular, optical networks – which carry video, data, and voice traffic by encoding digital information on multiple wavelengths of light traveling across fiber optic cables – have experienced strong traffic growth for several years. This growth in bandwidth demand, and the resulting requirements for increased network capacity and transmission speeds, is being driven by the rapid proliferation and increased reliance upon a diverse set of communications services and applications. These services and applications, including those set forth below, are redefining the bandwidth and service demands placed upon networks, and are challenging the business models and infrastructures of many network operators.

• | Cloud-Based Services. Enterprises and consumers continue to replace locally-housed computing by adopting a broad array of innovative cloud-based models – including Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) – and an expanding range of cloud-based services that host key applications, store data, enable the viewing and downloading of content, and utilize on-demand computing resources.


• | Over-the-Top (OTT) Services and Video Streaming. OTT content refers to video, multimedia and other applications provided directly from the content source to the viewer or end user across a third-party network. Traffic from streaming and OTT services, including high definition and ultra-high definition video, has expanded with the increased availability of, and end-user demand for, video content accessible through a variety of devices and media.


• | On-Demand Services. Users of communications services are requiring an on-demand service level that allows them to be connected wherever and whenever they desire. Businesses rely upon enterprise services and data center connectivity that facilitate global operations, employee mobility and access to critical business applications and data. Consumers expect broadband services, including peer-to-peer internet applications, augmented reality applications and multimedia streaming and downloads, to be available on-demand.


• | Mobile Devices and Applications. Traffic from mobile applications, including video, internet and data services, has expanded with the proliferation of smartphones, tablets and other wireless devices. Because much of the wireless traffic ultimately travels across a wireline network to reach its destination, growth in mobile communications continues to place demands upon wireline networks, including backhaul and fronthaul networks emanating from cell sites.

In addition, emerging services and applications are likely to present further challenges for and place significant service, capacity and automation demands upon network infrastructures. These include:

• | Network Densification. Network operators will be required to adopt next-generation network standards in order to cost-effectively accommodate increased bandwidth and service demands from emerging wireless and cable initiatives and to deliver greater capacity closer to the end users. Fifth-Generation wireless broadband technology (5G) is expected to enable significant increases in data consumption by a growing number of users and devices, thereby better supporting what some refer to as the “Internet of Things” and other emerging applications. “Fiber deep” initiatives by cable and multiservice operators are designed to push fiber closer to the end-user, increasing potential bandwidth to homes and enterprises while addressing power, space and maintenance costs. Implementation of these initiatives is expected to affect wireline networks significantly, particularly in access networks and mobile backhaul applications. 


• | Internet of Things. As the number of networked connections between devices and servers grows, machine-to-machine-related traffic (M2M) is expected to represent an increasing portion of traffic as the Internet of Things evolves. These connections can provide value-added services and allow sharing of data that can be monitored and analyzed. We

5

expect network traffic relating to the interconnection of devices to grow as internet and cloud-based content delivery, smart grid applications, health care and safety monitoring, resource and inventory management, home entertainment, consumer appliances, connected transportation, and other M2M data applications become more widely adopted.

• | Ultra-High Definition TV and Virtual and Augmented Reality. Ultra-high definition TV and the advent of immersive technologies like 360° video, virtual reality, and augmented reality are likely to place meaningful capacity and capability demands on networks as adoption of these technologies grows. The television, internet and consumer electronics industries are rapidly advancing these technologies and making them more widely available and affordable to consumers.

We believe that increased adoption of these services and applications, along with the desire to provide content and service delivery closer to the end user for an improved quality of experience, will require network operators to adopt higher capacity networks with increased transmission speeds, particularly in regional and metropolitan networks.
Network Transition to Open, Programmable Networks
The dynamics discussed above, together with ongoing efforts by network operators to reduce network costs and promote flexibility, are causing our customers to adopt next-generation infrastructures that are more open, programmable and automated. Network operators are increasingly leveraging information technology (IT) strategies that emphasize software capability, virtualization and standardized network solutions in order to adapt more quickly to changing end-user demands, and to deliver efficiently a wider range of revenue-generating services. We expect these new network infrastructure strategies to include one or more of the following:

• | Orchestration and Automation. Software-based orchestration simplifies the end-to-end creation, automation and deployment of services across multiple physical and virtual network domains. We believe software-based orchestration presents an opportunity to reduce network complexity and offers an alternative to certain elements of traditional operations support and business support systems, which network operators have historically relied upon to support network management functions such as inventory, service provisioning, network configuration and fault management.


• | Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Through NFV, network operators can decouple physical network assets from the services or capabilities they provide. We believe that NFV can decrease power and space requirements, reduce cost, and improve network flexibility and agility by eliminating costly, single-function network appliances and enabling these functions via software and general computing hardware and servers.


• | Software-Defined Networking (SDN). SDN seeks to simplify networks to create more open environments that ease management, support automation, and quickly deliver customized services to end users, by enabling individual network elements to be directly programmable by standards-based software control. This results in end-to-end visibility of network flows, enabling the ability to optimize traffic paths and control data flows through a network.

We believe that adoption of these strategies will require network operators, and their network solutions vendors, to increasingly look to utilize an ecosystem of physical and virtual network resources. We expect that these network architectural approaches, in turn, will drive increased openness and interoperability of multi-vendor, multi-domain network environments, requiring an increased degree of cooperation, collaboration and interoperability among us and other solutions providers, including our competitors.
Different Approaches to Procurement of Network Infrastructure
The industry dynamics described above are leading network operators to consider a diverse range of approaches, or “consumption models,” to manage the design and procurement of their network infrastructures. These consumption models can include: the traditional systems procurement of fully integrated solutions including hardware, software and services from the same vendor; the procurement of a fully integrated hardware solution from one vendor with the separate use of a network operator’s own or another vendor’s SDN-based control; the procurement of an integrated photonic line system with open interfaces from one vendor and the separate or “disaggregated” procurement of modem technology from a different vendor; or the use of published reference designs and open source specifications for the procurement of off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware (often referred to as “white box” hardware) to be used with open source software. In parallel, network operators are also exploring procurement alternatives for software solutions, ranging from integrated and proprietary software platforms to fully open source software.
6

We believe that network operators will pursue a variety of different consumption models. Many of these approaches continue to be in their early stages of evaluation, and the models that ultimately emerge and their level of adoption will depend in significant part on the circumstances and strategies of particular network operators. We also believe that broader adoption of procurement models involving greater disaggregation remains uncertain, particularly for those network operators for whom such an approach would result in increased operational complexity, expense, and integration and support obligations. Based on our views of the market and customer interactions, we expect that the largest portion of deployed capacity, for at least the next few years, will continue to be through the purchase of fully integrated hardware solutions. We expect that customer consideration of a variety of consumption models will require network operators and vendors alike to assess, and possibly broaden, their existing commercial models over time. We also believe that these dynamics will place a premium on a vendor’s ability to accommodate multiple consumption models and to balance the provision of commercially robust network solutions with the maximum amount of flexibility and choice.
Strategy 
In the context of the foregoing current market dynamics, our strategy to leverage our technology leadership, diversify and expand our addressable market, and drive the profitable growth of our business includes the following initiatives:
Promote Choice and Openness. Our philosophy is rooted in enabling choice in the market by developing network technologies that facilitate openness through innovation, virtualization, automation and collaboration. Choice is an increasingly important element of our customers’ efforts to keep pace with bandwidth and infrastructure demands, and the need to manage network costs. Our technology heritage and investment capacity in forward innovation position us well to offer an expansive range of choice to our customers – including our packet-optical convergence, coherent modem leadership and merchant modem strategy, and multi-vendor network orchestration, management and control through our Blue Planet software platform. By offering collaborative tools and environments, including our Emulation Cloud and DevOps Toolkit, we enable the development, testing and customization of services and applications. Our desire to promote choice also influences our go-to-market approach. We expect to increasingly partner with an ecosystem of integrators, solutions vendors and virtual network function providers to address services and applications across multi-vendor and multi-domain networks. We also intend to offer solutions and pursue opportunities across a range of customer consumption models in order to drive the evolution of next-generation network infrastructures and to increase choice and openness.
Extend Technology Leadership and Expand Application of Our Solutions. We are focused on providing market leading technology offerings that expand our role and the application of our solutions in customer networks. We seek to force the pace of innovation in our industry and to extend our coherent modem technology leadership. In 2017 we launched WaveLogic Ai, our next-generation programmable coherent modem that significantly improves transport network economics and flexibility across a broad set of network applications. We also recently introduced Liquid Spectrum, an integrated solution offering that combines WaveLogic Ai and our Blue Planet software. We are also focused on introducing Converged Packet Optical and Packet Networking solutions that offer greater transmission speeds and that expand the capacity and service delivery capabilities of access and metro networks, data center interconnect, submarine networks, and other WAN applications. 
Leverage Blue Planet for Automated Networks. To address the various challenges faced by network operators, we seek to promote our Blue Planet software as an intelligent automation platform that we believe is capable of transforming network operations and management. Our Blue Planet software platform is designed to automate, orchestrate, and manage physical network resources and virtualized services across data centers and the WAN. We believe that Blue Planet can transform legacy networks into “service ready” networks, accelerating the creation, delivery and lifecycle management of new, cloud-based services. Analytics and machine learning technology are also critical components of our automation strategy, and we have introduced analytics capabilities aimed at delivering measurable business improvements to the planning, operations, and utilization of transport networks. 
We are implementing a new go-to-market strategy for our Blue Planet software platform, with an enhanced focus on selling the software as one component of an overall software and software-related service solution. This solutions-based selling approach seeks to leverage our insights into our customers’ common networking issues, and to use those insights to help drive creative and efficient solutions using our Blue Planet and software-related service capabilities. We intend to leverage the transition from our legacy network management solutions to our Blue Planet Manage, Control and Plan (MCP) network domain controller to position us for additional Blue Planet applications, including orchestration and analytics solutions. 
Capture Merchant Modem Business Opportunities. To further leverage our technology leadership and expand our addressable market, we have taken steps to enter the market for merchant modem sales opportunities. Merchant modems, often called transponders, are the combination of an optical chipset or ASIC with other key optical components that are sold 
7

independent of integrated systems. Merchant modem vendors often sell their modem technology in the form of an optical module or pluggable component to a variety of market participants, including some of our system vendor competitors. To pursue this strategy, we have entered into global distribution relationships to supply our WaveLogic coherent optical modem technology to leading component vendors Lumentum, NeoPhotonics and Oclaro. Through these relationships, we believe that we can further our efforts to diversify our business and expand our addressable market to include new geographies and market segments, while enabling greater choice for network operators in offering an alternative to merchant modems currently in the market.
Increase Diversification of Our Business. We believe that continued diversification of our business is important to address the dynamic industry environment in which we operate, to continue to grow our business, and to better withstand potential slowdowns adversely affecting particular geographies, markets, or customer segments. Our strategy is to increase adoption of our packet access and aggregation solutions, and to secure and grow market share with our Blue Planet software platform and merchant modem initiatives, while also pursuing opportunities with a diverse set of network operators in growth customer segments and geographies. Our go-to-market strategy seeks to capture additional market share with current customers and other internet content providers, data center operators, and emerging network operators, and to displace competitors in international markets, particularly Asia-Pacific. We intend to use our direct and indirect sales channels to expand our sales with several other market verticals, including cable and multiservice operators, submarine network operators, enterprise customers and in the government and research and education (R&E) markets.

These products provide for optical transport, traffic aggregation at the network edge, and switching that is optimized for handoff at the network core.
Leveraging our Wavelogic coherent modem technology, we are taking steps to pursue merchant modem sales opportunities through our Optical Microsystems division. These activities principally include our distribution relationships with optical component suppliers Lumentum, NeoPhotonics and Oclaro for our coherent modem technology. To date, we have not generated revenue from sales through these partnerships; however, such sales will be reflected within the Converged Packet Optical product line of our Networking Platforms segment.
Packet Networking. Our Packet Networking products allow customers to simplify their network designs while scaling the deployment and delivery of new, revenue-generating services to both consumer and business end users. These products have applications from the network edge, where packet-based services are terminated, to the metro and core networks, where they aggregate and switch traffic to support such applications as Ethernet business services, mobile backhaul services, as well as ongoing network infrastructure scaling. Our Packet Networking products facilitate network simplicity and cost effectiveness, including reduced costs associated with power and space, as compared to more complex traditional IP routing network designs. 
To date, revenue from our Packet Networking segment has been primarily related to our 3000 family of Service Delivery Switches, and our 5000 family of Service Aggregation Switches. Our 3000 and 5000 families support the access and aggregation tiers of communications networks and have principally been deployed to support business data services and wireless backhaul applications. Our 3000 family of Service Delivery Switches are purpose-built to fit small, medium and large customer sites as well as multi-tenant office and residential buildings. Our 5000 family of Service Aggregation Switches provide aggregation to fill higher capacity links efficiently within both the metro access and aggregation tiers of networks, minimizing the number of router assets required in the core. The recent introduction of our 3000 family of Service Virtualization Switches allows for customers to migrate towards software-based networking and services based on Network Function Virtualization.
Our Packet Networking portfolio also includes our 8700 Packetwave Platform, a multi-terabit packet switching platform for high-density metro networks and inter-data center wide area networks. The 8700 combines high-capacity packet switching and coherent DWDM optical transport technologies for both data center networks and metro networks, to help network 
9

operators rapidly deliver cloud-based services, streaming video, and internet content distribution, efficiently aggregate users, and provide express connections to data centers. By increasing the traffic density while reducing power and space requirements, the 8700 also enables network operators to reduce capital and operating expense associated with their networks and to simplify service management and enablement. 
Optical Transport. Our Optical Transport products include stand-alone WDM and SONET/SDH-based optical transport solutions that are used in metro and regional networks and enable cost-effective and efficient transport of voice, video and data traffic at high transmission speeds. The products in this segment principally include the 4200 Advanced Services Platform, Corestream® Agility Optical Transport System, 5100/5200 Advanced Services Platform, Common Photonic Layer (CPL) and 6100 Multiservice Optical Platform. As of the end of fiscal 2017, our Optical Transport products have either been previously discontinued, or are expected to be discontinued, reflecting network operators’ transition toward next-generation converged network architectures and stackable interconnect platforms addressed by solutions within our Converged Packet Optical product line. Accordingly, commencing in fiscal 2018, sales of Optical Transport will be reflected within the Converged Packet Optical product line of our Networking Platforms segment.
Software and Software-Related Services
Historically, our software business principally consisted of element and network management software and software-related services that support our hardware offerings. As a result of our acquisition of Cyan, we refocused our software initiatives toward next-generation, multi-vendor network virtualization, service orchestration and management applications oriented around our Blue Planet software platform. 
Blue Planet Platform. Our Blue Planet software is an open, intelligent automation platform that allows service providers to use deep knowledge about the network to power adaptive optimization of their services and operations. Blue Planet facilitates the evolution toward more efficient, modernized network operations and software-defined programmability to accelerate the delivery of on-demand services, reduce costs and enable a path to increased network autonomy. The Blue Planet platform is a cohesive system combining multi-domain service orchestration, analytics, and SDN in a common microservices-based architecture. Blue Planet products can be deployed individually or in any combination and include: 

• | Manage, Control and Plan (MCP). Blue Planet MCP software provides SDN-based domain control of Ciena's next-generation packet and optical networks, including equipment commissioning, service provisioning, assurance and performance monitoring. Operations are greatly automated and simplified through MCP’s open programmatic APIs and its intuitive GUI. This enables granular resource management and control, and the ability to plan networks efficiently and effectively to meet customer service needs. Built on Blue Planet's open, extensible microservices-based architecture, MCP marks a strategic shift from legacy, fragmented network management software, leading the transformation to programmable cloud-native operations that easily integrate into operators’ business processes.


• | Multi-Domain Service Orchestration (MDSO). Network infrastructures are comprised of multiple technology layers and domains — such as the data center, cloud, metro, access and core networks — and it is often complex for network operators to offer services end-to-end in this environment. Blue Planet enables service orchestration across multiple network (physical and virtual) domains and multiple hardware and software vendors. By using open APIs and intent-based, model-driven templates, Blue Planet simplifies end-to-end services lifecycle management and increases service velocity by abstracting the complexity of underlying domains. We believe our MDSO solution can enable network operators to minimize vendor-specific management silos, reduce network complexity and improve end-to-end service visibility and control.


• | NFV Orchestration (NFVO). To reduce their dependence upon single-purpose hardware platforms and accelerate the time to market for new revenue-generating services, network operators are increasingly looking for solutions that enable network functions through software that runs on industry-standard servers, network and storage platforms. Blue Planet provides network operators with carrier-grade, NFV management and orchestration capabilities for instantiating and managing virtualized network functions and data center resources. Blue Planet uses an open, vendor-agnostic approach that allows network operators to select and scale those virtual network functions (VNFs) they wish to offer to their end customers. We believe that our NFVO solution can enable network operators to increase network programmability, reduce complexity and cost, and reduce time-to-market with new, revenue-generating services.


• | Analytics. Blue Planet Analytics incorporates big data analytics and machine-learning innovations for generating deep insights into the network, thereby helping operators make smarter, data-driven business decisions. Analytics consists of two components: a robust and flexible framework for collecting, processing, and storing data from multiple sources across the network; and upper-layer analytics applications that leverage machine learning innovations. This design approach gives operators the ability to visualize and identify trends to create more profitable services, better predict

10

capacity requirements, and anticipate potential network and service disruptions before they happen. The related Network Health Predictor application provides preemptive network maintenance across the optical, Ethernet, and IP layers of the network.
The market relating to these automation capabilities is in the early stages and, as such, revenue from our Blue Planet software has not been significant to date.
Element and Network Management Solutions and Software. Our software offerings also include our OneControl Unified Management System used by network operators in connection with our networking platforms. This integrated network and service management solution supports our Converged Packet Optical, Packet Networking and Optical Transport product lines from a single platform. OneControl offers end-to-end service creation, activation, and assurance to enable rapid deployment of next-generation wavelength, OTN and packet services. It also provides visualization of fault and performance information for network health status and enables management functions, including network inventory, network element configuration backup, network element software delivery and security administration. Our element and network management software offering also includes a number of legacy software solutions that support our installed base of network solutions. Our software suite includes Ciena OnePlanner, a suite of planning tools for advanced, multi-layer network design. OnePlanner correlates data from different network layers, allowing the network planner to easily see the connection between services, facilities, and equipment. 

Software-Related Services. To complement our software portfolio, we offer a range of software-related services including software subscription services, consulting, network migration and integration, installation and upgrade support services, and technical support relating to our software offerings.

We also maintain a global channel program that involves resellers, systems integrators, service providers, and other third-party distributors, who market and sell our products and services. Our strategic third-party channel partners include Ericsson and TE SubCom for our systems, as well as optical component suppliers Lumentum, NeoPhotonics and Oclaro for our coherent modem technology. We see opportunities to leverage these relationships to address new customer segments, additional applications for our solutions, and new geographies, while reducing the financial and operational risk of entering these additional markets.
To support our sales efforts, we engage in marketing activities to generate demand for our products and services. Our marketing strategy is highly focused on building our brand to create customer preference for Ciena, engaging in thought leadership programs to illustrate how our innovations solve customer business problems, and enabling our sales teams to drive customer adoption of our solutions. Our marketing team supports our sales efforts through a variety of activities, including direct customer interaction, account-based marketing campaigns, portfolio marketing, industry events, media relations, industry analyst relations, social media, trade shows, our website and other marketing vehicles for our customers and channel partners.
Operations and Supply Chain Management
Our operations personnel manage our relationships with our third-party manufacturers and global supply chain, addressing component sourcing, manufacturing, product testing and quality, and fulfillment and logistics relating to the distribution and support of our products.
12

We utilize a global sourcing strategy that emphasizes procurement of materials and product manufacturing in lower cost regions. We rely upon third-party contract manufacturers, with facilities in Canada, Mexico, Thailand and the United States, to manufacture, support and ship our products, and therefore are exposed to risks associated with their businesses, financial condition and the geographies in which they operate. We also rely upon these contract manufacturers and other third parties to perform design and prototype development, component procurement, full production, final assembly, testing and distribution operations. Our manufacturers procure components necessary for assembly and manufacture of our products based on our specifications, approved vendor lists, bills of materials and testing and quality standards. Our manufacturers’ activity is based on rolling forecasts that we provide to them to estimate demand for our products. This build-to-forecast purchase model exposes us to the risk that our customers will not order those products for which we have forecast sales, or will purchase less than we have forecast. As a result, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components purchased by our manufacturers that they do not ultimately use. We work closely with our manufacturers and suppliers to manage material, quality, cost and delivery times, and we continually evaluate their services to ensure performance on a reliable and cost-effective basis.
We are currently using a direct order fulfillment model for the sale of our products. This model allows us to rely on our third-party contract manufacturers to perform final system integration and testing prior to shipment of products from their facilities directly to our customers. We believe that our sourcing and manufacturing strategy allows us to conserve capital, lower costs of product sales, adjust quickly to changes in market demand, and operate without dedicating significant resources to manufacturing-related plant and equipment.
As part of our effort to optimize our operations, we continue to focus on driving cost reductions through sourcing, rationalizing our supply chain, outsourcing or virtualizing certain activities, and consolidating distribution sites and service logistics partners. These efforts also include process optimization initiatives, such as vendor-managed inventory, and other operational models and strategies designed to drive improved efficiencies in our sourcing, production, logistics and fulfillment.
Backlog
Generally, we make sales pursuant to purchase orders placed by customers under framework agreements that govern the general commercial terms and conditions of the sale of our products and services. These agreements do not obligate customers to purchase any minimum or guaranteed order quantities. Moreover, we are periodically awarded business for new network opportunities or network upgrades following a selection process. In calculating backlog, we only include (i) customer purchase orders for products that have not been shipped and for services that have not yet been performed; and (ii) customer orders relating to products that have been delivered and services that have been performed, but are awaiting customer acceptance under the applicable contract terms. Generally, our customers may cancel or change their orders with limited advance notice, or they may decide not to accept our products and services, although both cancellation and non-acceptance are infrequent. Backlog may be fulfilled several quarters following receipt of a purchase order, or in the case of certain service obligations, may relate to multi-year support period. As a result, backlog should not necessarily be viewed as an accurate indicator of future revenue for any particular period.
Our backlog was $1.13 billion as of October 31, 2017 as compared to $1.15 billion as of October 31, 2016. Backlog includes product and service orders from commercial and government customers combined. Backlog at October 31, 2017 includes approximately $278.2 million primarily related to orders for products and maintenance and support services that are not expected to be filled or performed within fiscal 2018. Because backlog can be defined in different ways by different companies, our presentation of backlog may not be comparable with figures presented by other companies in our industry.
Seasonality
Like other companies in our industry, we experience quarterly fluctuations in customer activity due to seasonal considerations. We typically experience reductions in order volume toward the end of the calendar year, as the procurement cycles of some of our customers slow and network deployment activity by service providers is curtailed. This period coincides with the first quarter of our fiscal year. This seasonality in our order flows has often resulted in weaker revenue results in the first quarter of our fiscal year. These seasonal effects may not apply consistently in future periods and may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue or results of operations.
Competition 
Competition among communications network solution vendors remains intense on a global basis. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, frequent introduction of new networking solutions and aggressive selling efforts, including significant pricing pressure, to displace incumbent vendors and capture market share. 
13

Competition for sales of communications networking solutions is dominated by a small number of very large, multi-national companies. Our competitors include Huawei, Nokia, Cisco, Fujitsu, Juniper Networks, and ZTE. As compared to us, many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, operational and marketing resources, significantly broader product offerings, and more established relationships with service providers and other customer segments. Because of their scale and resources, they may be perceived to be a better fit for the procurement or network strategies of larger network operators. We also continue to compete with several smaller, but established, companies that offer one or more products that compete directly or indirectly with our offerings or whose products address specific niches within the markets and customer segments we address. These competitors include Infinera, ADVA, Coriant, and ECI. We also compete with a number of smaller companies that provide significant competition for a specific product, application, customer segment or geographic market. 
Because some of our competitors, both large and small, are not vertically integrated in their packet-optical supply chain, they rely upon coherent modem technology developed by and procured from third-party “merchant” providers, including Acacia Communications. We may compete with these providers as we pursue our strategy of capturing market share within these merchant modem sales opportunities. We have entered into global distribution relationships to sell our WaveLogic coherent optical technology into this market through Lumentum, NeoPhotonics and Oclaro. Each has the unrestricted ability to sell such optical modules to end users, including our customers, our competitors, and other vendors or network operators that plan to build or use “white box” hardware.  Accordingly, we may ultimately compete in the marketplace with these partners. 
The principal competitive factors applicable to our markets include: 

• | product functionality, speed, capacity, scalability and performance;


• | price, cost per bit and total cost of ownership of our solutions;


• | incumbency and strength of existing business relationships;


• | ability to offer comprehensive networking solutions, consisting of hardware, software and services;


• | product development that satisfies customers’ immediate and future network requirements;


• | flexibility and openness of platforms, including ease of integration, interoperability and integrated management;


• | ability to offer solutions that accommodate a range of different consumption models;


• | space and power considerations;


• | manufacturing and lead-time capability; and


• | services and support capabilities.

As a result of the intense and fragmented environment in which we compete, winning new opportunities can often require that we agree to unfavorable commercial terms or pricing, and certain other onerous contractual commitments. These terms can adversely affect our results of operations. These terms can also lengthen our revenue recognition or cash collection cycles, add start-up costs to initial sales or deployment of our solutions, require financial commitments or performance bonds, and place a disproportionate allocation of risk upon us.
We expect the competition in our industry to continue to broaden and to intensify as network operators pursue a diverse range of network strategies. As these changes occur, we expect that our business will overlap more directly with additional networking solution suppliers, including IP router vendors, data center switch providers and other suppliers or integrators of networking technology traditionally geared toward different network applications, layers or functions. In addition, as we seek increased customer adoption of our Blue Planet software platform, and network operator demands for software programmability, management and control increase, we expect to compete more directly with software vendors and information technology vendors or system integrators. We may also face competition from system and component vendors, including those in our supply chain, who develop networking products based on off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware technology, referred to as “white box” hardware, particularly where a customer’s network strategy seeks to emphasize deployment of such product offerings or to adopt a disaggregated approach to the procurement of hardware and software.  

Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property Rights
The success of our business and technology leadership is significantly dependent upon our proprietary and internally developed technology. We rely upon the intellectual property protections afforded by patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish, maintain and enforce rights in our proprietary technologies and product branding. We maintain an incentive program for inventions and patents that seeks to reward innovation and an internal invention review board that selects appropriate protection mechanisms for our technology. We regularly file applications for patents and have a significant number of patents in the United States and other countries where we do business. As of December 1, 2017, we had 1,624 issued U.S. patents, 241 pending U.S. patent applications, 393 issued non-U.S. patents, and 166 pending non-U.S. patent applications.
14

We also rely on non-disclosure agreements and other contracts and policies regarding confidentiality with employees, contractors and customers to establish proprietary rights and to protect trade secrets and confidential information. Our practice is to require employees and relevant consultants to execute non-disclosure and proprietary rights agreements upon commencement of their employment or consulting arrangements with us. These agreements acknowledge our ownership of intellectual property developed by the individual during the course of his or her work with us. The agreements also require that these persons maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary information disclosed to them.
Enforcing proprietary rights, especially patents, can be costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps that we are taking will detect or prevent all unauthorized use. The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We have been subject to several claims related to patent infringement, including by competitors and also by non-practicing patent assertion entities, and we have been requested to indemnify customers pursuant to contractual indemnity obligations relating to infringement claims made by third parties. Intellectual property infringement assertions could cause us to incur substantial costs, including settlement costs and legal fees in the defense of related actions. If we are not successful in defending these claims, our business could be adversely affected. For example, we may be required to enter into a license agreement requiring us to make ongoing royalty payments; we may be required to redesign our products; or we may be prohibited from selling infringing technology in certain jurisdictions.
Our operating system, element management and network virtualization, management, and orchestration software and other solutions incorporate software and components under licenses from third parties, including software subject to various open source software licenses. As network operators seek to adopt network infrastructures with increased software control and programmability and to utilize an open ecosystem of physical and virtual network resources provided by multiple third parties, we expect to incorporate into our solutions additional elements of open source software or license additional software or technology from third parties. We expect that these network architectural approaches will require increased openness and interoperability of multi-vendor, multi-domain network environments, requiring an increased degree of cooperation among solutions providers. Failure to obtain or maintain such licenses or other third-party intellectual property rights could affect our development efforts and market opportunities, or could require us to re-engineer our products or to obtain alternate technologies. Moreover, there is a risk that open source and other technology licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products.
Environmental Matters
Our business and operations are subject to environmental laws in various jurisdictions around the world, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) regulations adopted by the European Union. We are also subject to disclosure and related requirements that apply to the presence of “conflict minerals” in our products or supply chain. We seek to operate our business in compliance with such laws relating to the materials and content of our products and product takeback and recycling. Environmental regulation is increasing, particularly outside of the United States, and we expect that our domestic and international operations may be subject to additional environmental compliance requirements, which could expose us to additional costs. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to environmental regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Employees
As of October 31, 2017, we had a global workforce consisting of 5,737 employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider the relationships with our employees to be good. While we have been able to recruit and retain key personnel with the capabilities required by our business and markets, competition for highly skilled technical, engineering and other personnel with experience in our industry is intense. We believe that our future success depends in critical part on our continued ability to recruit, motivate and retain such qualified personnel.
