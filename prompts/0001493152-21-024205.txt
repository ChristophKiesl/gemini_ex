General Overview
 
We are a holding company incorporated in Delaware. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct a substantial majority of our operations through our operating entities established in the People’s Republic of China, or the PRC, primarily our variable interest entities (the “VIEs”). We do not have any equity ownership of our VIEs, instead we control and receive the economic benefits of our VIEs’ business operations through certain contractual arrangements. Our common stock that currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Markets are shares of our Delaware holding company that maintains service agreements with the associated operating companies. The Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our structure, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our securities could decline or become worthless. For a description of our corporate structure and contractual arrangements, see “Corporate Structure” on page 5 and “Contractual Arrangements with Ankang Longevity Group or Zhisheng Group and their Owners” on page 6.
 
We use our subsidiaries’ and VIEs’ vertically and horizontally integrated production, distribution, and sales channels to provide health and well-being focused plant-based products. Our products are only sold domestically in China. We utilize modern engineering technologies and biotechnologies to produce, among other products, Chinese herbal medicines, organic agricultural produce, and specialized textiles. Our health and well-being focused plant-based products business is divided into three major segments:
 
Processing and distributing traditional Chinese herbal medicine products as well as other pharmaceutical products. This segment is conducted through our VIE, Ankang Longevity Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (“Ankang Longevity Group”), which operates 66 cooperative retail pharmacies throughout Ankang, a city in southern Shaanxi province, China, through which we sell directly to individual customers traditional Chinese medicinal products produced by us as well as by third parties. Ankang Longevity Group also owns a factory specializing in decoction, which is the process by which solid materials are heated or boiled in order to extract liquids, and distributes decoction products to wholesalers and pharmaceutical companies around China.
 
On August 16, 2021, Tenet-Jove, completed the previously announced acquisition pursuant to the Restructuring Agreement dated June 8, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, (i) the Company transferred all of its rights and interests in Ankang Longevity to Yushe County Guangyuan Forest Development Co., Ltd. (“Guangyuan”)’s Shareholders in exchange for the control of 100% of equity interests in Guangyuan, which composes of one group of similar identifiable assets; (ii) Tenet-Jove entered a Termination Agreement with Ankang Longevity and the Ankang Shareholders; (iii) as a consideration to the Restructuring Agreement and based on a valuation report on the equity interests of Guangyuan issued by an independent third party, Tenet-Jove relinquished all of its rights and interests in Ankang Longevity and transferred those rights and interests to the Guangyuan Shareholders; and (iv) Guangyuan and the Guangyuan Shareholders entered into a series of variable interest entity agreements with Tenet-Jove. The assets and liabilities of the entities of Ankang Longevity Group have been reclassified as “assets of discontinued operations” and “liabilities of discontinued operations” within current and non-current assets and liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2021 and 2020. The results of operations of Ankang Longevity have been reclassified to “net income (loss) from discontinued operations” in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.
 
Processing and distributing green and organic agricultural products as well as growing and cultivating yew trees (taxus media) - We currently cultivate and sell yew mainly to group and corporate customers, but do not currently process yew into Chinese or Western medicines. This segment is conducted through our VIEs: Shineco Zhisheng (Beijing) Bio-Technology Co. (“Zhisheng Bio-Tech”), Yantai Zhisheng International Freight Forwarding Co., Ltd (“Zhisheng Freight”), Yantai Zhisheng International Trade Co., Ltd (“Zhisheng Trade”), and Qingdao Zhihesheng Agricultural Produce Services, Ltd (“Qingdao Zhihesheng”) (collectively, the “Zhisheng VIEs”).
 
Developing and distributing specialized fabrics, textiles, and other byproducts derived from an indigenous Chinese plant Apocynum Venetum, grown in the Xinjiang region of China, and known in Chinese as “Luobuma” or “bluish dogbane” - Our Luobuma products are specialized textile and health supplement products designed to incorporate traditional Eastern medicines with modern scientific methods. These products are predicated on centuries-old traditions of Eastern herbal remedies derived from the Luobuma raw material. This segment is channeled through our directly-owned subsidiary, Beijing Tenet-Jove Technological Development Co., Ltd. (“Tenet-Jove”), and its 90% subsidiary Tianjin Tenet Huatai Technological Development Co., Ltd. (“Tenet Huatai”).
 
We primarily market our health and wellbeing-focused products in China. At present, we do not sell any of our products in the United States or Canada. China’s domestic pharmaceutical and healthcare products market is fast-growing but, in our opinion, underdeveloped. We believe China’s healthcare sector has the capacity to develop even further. From pharmaceuticals to medical products to general consumer health, China remains among the world’s most attractive markets, and by far the fastest-growing of all the large emerging ones. Driving this growth is China’s aging population, increased incidence of chronic diseases, and a material increase in investment from both domestic and foreign corporations. The growth also reflects the Chinese government’s focus on healthcare as both a social priority (as witnessed in its late 2000s healthcare reforms) and a strategic priority (as evidenced in the 12th five-year plan’s stated focus on growing the biomedical industry in the future).

The details of each business segment are described as follows:
 
Ankang Longevity Group
 
The companies of this segment, Ankang Longevity Group, operates 66 cooperative retail pharmacies throughout Ankang, a city in southern Shaanxi province, China, through which we sell directly to individual customers traditional Chinese medicinal products produced by us as well as by third parties. Ankang Longevity Group also owns a factory specializing in decoction, which is the process by which solid materials are heated or boiled in order to extract liquids, and distributes decoction products to wholesalers and pharmaceutical companies around China.
 
On August 16, 2021, Tenet-Jove, completed the previously announced acquisition pursuant to the Restructuring Agreement dated June 8, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, (i) the Company transferred all of its rights and interests in Ankang Longevity to Yushe County Guangyuan Forest Development Co., Ltd. (“Guangyuan”)’s Shareholders in exchange for the control of 100% of equity interests in Guangyuan, which composes of one group of similar identifiable assets; (ii) Tenet-Jove entered a Termination Agreement with Ankang Longevity and the Ankang Shareholders; (iii) as a consideration to the Restructuring Agreement and based on a valuation report on the equity interests of Guangyuan issued by an independent third party, Tenet-Jove relinquished all of its rights and interests in Ankang Longevity and transferred those rights and interests to the Guangyuan Shareholders; and (iv) Guangyuan and the Guangyuan Shareholders entered into a series of variable interest entity agreements with Tenet-Jove. The assets and liabilities of the entities of Ankang Longevity Group have been reclassified as “assets of discontinued operations” and “liabilities of discontinued operations” within current and non-current assets and liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2021 and 2020. The results of operations of Ankang Longevity have been reclassified to “net income (loss) from discontinued operations” in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.


Zhisheng Group
 
The Company’s other VIEs, which form the Zhisheng Group and include Zhisheng Bio-Tech, Zhisheng Freight, Zhisheng Trade and Qingdao Zhihesheng, engage in the business of organic agricultural products, principally yew trees, as well as providing logistics services for all of the agricultural products we produce. Since 2013, this segment is focusing its efforts on the growing and cultivation of yew trees (taxus media), small evergreen trees that can be used for the production of anti-cancer medication as well as ornamental bonsai trees, which are known to have the effect of purifying indoor air quality. We currently cultivate and sell yew trees but do not currently process yew into Chinese or Western medicines. The entities composing the Zhisheng Group are currently focusing on researching, developing and cultivating organic produce, yew ecological products and other native plants. The operations of this segment are focused in the East region of Mainland China, principally Shandong Province, and in Beijing where we have newly developed over 100 acres of modern greenhouses for cultivating yew and other plants. This segment accounts for approximately 96% of our revenues. 
 
Tenet-Jove
 
Through Tenet-Jove and Tianjin Tenet Huatai, the Company develops and distributes specialized textiles and health supplements derived from a native Chinese plant Apocynum venetum, grown in the Xinjiang region of China and known in Chinese as “Luobuma” or “bluish dogbane” and referred to herein as Luobuma. This plant has traditionally been used in China both internally and externally for centuries to treat high blood pressure, depression, dizziness, pain, insomnia, and other common ailments. The stems of Luobuma serve as raw material for fiber used in textile production, and the leaves serve as raw material for pharmaceutical drugs. This segment accounts for approximately 4% of our revenues. 
 
The companies of this segment, Tenet-Jove and Tianjin Tenet Huatai, specialize in Luobuma sourcing and developing Luobuma byproducts. With rich experience and broad channels in the Chinese domestic market, we believe that we are one of the leaders in Luobuma textile sales in China. This segment’s operations are focused in the north region of Mainland China, mostly carried out in Xinjiang and Tianjin. Our Luobuma products are specialized textile and health supplement products designed to incorporate traditional Eastern medicines with modern scientific methods. These products are predicated on centuries-old traditions of Eastern herbal remedies derived from the Luobuma raw material.
 
In addition to developing textile products, we expect to use our high-pressure steam degumming process to extract other Luobuma byproducts we intend to commercialize and distribute: flavonoids, xylooligosaccharides (XOS), edible pectin, fiberboard, and organic fertilizer. The traditional method of degumming Luobuma only produces Luobuma fiber, whereas our high-pressure steam degumming process produces these five additional Luobuma byproducts. Flavonoids are organic compounds widely distributed in plants, and flavonoid-rich Luobuma extract can be used in the manufacture of many pharmaceuticals. Xylooligosaccharides, or XOS, is a sugar that can be used as a food additive that provides various health benefits like lowering glucose levels. Pectin is a thickener and stabilizer used in food, beverages and cosmetics, as well as a gelling agent for jellies. Fiberboard is a type of engineered wood alternative that is made out of Luobuma fibers; it is used widely for furniture manufacturing and packaging.

Product Descriptions
 
Traditional Chinese Medicines
 
Our Ankang Longevity Group manufactures hundreds of Chinese medicinal herbal products and decoction pieces such as medicines for bone and joint pain, arthritis, respiratory infections, insomnia, as well as many other common ailments. We distribute such products through an established Chinese domestic sales and distribution network, including through more than 20 pharmaceutical wholesale companies and more than 50 hospitals throughout China, as well as through our own and cooperative retail pharmacies. In addition to distributing Chinese medicinal herbal products, we also distribute many popular Western medicines we purchase from outside parties through our wholesale and retail channels so that we can offer a good variety of products to meet customer demands. In the second quarter of 2013, this group entered the pharmaceutical retailing industry through a joint venture with another large domestic pharmacy chain group, Shaanxi Pharmaceutical Group. Ankang’s main products include the following traditional Chinese medicines:

● | Polygonum cuspidatum or Japanese knotweed, which is ingested to treat colds, digestive diseases, hepatitis and Cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation); 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Salvia mint, which is ingested to improve microcirculation; 
● | Tianma, which is ingested to treat Rheumatoid arthritis; 
● | Eucommia, which is ingested for bone and join pain; 
● | Radix, which is ingested to treat respiratory infections; 
● | Schisandra shrub, which is ingested to treat insomnia; and 
● | Berberis shrub, which is used as a raw material for antibiotics. 

Yew Trees
 
Currently, through our Zhisheng Group VIEs, we sell ornamental yew trees and yew cuttings to third parties. We also rent ornamental yew trees to companies who desire the environmental benefits of natural plants in their workplaces. Until recently we were primarily engaged in the production, distribution and sale of agricultural products, including the planting and processing of organic fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, eggplants, string beans, peppers as well as certain popular fruits in China like blueberries and wine grapes, but those operations have been temporarily scaled back due to stiff competition and a change of our internal policy in favor of the expansion of our yew tree business.
 
As our inventories of young yew trees mature, our long-term goals are particularly focused on the extraction of paclitaxel or taxol, which is derived from certain species of yew trees including those we grow. Taxol, a broad-spectrum mitotic inhibitor used in cancer chemotherapy, can be extracted from mature yew trees. As a mitotic inhibitor, taxol adheres to rapidly dividing cancerous cells during mitosis (cell division) and interferes with the division process. It may suppress tumor growth through regulating microtubule stabilization, inducing apoptosis and adjusting immunologic mechanism. Taxol is also used for the prevention of restenosis, which is the narrowing of blood vessels. In the treatment of certain soft tissue cancers, such as breast cancer, taxol is given for early stage and metastatic breast cancer after combination anthracycline and cytoxan therapy and is also given as treatment to shrink a tumor before surgery. It can also be used together with a drug called Cisplatin to treat advanced ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, or “NSCLC.” The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved taxol as the primary and secondary treatment for NSCLC. There are other generally accepted protocols for the use of taxol as a cancer drug alone or in combination with other drugs depending upon the diagnosis, staging and type of cancer, as well as a patient’s medical history, tolerances and allergies, among other relevant factors. Taxol is usually sold to large pharmaceutical companies to be used in their products, which can be used to treat patients with lung, ovarian, breast, head and neck cancer, and advanced forms of Kaposi’s sarcoma.

Tenet-Jove Textiles
 
Our company’s scientists and other Chinese researchers have brought modern scientific methods to the study of Luobuma, and have determined that Luobuma fibers have an increased tendency to radiate light at the “far infrared” end of the light spectrum, with wavelengths measuring between 8-15 microns (referred to as “FIR”). Based on Chinese scientific studies some believe that Luobuma’s FIR-radiating qualities exert a positive effect on various functions of the human body, including cellular metabolism. For this reason, we have marketed and sold these products utilizing such technology. These products are popular with Chinese customers seeking the perceived benefits of traditional Chinese medicine.
 
For example, according to a report by the College of Science of Tianjin University, tests conducted by the PRC’s National Institute of Metrology have reported that the radiance rate of far infrared light from Luobuma fiber is 84%, 2 to 4 times higher than that from cotton and other natural fibers. The same tests found that the FIR radiance rate from our proprietary bio-ceramic powder reaches 91%. Healthful benefits have been observed at radiance rate levels above 70%. Based on these observations about FIR radiance, we have developed textiles that our customers can wear and from which we believe they can receive those health benefits commonly associated with Chinese herbal remedies.
 
Tenet-Jove first commercially developed the natural FIR-radiant properties of the Luobuma plant in 1997. We refer to this natural Luobuma fiber as a “Second Generation” FIR textile. The “First Generation” of FIR-radiant textiles initially became popular in China around 1989, when manufacturers learned to add 3% of a FIR-radiant inorganic material to synthetic fibers comparable to nylon or polyester. This “First Generation” FIR material employs a relatively low level of technology and has relatively few perceived or measurable health benefits. The “Second Generation” FIR textiles we have developed are softer, smoother and more breathable natural fibers that are not as prone to static electricity as the low technology “First Generation” FIR-radiant textiles.
 
Our Luobuma fabrics have been a success in the Chinese domestic market and have also received numerous awards. The technology applied to our Luobuma-based FIR Therapeutic Clothing and Textile Products has received a “Special Golden Award” from the China National Intellectual Property Bureau at China’s National Patent and Brand Expo. Our products under the brand name of “Tenethealth” have also been honored with the title of “Consumer’s Favorite Products” by the Chinese Consumer Association.
 
The fibers of natural Luobuma FIR materials can contain up to 32 medicinal compounds, many of which are familiar to practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine. In addition, our processes for manufacturing Luobuma textiles produce a fabric that is smooth, air-permeable, and soft. By combining a product that is familiar to PRC consumers seeking the benefits of traditional Chinese medicine with quality and comfort, we believe we are innovative and have chosen a product that has great commercial potential in the Chinese textile market.
 
Tenet-Jove Product Development
 
We have developed what we term a “Third Generation” of FIR textiles under a contract with the Institute of Process Engineering at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, one of the leading scientific institutions in China. Our research and development has focused on adding nanotechnology enhancements to our Luobuma textile products, in which we use small-scale nanotechnology to embed or impregnate our Luobuma-fiber textiles with other FIR-radiant materials, bio-ceramic materials, or other Chinese herbal remedies. Using these nanotechnology methods, we have developed and marketed health-promoting textile goods that are impregnated with FIR-radiant materials or other Chinese herbal remedies, which are then absorbed through the wearer’s skin. We believe these “Third Generation” FIR textiles will better combine the health benefits of Luobuma with an even softer, more natural cotton-like fabric that will be popular with Chinese consumers.
 
The Company presently produces approximately 100 “Third Generation” FIR textile products. These textile products include:
 

● | Far Infrared bedding sets (including various pillows, comforters, and sheets); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Far Infrared underwear, T-shirts, and socks; 
● | Far Infrared knee and shin pads, waist supports and other protective clothing; and 
● | Far Infrared body wraps or protectors (for the ankle, elbow, wrist, and knee). 

 
All our textile products are made of Luobuma-based fibers and are impregnated with bio-ceramic powder, which contains various minerals such as halloysite. Both the fiber and the bio-ceramic powder are developed with the Company’s patented, proprietary techniques.

Manufacturing and Production Facilities
 
We have formed strategic alliances with several certified knitting and clothing manufacturers throughout China in order to produce our Luobuma products. We assign them limited manufacturing jobs and require certain conditions, including protecting our proprietary techniques and meeting our rigid quality standards. We are in preliminary negotiations to build a new facility in Kuerle, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China to exploit our steam explosion Luobuma fiber production technology.
 
In 2013, we began large-scale operations in newly leased, energy efficient greenhouses aggregating 50,000 square meters in Beijing and have temporarily scaled back our operations in our former greenhouses located in Shandong Province. At this time, we rent our greenhouses in Shandong Province to local farmers. Our current greenhouse facilities are used primarily for the cultivation of yew trees and other decorative plants and trees. These state-of-the-art facilities allow us to better regulate light, temperate, humidity and other conditions within the greenhouse as well as to significantly increase the number of plants that can be housed in a particular greenhouse footprint. To a lesser degree, we expect these current greenhouses will reduce our manual labor costs associated with our greenhouse operations by approximately 25%. Rather than competing on price, which has become increasingly difficult in the Chinese market, we expect that technological and productivity advances from our new greenhouses will improve our competitive position within our agricultural segment, but there can be no guarantee that we will experience such advances, or if we do, that such advances would improve our competitive position.
 
Ankang Longevity Group has an approximately 4,000 square meter production factory and an approximately 2,000 square meter production facility in Ankang City, Shaanxi Province, China, which are used for production of decoction pieces. 
 
Our Strategy for Research and Development
 

● | To keep our products proprietary and patented; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | To focus on our core existing product lines: Chinese herbal medicines and pharmaceutical sales, yew cultivation, Luobuma-based products, and FIR technology; 
● | To commit to further development of our Luobuma byproducts, houpu magnolia products, and selenium-enriched herbs and plants; and 
● | To build strategic alliances with universities and scientific institutions, which will allow us exposure to advanced technologies, excellent researchers and scientists and we believe will lower the costs and timing of the development of new products. 

 
Tenet-Jove specializes in developing Luobuma products and combining FIR technology with natural herbal medicines. We estimate that there are large supplies of Luobuma in China, especially Xinjiang Province. In China, Luobuma can grow as high as 3.6 meters. In the first year after planting, Luobuma can be harvested once during that year; thereafter, it can be harvested twice per year before or at the beginning of the flowering period in June and a second time around September. Currently, we believe China’s Luobuma supplies are largely undeveloped. The Company’s future success will depend on improving its techniques to industrialize Luobuma by developing new Luobuma-derived products such as improved Luobuma functional fiber and various Luobuma nutritional supplements, which can be marketed and distributed through the Company’s Ankang Longevity business segment.
 
High-Pressure Steam Degumming Process
 
We currently produce an extensive line of Luobuma-based textile products; we have an exclusive patent on a Luobuma fiber yarn spinning method. Large-scale production of Luobuma fiber products is generally difficult due to the limited yield of Luobuma fiber and the high cost of obtaining that fiber. The current mainstream technology used to produce Luobuma fiber mainly uses chemical agents to remove gum from Luobuma, which destroys Luobuma fiber and causes lower Luobuma fiber production and pollution and makes it very difficult to extract other valuable by-products. A central technical challenge is how to quickly and efficiently remove the gum and sap from the Luobuma plants so that only the natural fiber remains.

10
--

 

To solve this technical challenge, in August 2006 we signed a technology development contract with the Institute of Process Engineering at the Chinese Academy of Science (the “Institute of Process Engineering”), one of China’s leading scientific institutes. Pursuant to our contract, we and the Institute of Process Engineering worked together to develop a high-pressure steam degumming process for the mass production of Luobuma fiber, as well as its byproducts, which was completed in 2008. A literal translation of the project name is “The Stream Steam Explosion Project.” Essentially, the project will develop a modern material engineering method of quickly blasting a large amount of high-pressure steam into a large container filled with raw Luobuma plants. The steam will remove the gum and sap and leave the fiber for use in textile production. The gum and sap and other Luobuma byproducts will be washed out with the steam and collected in a separate place for other uses.
 
If we can successfully implement our high-pressure steam degumming process, we expect that our annual yield of Luobuma fiber can rise by over one hundredfold— from less than 200 tons to approximately 27,000 tons per year, and the cost of extracting the fiber will be reduced by approximately 50%. For example, the older method of production might require 150 laborers to produce one ton of Luobuma fiber in one day, whereas our high-pressure steam degumming process can utilize just 30 laborers to produce 15 tons of Luobuma fiber in one day. During the process, a certain amount of steam will be used, but unlike the traditional method of degumming, our high-pressure steam degumming process discharges no hazardous byproducts of any kind, because the fiber will be collected in one place, and the liquefied gum and sap and other material will be collected in another place to further separate flavonoids, xylooligosaccharides (XOS), and edible pectin through biological reverse osmosis membrane. The remaining material could be used to produce fiberboard and organic fertilizer, leaving no hazardous discharge or waste. We expect that this technique will be relatively simple and convenient for us to operate with our advanced technology. Luobuma fiber produced by this technique is more like cotton and more spinnable than before.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Trademarks
 
We regard our trademarks as an important part of our business due to the name recognition of our customers. Our subsidiary, Tenet-Jove, has currently obtained 18 trademark registrations at the China Trademark Office and applying for another 7 trademarks covering various categories of the company’s products. As of June 30, 2021, we are not aware of any valid claim or challenges to our right to use our registered trademark or any counterfeit or other infringement to our registered trademark.
Patents
 
Currently, the Company holds a patent in the People’s Republic of China for Luobuma fiber yarn preparation and an application method (patent number: 201110429362.9), which serves as our core technology and its derivative applications for our Luobuma business.
Distribution Network
 
We sell our products through various distribution networks. Our traditional Chinese medicinal products and Western medicines are largely sold through either our wholesale customers or our Ankang retail pharmacies — 13 pharmacies operating as Sunsimiao Pharmacies and 66 pharmacies operated by third parties as Ankang Longevity Group Pharmacy cooperatives. Additionally, we sell decoction pieces on the Anhui Bozhou Chinese medicine transaction market, to medical materials company, such as Qianhe Pharmaceutical Industry Co. and to Chinese patent medicine factories, such as Wanxi Pharmaceutical Factory.
 
Our Luobuma product distribution networks consist of four distributors who distribute our products to approximately 21 outlets, including flagship stores, retail stores and sales counters. These distributors sell our products throughout mainland China, under our proprietary brand name and “Tenethealth®” trademark . We also sell our Luobuma textile products online through third party e-commerce websites, such as Taobao, Tmall and JD. Our yew trees and agricultural products are primarily sold through our sales personnel and group and institutional sales. In 2013, the Company placed its Luobuma, traditional Chinese medicine and yew products in a total of 144 retail stores and sales counters throughout China and on four e-commerce websites. 
 
Our sales and distribution strategy for our products focuses on expanding our distribution network of retail stores and sales counters into all major provinces and cities of China. We also plan to use our current distribution network to introduce our newly developed products into target markets more efficiently and effectively.
 
All of these certified outlets operate independently, but they prominently display products mainly carrying our trade name “Tenethealth®”. These independent retailers sell our products as well as other products.

Sales and Marketing
 
We market Luobuma to consumers primarily by highlighting its unique characteristics— the material is soft like cotton, breathable like hemp and is smooth to the touch like silk, and its FIR-radiating qualities are believed by some to exert a positive effect on various functions of the human body. Very few other companies in China are involved with Luobuma fiber production, so we are chiefly able to market our products against products of natural and man-made fibers that do not have the perceived advantages of Luobuma. The small number of companies that are involved in Luobuma fiber production are still using the traditional, outdated methods of producing Luobuma. We are the only company using advanced technologies. Tenet-Jove’s overall marketing strategy includes:

● | Brand marketing strategy, primarily through media publicity, product- and market-oriented strategy; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Distinguishing Luobuma as a high-end, technologically advanced native Chinese product; and 
● | Online advertising, which includes online advertisements appearing on the sites where we sell our products, as well as social media advertising, including Wechat, and direct e-mail solicitations. 

 
Ankang Longevity Group’s overall marketing strategy of its traditional Chinese medicine products focuses on promoting the Ankang district’s place in traditional Chinese medicine history and its geographic location. First, Ankang City is located in the Han River area between Qinling Mountain and Ba Mountain. Because of its geographic location and favorable climate, it is the principal production location of the ancient Qin medicine, which dates from the Qin dynasty, the first imperial dynasty of China. This area contains more than 1,200 types of herbs and plants used in traditional Chinese medicine and is home to 176 of the 282 types of herbal medicine set forth in The Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China (PPRC), compiled by the Pharmacopoeia Commission of the Ministry of Health of the PRC. The PPRC is the PRC’s official compendium of drugs, covering traditional Chinese and western medicines. Second, the soil in Ankang City, especially in Ziyang County, which is located in Ziyang District of Ankang City, contains large quantities of selenium. Because the selenium content of food is largely dependent on location and soil conditions, which can vary widely, the tea, traditional Chinese medicines and raw materials produced and cultivated in Ankang contain great amounts of selenium, which is a beneficial nutrient in foods and an important raw material for medicines. Ankang Longevity Group has entered into an agreement with the local government in Ziyang County for the use of an approximately 8,200 acre selenium-rich parcel of farmland and woodlands for the cultivation of herbs and plants — principally houpu magnolia and eucommia — used in traditional Chinese medicine. Selenium has also attracted attention because of its antioxidant properties; antioxidants protect cells from damage.

Ankang Longevity emphasizes the following marketing strategies :
 

● | A focus on the excellent quality of its selenium Chinese herbal medicines; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Establishment of a long-term supply relationships with pharmaceutical companies and hospitals nationwide; and 
● | Developing its Chinese herbal medicine wholesale market and e-commerce platform. 

 
Finally, the Zhisheng Group emphasizes the following marketing strategies :
 

● | Focusing on the advanced growing conditions provided by our modern greenhouse operations and the potential pharmaceutical byproducts of yew, especially paclitaxel or taxol; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Brand marketing to focus on our yew’s brand positioning. 

 
In October 2012, the Company, through its VIEs, Zhisheng Freight and Zhisheng Agricultural, entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party, Zhejiang Zhen’Ai Network Warehousing Services Co., Ltd. (“Zhen’Ai Network”), to invest RMB 14.5 million (approximately $2.4 million) into the Tiancang Systematic Warehousing Project (“Tiancang Project”) operated by Zhen’Ai Network in exchange for a 29% equity interest in this project upon completion. The Tiancang Project is an online platform aiming to provide comprehensive warehousing and logistic solutions for various companies’ e-commerce needs. The Company expects to increase its distribution channels through this platform as well as to benefit from boosting its own revenue by providing synergetic logistic and warehousing services using its existing facilities and a service team in the Eastern port city of Qingdao.
 
Currently, the Company’s sales are generated through the following five major channels:
 

1. | Retail stores and sales counters. We mainly sell our Luobuma related products through sales counters and medicine through our pharmacy chain stores. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Sales to group or institutional customers. We mainly sell our organic agricultural products and yew trees to group or corporate customers. 
3. | Seminars and conferences. Because a majority of new consumers need to learn about our new products before buying them, it becomes very important and effective for us to organize or sponsor seminars and events to present healthcare knowledge while introducing and selling our products to new users. 
4. | Wholesale. We mainly sell our decocting-free Chinese herbal medicines to large Chinese medicine resellers and pharmaceutical companies. 
5. | E-commerce. We mainly sell the Luobuma related products through Tmall and Taobao to underdeveloped regions in China, Taiwan and Macau. We are currently one of only three certified online sellers of Luobuma textile products on China’s largest online sales platform, Tmall run by Alibaba. Selling through the Internet has become increasingly important to our sales in undeveloped regions and developed cities. 

The Market
 
We primarily market our health and wellbeing-focused products in China. At present, we do not sell any of our products in the United States or Canada. On the demand side, we believe that the following four forces drive market growth in all three of our business segments:

1. | The rapid growth of China’s economy, which has produced one of the largest groups of middle-class families in the world, with the largest collective purchasing power in the world. The Brookings Institution estimates that by 2030, over 70 percent of China’s population could be middle class, consuming approximately $10 trillion in goods and services. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The increase of China’s aging population. The China Census Bureau predicts that the majority of the China “baby boom” population (representing 40% of China’s total population) will be 66 or older by 2021, which represents over 500 million potential consumers of our pharmaceutical and healthcare products, the majority of which are sold to older customers. 
3. | Chinese people’s increasing attention and awareness to healthy and active lifestyles, especially in urban areas. 
4. | Chinese healthcare reforms.

We believe China’s healthcare sector has the capacity to grow in the coming years. From pharmaceuticals to medical products to general consumer health, China remains among the world’s most attractive markets, and by far the fastest-growing of all the large emerging ones. This growth is being driven by China’s aging population, increased incidence of chronic diseases, and a material increase in investment from both domestic and foreign corporations.
 
China’s healthcare market is being shaped by positive economic and demographic trends, further healthcare reform efforts, and the policies set forth in the government’s 12th five-year plan. We believe that improvements in infrastructure, the broadening of insurance coverage, and government encouragement and support for innovation will have positive implications for us and other healthcare companies.
 
Strong growth in the Chinese healthcare sector has been fueled by favorable demographic trends, continued urbanization throughout China, the overall Chinese economy’s expansion, and income growth (which encourages a greater awareness of and access to healthcare among Chinese consumers). It also reflects the Chinese government’s focus on healthcare as both a social priority (as witnessed in its late 2000s healthcare reforms) and a strategic priority (as witnessed in the 12th five-year plan’s stated focus on growing the Chinese biomedical industry). From pharmaceuticals to medical devices to traditional Chinese medicine, almost every health sector has benefited.
 
Competition
 
We compete with other top-tier pharmaceutical and healthcare companies in China. Many of them are more established than we are and have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we presently possess. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and a larger customer base. Those competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities and customer requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to customers, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some of our competitors have also developed similar products that compete with ours.
 
Our most prominent competitors in China’s textile products market are primarily large-scale textile companies, such as Luolai Home Textile Co., Fuanna Bedding and Furnishing Co., Ltd., Violet Home Textile Co., and Shuixing Home Textile Co., Ltd, as well as Bauerfeind Sports and Albert Medical, makers of protective clothing products similar to our protective clothing products. Our most prominent competitors in our pharmaceutical sales market include Ankang City Zhenning Chinese Medicine Decoction Pieces Co. Ltd. and Zhenping County Chinese Medicine Decoction Pieces Co. Ltd. Our most prominent competitors in China’s agricultural market are Beijing Jinfu Yinong Agricultural Technology Group Co., Ltd. for vegetables and other produce and Shenyang Xincheng Garden Engineering Co., Ltd. for yew trees. In the pharmaceutical sales market, we believe that our competitive position is strong because Shaanxi Pharmacy Holding in which Ankang Longevity Group has a 49% ownership stake, is a participant in the Ankang municipal government’s “Three Unities of Medicine” program, which is designed to facilitate the purchase, sale and delivery of pharmaceuticals. The “Three Unities of Medicine” program refers to “unified procurement price, unified selling price, and unified logistics”. This project is promoted by the Shaanxi Government to regulate the price of medicines in the local market. Under the program, the Shaanxi Pharmacy Holding joint venture directly sells medicines to local institutional purchasers, like hospitals; these institutional purchasers are only permitted to purchase pharmaceuticals from selected preferred providers. After a bidding process, Shaanxi Pharmacy Holding, along with other two companies, were selected by the Ankang municipal government as preferred providers under the program. However, Shaanxi Pharmacy Holding is entitled to cover all counties and districts of Ankang City, and the other two providers only cover portions of Ankang City. This program is valid until 2020, and the participants are subject to an ongoing review of their qualifications by the local pharmaceutical supervision authority every three years until 2020.

Ankang Longevity Group
 
Ankang Longevity Group competes within its traditional Chinese medicinal products and Western medicine wholesale and retail business primarily against Ankang City Zhenning Chinese Medicine Decoction Pieces Co. Ltd. and Zhenping County Chinese Medicine Decoction Pieces Co. Ltd., which conduct their wholesale pharmaceuticals business in the Ankang area, but Ankang Longevity Group has greater revenues than any of its competitors; its two main competitors’ output value and sales combined are just one-third of Ankang Longevity Group’s. The Ankang Longevity Group has formed a new pharmaceutical company and chain of drug stores with two entities wholly owned by the state-owned Shaanxi Pharmaceutical Group that has resulted in a favorable market position in the Ankang area.
 
Numerous competitors nationwide, including Ankang City Zhenning Chinese Medicine Decoction Pieces Co. Ltd. and Zhenping County Chinese Medicine Decoction Pieces Co. Ltd., participate in the sale of Chinese medicinal herbs and Chinese medicine decoction pieces; among them are some high-profile and large-scale companies along with some companies that have huge production and storage capacity to influence the market price. Because we believe we are able to obtain early access to and to occupy natural resources for producing selenium Chinese herbal medicines, the Group is especially focusing on those products in order to gain market share.
 
Zhisheng Group
 
There are dozens of companies planting and cultivating yew trees in China, some of which are large-scale companies. Shenyang Xincheng Garden Engineering Co., Ltd. is a large agricultural competitor whose main product is yew. Their nurseries have the most mature yew trees in northeast China, and the average age of their yew trees is more than eleven years old. Another competitor, Chongqing Jiangjin District Mansheng Agricultural Development Co., Ltd., has the biggest nursery for young plants in Southwest China. And Jingyin City Hengtu Town Green Industry Yew Base specializes in cultivating, planting, gardening, and technological development of yew trees. They were the first company to introduce taxus media yew trees in China.
 
Tenet-Jove
 
There are few viable competitors producing advanced technology textile products with health benefits like our Luobuma textile products. Principally, our competitors are those that market and sell traditional textile products, such as Luolai Home Textile Co., Fuanna Bedding and Furnishing Co., Ltd., Violet Home Textile Co., and Shuixing Home Textile Co., Ltd, as well as those companies that market and sell protective clothing, like Bauerfeind Sports and Albert Medical. Luobuma is native to China, thus our ability to source raw materials locally greatly enhances our competitive position in the Chinese market for high quality textile products with perceived health benefits.

Our employees are not represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages.
 
The Company plans to hire additional employees as required. Its management and employees enjoy both compensation and welfare benefits pursuant to Chinese laws. We are required under PRC law to make contributions to employee benefit plans at specified percentages of our after-tax profit. In addition, we are required by PRC law to cover employees in China with various types of social insurance. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we contributed approximately $86,418, $108,524 and $$128,713, respectively, to employee social insurance. The effect on our liquidity by the payments for these contributions is immaterial. We believe that we are in material compliance with the relevant PRC employment laws.
