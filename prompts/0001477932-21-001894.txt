The market individual micro-business owners represents a potential of 330 million users by the year of 2023. (Source: iResrarch. http://xueqiu.com/8455183447/172404679?sharetime=2,2/22/2021). YCloud serves corporate users in multiple industries, including Yuetao Group, Zhiding, Lvyue, Yuebei, Yuedian, Coke GO, and Zhongyanshangyue. We conduct business operations in mainland China and have established trial operations in Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Singapore.

Additionally, we have formed long-term technical collaborations with Yuetao App, Daren App, Yuebei App, Zhiding App, Yuedian App, and Lvyue App through Weijiafu. 
 
In January 2020, we appointed a third party software company to develop an auto-billing management system (“WeTrade System”), the early stage of the YCloud system, at the cost of RMB 400,000 (or approximately USD $62,000) to provide online payment services for micro-business owners in the PRC. The main functions of the YCloud system is to manage users’ marketing relationships, CPS commission profit management, multi-channel data statistics, AI fission and management, and improved supply chain systems.
 
Currently, YCloud serves the micro business industry. We expect to expand the application of YCloud to tourism, hospitality, livestreaming and short video, medical beauty and traditional retail industries.
 
Our Products and Technology
 
We have utilized digitalization, electronic management, electronic data exchange, big data analysis, AI fission technology, revenue management and other technologies to form a strong coordination effect. We believe that our cloud technology enables us to develop a platform with better functionality for micro-business users in China.

YCloud has four main functions and competitive advantages as follows:
 
Multiple integrated payment methods and payment analytics: the YCloud system provides micro-business owners with multiple payment methods such as Alipay, WeChat, and UnionPay. The total order amount is directly entered into the platform to collect funds in separate accounts. Using YCloud’s technology support, the micro-business owners offer multiple channels of payments to their customers, including Alipay, WeChat, and UnionPay. Meanwhile, YCloud assigns a bar code to merchandises that purchasers can then scan to pay,  allowing purchasers to make payments both online and offline. This proprietary payment technology allows our customers to reduce labor costs and error rates, thus significantly improving data analysis.
 
During the year 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, many companies, including businesses traditionally operating offline, from a wide range of industries, such as tourism, catering, entertainment or retail, have opted for micro-business model to build sales channels through online social platforms and expand business opportunities. As a result of th COVID-19 outbreak, consumer demand shifted, which forced business owners to expand to new markets and on multiple social platforms.

Competitive Business Conditions
 
The global E-commerce SaaS industry is still uprising, and is in its early stage of development. We may compete against businesses in varied sectors, many of which are larger than we are and have a dominant and secure position in other industries, or offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants, which we do not provide. However, most of our competitors only have individual areas of overlap with one of our core areas, including E-commerce SaaS, Store SaaS, Cloud Service, Integrated Payment Service, and Advertising Service, but none compete at all levels.
 
Our primary competitor is China Youzan Limited, which offers online and offline merchants suites of comprehensive solutions comprising third-party payments and various SaaS products and comprehensive service through its e-commerce platform, like marketing and customer engagement tools facilitate the process of transactions between merchants and their customers. We seek to differentiate ourself from industry participants by focusing on micro-business industry, the simplicity provided for digital transactions, and being recognized by our brand and technology.

Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business
 
Exchange Act Reporting Requirements
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act, and the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K. However, as a “smaller reporting company,” we are permitted to omit certain disclosures or provide less disclosure regarding certain information required to be disclosed under Regulation S-K as compared to companies that are not a “smaller reporting company.” 
 
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to shareholders of the Company at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require the Company to provide the Company’s shareholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least ten days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to the Company’s shareholders.

The costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to shareholders will cause our expenses to be significantly higher than they would be if we were a privately-held company.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 
We are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthen auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; management assessment of our internal controls; auditor attestation to management’s conclusions about internal controls (this is not applicable to “non-accelerated filers” and “smaller reporting companies”); prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will substantially increase our legal and accounting costs.
 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
We are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in mainland China. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a disadvantage. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties.
State and Local Regulations
 
There’s no state or local regulations that require us to obtain a special business license for our business, however the State of Florida requires us to file an Annual Report. We are not required as a company to maintain Worker’s Compensation Insurance and pay into the Florida Unemployment Compensation Fund since we have no employees. When we retain new officers and begin to pay salaries we will then have to apply for Workers Compensation Insurance and pay into the Florida Unemployment Compensation Fund.
