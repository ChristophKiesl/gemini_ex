Item 1. Business
Description of Business
 We are a leading global supplier of custom engineered solutions with sales, engineering and manufacturing locations in North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. We design, engineer and produce mechatronic products for Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) utilizing our broad range of technologies for user interface, light-emitting diode (“LED”) lighting system, power distribution and sensor applications. 
 Our solutions are found in the end markets of transportation (including automotive, commercial vehicle, e-bike, aerospace, bus and rail), cloud computing infrastructure, construction equipment, consumer appliance and medical devices. Our business is managed on a segment basis, with those segments being Automotive, Industrial, Interface and Medical. 
 Fiscal Year
 We maintain our financial records on the basis of a 52 or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to April 30. Fiscal 2021 ended on May 1, 2021 and fiscal 2019 ended on April 27, 2019, which represented 52 weeks of results for each year. Fiscal 2020 ended on May 2, 2020, which represented 53 weeks of results.
 Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
 The COVID-19 global pandemic has negatively affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruptions to capital and credit markets in the global financial markets. We began to see the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 at our China manufacturing facilities, which were initially closed after the Chinese New Year. Our manufacturing facilities in China resumed operations later in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, but at lower capacity utilization. However, the major impact to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic began in mid-March 2020, as our operations in North America and Europe were adversely impacted by many of our customers suspending their manufacturing operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our operations in North America and Europe gradually resumed operations, however production levels were still significantly reduced, resulting in lower capacity utilization, thus impacting our results of operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, production levels in North America and Europe returned to pre-COVID levels as a result of increased demand from customers and continued for the remainder of fiscal 2021. However, towards the end of our third quarter of fiscal 2021, many automotive companies announced a slowdown in their production schedules due to a worldwide semiconductor supply shortage. The semiconductor supply shortage is impacting our supply chain and our ability to meet demand at some of our customers as well. We expect this semiconductor shortage will impact our operating results and financial condition in fiscal 2022.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and business disruption, in March 2020, we implemented certain measures to manage costs, preserve liquidity and enhance employee safety. These measures included the following: 
  
• | reduction of payroll costs through a combination of temporary salary reductions, four-day work weeks and furloughs. In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we ceased the salary reductions and resumed five-day work weeks;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | elimination of most business travel and restriction of visitors to our facilities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhanced cleaning and disinfection procedures at our facilities, temperature checks for our workers before they enter our manufacturing facilities, the requirement to wear masks, promotion of social distancing at our facilities and requirements for employees to work from home where possible;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | deferral of discretionary spending; and
--+----------------------------------------


• | the March 2020 draw-down of $100.0 million under our revolving credit facility, which was repaid in full in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The initial draw-down was as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In fiscal 2021, we continued to focus on effectively managing the unprecedented challenges and uncertainties of the pandemic on a global basis. As our operations resumed, management prioritized the health and safety of our employees and their families. We adopted numerous safety procedures at our 34 global facilities, including hygiene and disinfection protocols, testing and contact tracing, social distancing and wearing personal protective equipment (“PPE”). We implemented the sharing of best practices throughout our global facilities, resulting in effective and standardized safety guidelines and procedures, updated on a regular basis, promoting the health and safety of our employees.

Management evaluated and redesigned our staffing requirements and structures to reflect the ongoing impact of the pandemic on our business and operations. Among other actions, management successfully implemented several important business consolidations and successfully managed pandemic-related labor issues at our facilities in Mexico. We implemented processes to continuously monitor and strengthen our supply chain to proactively mitigate potential disruptions due to the pandemic. Management also instituted elevated procedures and practices to successfully manage liquidity, cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, capital expenditures and indebtedness during the pandemic.
 In addition, we initiated certain restructuring actions in fiscal 2021 to rationalize our operations, lower our costs and improve financial performance and long-term cash flow generation. These actions included plant consolidations and workforce reductions in the Automotive, Industrial and Interface segments. In fiscal 2021, we recognized $8.2 million of restructuring costs. We may take additional restructuring actions in future periods based upon market conditions and industry trends. 
 Operating Segments 
 Our business is managed, and our financial results are reported, based on the following four segments: Automotive, Industrial, Interface and Medical. See Note 15, “Segment Information and Geographic Area Information” to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for further information.
 The Automotive segment supplies electronic and electro-mechanical devices and related products to automobile OEMs, either directly or through their tiered suppliers. Our products include integrated center consoles, hidden switches, ergonomic switches, transmission lead-frames, LED-based lighting, and sensors which incorporate magneto-elastic sensing and other technologies that monitor the operation or status of a component or system.
 The Industrial segment manufactures external lighting solutions, industrial safety radio remote controls, braided flexible cables, current-carrying laminated busbars and devices, custom power-product assemblies, such as our PowerRail® solution, high-current low-voltage flexible power cabling systems and powder-coated busbars that are used in various markets and applications, including aerospace, cloud computing, commercial vehicles, industrial, military, power conversion and transportation.
 The Interface segment provides a variety of copper based transceivers and related accessories for the cloud computing hardware equipment and telecommunications broadband equipment markets, user interface solutions for the appliance, commercial food service, and point-of-sale equipment markets, and fluid-level sensors for the marine/recreational vehicle and sump pump markets.
 The Medical segment is made up of our medical device business, Dabir Surfaces, Inc. (“Dabir Surfaces”), our surface support technology aimed at pressure injury prevention. Dabir Surfaces has developed the technology for use by patients who are immobilized or otherwise at risk for pressure injuries, including patients undergoing long-duration surgical procedures.
 The following table reflects the percentage of net sales by segment for the last three fiscal years.
  
 | Fiscal Year Ended | 
-----------+-------------------+-----
 | May 1, 2021 | | | May 2, 2020 | | April 27, 2019
Automotive | | 69.4 | % | | 69.5 | % | 73.4 | %
Industrial | | 24.6 | % | | 24.6 | % | 20.7 | %
Interface | | 5.7 | % | | 5.7 | % | 5.8 | %
Medical | | 0.3 | % | | 0.2 | % | 0.1 | %

Sales and Marketing
 The majority of our sales activities are directed by sales managers who are supported by field application engineers and other technical personnel who work with customers to design our products into their systems. Our field application engineers also help us identify emerging markets and new products. Our products are primarily sold through our in-house sales staff. We also utilize independent manufacturers’ representatives with offices throughout the world. Information about our sales and operations in different geographic regions is summarized in Note 15, “Segment Information and Geographic Area Information” to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report. Sales are made primarily to OEMs, either directly or through their tiered suppliers, as well as to selling partners and distributors.

Sources and Availability of Materials
 The principal materials that we purchase include application-specific integrated circuits, coil and bar stock, ferrous and copper alloy sheets, glass, LED displays, plastic molding resins, capacitors and resistors, precious metals, and silicon die castings. All of these items are available from several suppliers and we generally rely on more than one supplier for each item.
 Intellectual Property
 We generally rely on patents, trade secrets, trademarks, licenses, and non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property and proprietary products. We have been granted a number of patents in the U.S., Europe and Asia and have additional domestic and international patent applications pending related to our products. Our existing patents expire on various dates between 2022 and 2041. We seek patents in order to protect our interest in unique and critical products and technologies, including our field-effect touch technology, magneto-elastic torque/force sensing, current sensing, displacement sensing, medical devices and radio-type products. We do not believe any single patent is material to our business, nor would the expiration or invalidity of any patent have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to compete.
Seasonality
 A significant portion of our business is dependent upon automotive and commercial vehicle industries. Consequently, our Automotive and Industrial segments may experience seasonal fluctuations based on the sales and the production schedules of our customers. The automotive and commercial vehicle markets are cyclical and depend on general economic conditions, interest rates, fuel prices and consumer spending patterns.
 Major Customers
During fiscal 2021, shipments to General Motors Corporation (“GM”) and Ford Motor Company (“Ford”), or their tiered suppliers, represented 27.5% and 8.8%, respectively, of consolidated net sales. In general, these sales were for component parts used in particular vehicle models of the OEMs. Typically, our GM and Ford supply arrangements for each component part include a blanket purchase order and production releases. In general, a blanket purchase order is issued for each GM or Ford part as identified by the customer part number. Each blanket purchase order includes standard terms and conditions, including price. In certain circumstances, we supply GM or Ford the requirements for a particular customer vehicle model for the life of the model, which can vary from three to seven years. Both GM and Ford order parts using production releases approved under the relevant blanket purchase order. The production releases are submitted by the various GM or Ford plants and include information regarding part quantities and delivery specifications.
Backlog
 We manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand. For many of our OEM customers, especially in the automotive and commercial vehicle markets, we have long-term supply arrangements where there is an expectation that we will supply products in future periods, however these arrangements do not necessarily constitute firm orders and these OEM customers are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. Firm orders are generally limited to authorized customer purchase orders which are typically based on customer release schedules. We fulfill these purchase orders as promptly as possible. The dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved. Accordingly, backlog at any given time might not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue.
Competition
 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid changes due to technological improvements and developments. We compete with a large number of other manufacturers in each of our product areas and many of these competitors have greater resources and sales. Price, service and product performance are significant elements of competition in the sale of our products.
 Research and Development
We maintain a research and development program involving a number of professional employees who devote a majority of their time to the enhancement of existing products and to the development of new products and processes. Research and development costs primarily relate to product engineering and design and development expenses and are classified as a component of costs of products sold on our consolidated statements of income. Expenditures for such activities amounted to $37.1 million for fiscal 2021, $34.9 million for fiscal 2020 and $41.2 million for fiscal 2019.

Government Regulations
 Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to international operations, environmental, export controls, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Annual Report for a discussion of these potential impacts.
Human Capital
 As of May 1, 2021, we employed approximately 7,200 employees worldwide, substantially all of whom were employed full time with approximately 94% of these employees located outside the U.S. Our U.S. employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements although certain international employees are covered by national or local labor agreements.
 Our corporate culture is committed to doing business with integrity, teamwork, and performance excellence. Our management team and all our employees are expected to exhibit the principles of fairness, honesty, and integrity in the actions we undertake. Our employees must adhere to our Code of Conduct that addresses topics such as anti-corruption, discrimination, harassment, privacy, appropriate use of company assets and protecting confidential information. Our employees participate in annual training on preventing, identifying, reporting, and stopping any type of unlawful discrimination or unethical actions.
 Talent Acquisition, Development and Succession Planning
 Our talent strategy is focused on attracting the best talent, recognizing, and rewarding their performance while continually developing, engaging, and retaining them. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. When we hire new employees, we focus not just on the skills required for current positions, but the ever-changing complex skills and competencies that will be required as we move forward. 
 We have a global talent review and succession planning process designed to align our talent plans with the current and future strategies of the business. This includes the identification of key positions, assessment of internal talent and potential successors and plans for talent development. Our teams meet with leaders and team members across the company to develop action plans and goals focused on both personal and professional development. 
 Diversity and Inclusion
 As highlighted in our Diversity & Inclusion Statement, we believe that diversity and inclusion are business imperatives that will enable us to build and empower our future workforce. We strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce that reflects our global customer base and the communities that we serve. We embrace the diversity of our employees, including their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts, and talents. Employees are valued and appreciated for their distinct contributions to the growth and sustainability of our business. We also strive for diversity in leadership, which has the power to drive innovation and to encompass a wide variety of perspectives in company decision-making. We believe that diversity and inclusion will make us a more desirable workplace and will lead to improved business performance.
Health and Safety
 The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees. We maintain a work environment with a safety culture grounded on the premise of eliminating workplace incidents, risks, and hazards. We have created and implemented processes to help eliminate safety events and reduce their frequency and severity. The safety of our employees is a top priority and vital to our success. Our employees are regularly trained on safety-related topics and we monitor and measure our effectiveness at all our locations.
 It is always a top priority, but in fiscal 2021 employee health and safety were of paramount importance due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. Where feasible, employees worked from home during fiscal 2021. For jobs that could not be done remotely, extensive safety measures were implemented, including equipping employees with PPE, temperature and health screenings, distanced workstations, plexiglass barriers, enhanced cleaning, and disinfection protocols, contact tracing when needed, published Safe Workplace Guidelines, employee training, and instituting other measures aimed at minimizing the transmission of COVID-19 while sustaining production and related services. Our safety measures are aligned with the recommendations of U.S. and global health organizations and have continued into fiscal 2022.

Benefits and Compensation
 As part of our efforts to attract and motivate our employees, we offer competitive compensation and benefits that may vary by region and employee-type. We provide compensation packages that include base salary/wages, and short and long-term incentives. We also provide employee benefits such as life, disability, and health (medical, dental, and vision) insurance, a 401(k) plan with a company match, paid time off, tuition reimbursement, military leave, and holiday pay. We believe those benefits are competitive within our industry.
 The Human Resources function at Methode is an active and visible partner to the business at all levels. Our Chief Human Resources Officer reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and interacts frequently with our Board of Directors. In fiscal 2022, our human capital focus will be on employee health and safety, employee and leadership development, and communications.
