ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
Vidler Water Resources, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in 1981. Until March 8, 2021 the Company’s name was PICO Holdings, Inc. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Vidler Water Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as “Vidler,” the “Company,” or by words such as “we,” “us,” and “our.” Our business is primarily operated through our wholly owned subsidiary, Vidler Water Company, Inc. (“Vidler Water ”).
Our business is to provide sustainable potable water resources to fast-growing communities throughout the Southwest U.S. that lack, or are running short of, available water resources.
We conduct our business by working closely with many constituents in these communities: regulators, water utilities, Native North American tribes, community leaders, residential and commercial developers and alternative energy companies. We ensure the water resources we develop and sell are sustainable and benefit the citizens of the communities and regions we serve.
Our objective is to maximize long-term shareholder value. Currently, we believe the highest potential return to our shareholders is from a return of capital. As we monetize our water and real estate assets, rather than reinvest the proceeds, we intend to return capital back to shareholders through a stock repurchase program or by other means such as special dividends. Nonetheless, we may, from time to time, reinvest a portion of proceeds from asset monetizations in further development of existing assets, if we believe the returns on such reinvestment outweigh the benefits of a return of capital.
Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and, if applicable, amendments to those reports, are available free of charge on our web site (www.vidlerwater.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our website also contains other material about our Company. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our corporate office is located at 3480 GS Richards Blvd., Suite 101, Carson City, Nevada 89703, and our telephone number is (775) 885-5000.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional information regarding the performance of and recent developments in our operating segments is included in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Our Business
We are primarily focused on monetizing, and further developing as necessary, our existing water rights, storage credits, and alternative energy sites that we own in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico. The long-term future demand for our existing water assets is driven by population and economic growth relative to currently available water supplies in the southwestern United States. We have developed sustainable sources of water for municipal and industrial use, either from existing supplies of water, such as water used for agricultural purposes, acquired unappropriated (previously unused) water, or discovered new sustainable water sources based on science and targeted exploration. Our alternative energy sites are in key locations that are adjacent to natural gas, fiber optic, power transmission and transportation corridors. We are not a water utility, and do not currently intend to enter into regulated utility activities.
A water right is the legal right to divert water and put it to beneficial use. Water rights are real property rights which can be bought and sold and are commonly measured in acre-feet (“AF”), which is a measure of the volume of water required to cover an area of one acre to a depth of one foot and is equal to 325,850 gallons. Almost all of our inventory of water rights are groundwater rights (water pumped from underground aquifers or basins) located in and governed by the state of Nevada. 
Nevada water law has a long history and has a few core principles governing the granting and use of water rights that emphasizes sustainability and the overall benefit of the water resource to the citizens of Nevada. First and foremost, owners of water rights must put the water granted to beneficial use or risk losing the water rights owned (‘use it or lose it”). Second, the annual volume of water rights granted and able to be put to beneficial use is limited to an estimate of the perennial yield of the basin from which the water right is pumped. The perennial yield is limited to the amount of natural discharge (represented by groundwater outflow from the basin or through evapotranspiration from plants) that can be pumped for beneficial use. The perennial yield can also be determined by an annual estimate of the volume of recharge (for example from rainfall or snow melt) that infiltrates into the basin from which water is pumped. In theory, groundwater basins in Nevada should never be depleted or overdrawn on a permanent basis based on this perennial yield doctrine. 
The value of a water right depends on a number of factors, which may include location, the seniority of the right, whether the right is transferable, or if the water can be moved from one location to another. We believe we have purchased water rights at prices consistent with their then current use, which was typically agricultural in nature, with the expectation that the value would increase as we converted the water rights through the development process to a higher use, such as municipal and industrial use. We acquired and developed sustainable water resources with the expectation that they would be the most, or one of the most, competitive sources of water (the most economical source of water supply) to support new growth in municipalities or new commercial and industrial projects.
The population growth of the states where we own water rights and storage credits continues to exceed the national growth rate, collectively and individually, with the exception of New Mexico. According to the Census Bureau’s estimate of state population changes for the period April 1, 2010, to July 1, 2020, Nevada’s growth rate was 16.2%, Arizona was 16.1%, Colorado was 15.5%, and New Mexico was 2.3%. These population growth statistics compare to the national total growth rate of 6.7% over the same period.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, certain jobs have become less tied to a physical office as “Work From Home” has become the norm. As a result, this may have temporarily or permanently changed the appeal or necessity of working in offices in large metropolitan areas in the future as people look for more affordable and spacious homes in less populated areas without the need for significant commutes to offices in larger metro areas. If this trend continues, we believe our assets are well located in the southwest to benefit from this transition.
Historically, a significant portion of the Southwest’s water supplies have come from the Colorado River. The balance is provided by other surface rights, such as rivers and lakes, groundwater (water pumped from underground aquifers), and water previously stored in reservoirs or aquifers. Prolonged droughts (decreased snow pack runoff and the related decreased surface water) together with rapid population growth in the past twenty years have reduced sustainable water supplies and exacerbated the region’s general water scarcity.
In December 2012, the U.S. Department of the Interior released a report titled: The Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study, examining the future water demands on the Colorado River Basin. The report projects water supply and demand imbalances throughout the Colorado River Basin and adjacent areas over the next 50 years. The average imbalance in future supply and demand is projected to be greater than 3.2 million acre-feet per year by 2060. The study projects that the largest increase in demand will come from municipal and industrial users as a result of population growth. The Colorado River Basin currently provides water to approximately 40 million people, and the study estimates that this population could nearly double to approximately 76.5 million people by 2060, under a rapid growth scenario.
In an effort to stave off severe shortages on the Colorado River system, the seven basin states established the Drought Contingency Plan (DCP). DCP was agreed to in the spring of 2019 and set a new lake level at which drought would be declared. In 2020 this level was reached and caused the implementation of delivery reductions to Arizona and Nevada. It is highly probable that the next level of delivery reductions will be declared for calendar year 2022. We expect this situation to make our Arizona Long-Term Storage Credits more valuable - both in the Harquahala Valley and in the Phoenix Active Management Area (AMA) - as our Long – Term Storage Credits can be used as an assured water supply.
There is a need for new water supplies in central Arizona, specifically in the Pinal AMA. The Pinal AMA is a largely agricultural area located between the metropolitan areas of Phoenix and Tucson. The Pinal AMA is experiencing a high rate of growth combined with a reduction in water supplies. According to the Arizona Department of Water Resources there is “…insufficient groundwater in the Pinal AMA to support all existing users and issued assured water supply determinations.” Our banked water in Harquahala Valley can be used as a new water supply to satisfy a portion of this unmet need. 
Certain areas of the Southwest confronting long-term growth have insufficient known supplies of water to support their future economic and population growth. The inefficient allocation of available water between agricultural users and municipal or industrial users, the lack of available known water supplies in a particular location, or inadequate infrastructure to fully utilize or store existing and new water supplies provide opportunities for us to apply our water resource development expertise.
The development of our water assets requires significant capital and expertise. A complete project, from acquisition, through development, permitting, and sale is typically a long-term endeavor. In the regions in which we operate, new housing and commercial and industrial developments require an assured, or sustainable, water supply (for example, in Arizona, access to water supplies for at least 100 years is required) before a permit for the development will be issued.
We have acquired or developed water rights and water related assets in Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Colorado, and New Mexico. We also developed and operate our own water storage facility near Phoenix, Arizona, utilize water storage capacity operated by third parties in Arizona, and “bank,” or store water for future growth with municipalities in Nevada and New Mexico.
We have also entered into “teaming” and joint resource development arrangements with third parties who have water assets but lack the capital or expertise to commercially develop these assets. The first of these arrangements was a water delivery teaming agreement in southern Nevada with the Lincoln County Water District (“Lincoln/Vidler”), which is developing sustainable water resources in Lincoln County, Nevada under the federal Lincoln County Land Act. In northwestern Nevada, we have also entered into a joint development agreement with Carson City and Lyon County, Nevada to develop and provide sustainable water resources in Lyon County as well as a water banking agreement with Truckee Meadows Water Authority (“TMWA”) in Reno, Nevada.
We generate revenues by:
•selling our developed water rights to real estate developers, alternative energy facilities or other commercial and industrial users who must secure rights to an assured, or sustainable, supply of water in order to receive permits for their development projects;
•selling our developed sustainable water rights to water utilities, municipalities, or other government agencies for their specific needs, including to support population and economic growth;
•selling our stored water to state agencies, commercial developers, or municipalities that have either exhausted their existing water supplies or require reserves for future water obligations, or, in instances where our water represents the most economical source of water, for their commercial projects or communities; and
•entitling, leasing, and selling of our water and land.
Our revenue and cash generation from the sale of our water resource and real estate assets can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and largely depends on when actual sale transactions close. We are unable to predict with any certainty the impact on the timing of any future asset sales and revenue and cash generation due to the economic contraction in the U.S. as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we believe if an economic contraction in the U.S. persists for several quarters, it is likely that future asset sales will be delayed, which could adversely affect our liquidity.
We owned the following significant water resources and water storage assets at December 31, 2020:
Fish Springs Ranch
We own a 51% membership interest in, and are the managing partner of, Fish Springs Ranch, LLC (“FSR”), which owns the Fish Springs Ranch and other properties totaling approximately 7,310 acres in Honey Lake Valley in Washoe County, Nevada approximately 40 miles north of Reno, Nevada. FSR also owns approximately 12,696 acre-feet of permitted water rights related to the properties of which 7,696 acre-feet are designated as water credits, available within the TMWA service area (such as Reno and Sparks) to support community development. The additional 5,000 acre-feet have been approved and permitted by the Nevada State Engineer. We are currently working on updating the existing federal rights of way through our existing Rights-of-Way grant for the project with the Bureau of Land Management before the water may be used in the TMWA service area. To date, we have funded all of the operational expenses, development, and construction costs incurred in this partnership. Certain of the development and construction costs are treated as preferred capital under the operating agreement which, among other things, entitles us to receive interest on the initial balance of the preferred capital and the accumulated interest at the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 450 basis points, As the publication of LIBOR will cease as of December 31, 2021, the Company is in the process of evaluating the alternatives to the LIBOR rate for the purposes of the interest calculation. The preferred capital and accumulated interest are first in line to be paid out as the partnership generates sufficient revenue. At December 31, 2020, the balance in the preferred capital account, including $100.9 million of accrued interest, was $195.5 million and the associated interest rate was 4.74%.
In July 2008, we completed construction of and dedicated our pipeline and associated infrastructure to Washoe County, Nevada under the terms of an Infrastructure Dedication Agreement (“IDA”) between Washoe County and FSR. Under the provisions of the IDA, Washoe County is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the pipeline, and we own the exclusive right to the capacity of the pipeline to allow for the sale of water for future economic development in the north valleys area of Reno. As of December 31, 2020, our remaining first phase 7,696 acre-feet of water that has full regulatory approval to be imported to the north valleys of Reno is available for sale under a Water Banking Trust Agreement entered into between FSR and Washoe County. Under the Water Banking Trust Agreement, Washoe County (now TMWA) holds our water rights in trust. We can sell our water credits to developers, who must then dedicate the water to the local water utility for service. In December 2014, Washoe County Water Utilities merged with TMWA, consolidating the water supply service in Washoe County. Also effective at the end of 2014, FSR, Washoe County, and TMWA consented to the assignment of the Water Banking Trust Agreement and the IDA to TMWA. Through this project we continue to work on the sustainability of water supplies for the North Valleys of Reno, and one that also provides a reliable resource in times of drought.
The FSR property is a working ranch and is comprised of 7,310 acres of our privately owned land and approximately 180,000 acres of a Bureau of Land Management grazing allotment. The land and allotment are currently leased to a cattle company for grazing. The ranch also grows alfalfa hay and grass hay that is sold to cattle operators, dairies and feed stores. In addition, we have entered into an option agreement with a solar company to lease up to 2,600 acres for solar panels and battery storage at $400 per acre, escalated at 2% per annum over a 26-year term with two additional 5-year extensions. As of December 31, 2020, the solar company has exercised on 727.8 acres and paid the first lease payment of $291,000. The solar company has elected to continue to option approximately 1,365 acres in preparation for future alternative energy projects. 
Carson/Lyon
The capital of Nevada, Carson City, and Lyon County are located in the northwestern part of the state, close to Lake Tahoe and the border with California. While Carson City’s housing growth has been and is expected to be modest due to land constraints, there is planned growth for the Dayton corridor, directly east of Carson City. The planned growth in this area is anticipated to be driven by the employment growth at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (“TRIC”) and the completion of the extension of the USA Parkway which connects Interstate route 80 to TRIC and to U.S. route 50 near Silver Springs, Lyon County, Nevada. There are currently few existing sustainable water sources to support future growth and development in the Dayton corridor area. We continue to work with Carson City and Lyon County on ways to deliver a sustainable water supply to support this expected economic expansion.
We have development and improvement agreements with both Carson City and Lyon County to provide water resources for planned future growth in Lyon County and to connect, or “intertie,” the municipal water systems of Carson City and Lyon County. The agreements allow for certain river water rights owned or controlled by us to be conveyed for use in Lyon County. The agreements also allow us to bank water with Lyon County and authorize us to build the infrastructure to upgrade and inter-connect the Carson City and Lyon County water systems.
We own or control, by means of option agreements, water rights consisting of both Carson River agriculture designated surface water rights and certain municipal and industrial designated groundwater rights. We anticipate that we will have up to approximately 4,192 acre-feet available (through owned and optioned water rights) for municipal/industrial use in Lyon County for future development, as demand occurs, principally by means of delivery through the infrastructure we constructed.
To assist in regional solutions, Vidler is providing “in-kind” labor and expertise to obtain Right-of-Way from the Bureau of Land Management and Nevada Department of Transportation for Water, Sewer, Reclaimed Water utilities along the Highway 50 corridor between Dayton and Silver Springs. While there are no plans for construction at this time, this is a project to further our ability to market and sell our water rights to potential residential and commercial developments in and around the Stagecoach, Lyon County area in the Highway 50 corridor. We believe there are several development projects in process in this region that do not appear to have a sustainable water supply to allow these potential projects to progress. We believe that, if we are able to deliver our water through infrastructure to the Stagecoach area, there will be significant demand for our water rights due to the lack of alternative water supplies. 
Vidler Arizona Recharge Facility
We built and received the necessary permits to operate a full-scale water “recharge” facility that allowed us to bank water underground in the Harquahala Valley, Arizona. “Recharge” is the process of placing water into storage underground for future use. When needed, the water will be “recovered,” or removed from storage, through groundwater wells. Under Arizona Law this stored water creates a long-term storage credit (“LTSC”). The Arizona Department of Water Resources tracks and documents the LTSCs stored throughout Arizona. 
At this facility, we recharged Colorado River water, which is a primary source of water for the Lower Basin States of Arizona, California, and Nevada. The water storage facility is strategically located adjacent to the Central Arizona Project (“CAP”) aqueduct, a conveyance canal running from Lake Havasu to Phoenix and Tucson. Our recharged water was purchased from surplus flows of CAP water. Proximity to the CAP aqueduct provides a competitive advantage as it minimizes the cost of water conveyance of our LTSCs. 
Potential users include industrial companies, alternative energy (solar and green hydrogen) companies, developers, and local governmental political subdivisions in Arizona, including municipalities and incorporated areas. The Arizona Water Banking Authority (“AWBA”) has the responsibility for intrastate and interstate storage of water for governmental entities. To date, we have not stored water at the facility for any specific third party and there is no longer excess water which can be banked.
While Arizona was the only southwestern state with surplus flows of Colorado River water available for storage, there are currently no surplus flows available to us as drought conditions have reduced the flow of the Colorado River and other water users have fully utilized their water allocations. In the future, we do not anticipate purchasing and storing surplus flows of Colorado River water, and we have discontinued using the recharge element of the storage site. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 250,682 acre-feet of LTSCs stored at our facility. 
Phoenix AMA Water Storage
As of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 28,147 acre-feet of LTSCs stored in the Phoenix Active Management Area (“AMA”). We have approximately 200 acre-feet left to be purchased on a seven-year contract that expires in November 2021. Water stored in the AMA may be recovered and used anywhere in the AMA and could have a variety of uses for residential and commercial developments within the Phoenix metropolitan area such as the sale we consummated in 2019 with the City of El Mirage for 25,000 acre-feet of LTSCs. All of the storage sites we utilize within the AMA are operated by third parties.
Harquahala Valley Ground Water Basin
As of December 31, 2020, we owned 1,926 acres of land associated with the Vidler Recharge Facility and surrounding areas. Currently, there is interest from solar development companies in this property and associated banked water. We believe this land has more potential for solar development than any residential developments and therefore we will likely not renew our Analysis of Adequate Water Supply on our land by December 2021.
Lincoln County, Nevada Water Delivery and Teaming Agreement
Lincoln County, Nevada (“Lincoln”) and Vidler entered into a water delivery teaming agreement to locate and develop water resources in Lincoln County, Nevada for planned projects pursuant to the Lincoln County master plan. Under the agreement, proceeds from sales of water will be shared equally after Vidler is reimbursed for the expenses incurred in developing water resources in Lincoln County. Lincoln/Vidler has filed applications within Lincoln County for more than 100,000 acre-feet of water rights, with the intention of supplying water for residential, commercial, and industrial use, as contemplated by the county’s approved master plan. We believe that this is the only known new source of water for Lincoln County. Although it is uncertain, Vidler currently anticipates that over the long-term, up to 40,000 acre-feet of water rights will ultimately be permitted from these applications, and put to use for planned projects in Lincoln County.
Tule Desert Groundwater Basin
Lincoln/Vidler jointly filed permit applications in 1998 for approximately 14,000 acre-feet of water rights for industrial use from the Tule Desert Groundwater Basin in Lincoln County, Nevada. In November 2002, the Nevada State Engineer awarded Lincoln/Vidler a permit for 2,100 acre-feet of water rights, which Lincoln/Vidler subsequently sold in 2005; the State Engineer ruled that an additional 7,240 acre-feet could be granted pending additional studies by Lincoln/Vidler (the “2002 Ruling”). Subsequent to the 2002 Ruling and consistent with the Nevada State Engineer’s conditions, we completed these additional engineering and scientific studies and provided this information to the State of Nevada and other regulatory bodies.
On April 15, 2010, Lincoln/Vidler and the Nevada State Engineer announced a Settlement Agreement with respect to litigation between the parties regarding the amount of water to be permitted in the Tule Desert Groundwater Basin. The Settlement Agreement resulted in the granting to Lincoln/Vidler of the original application of 7,240 acre-feet of water rights with an initial 2,900 acre-feet of water rights available for sale or lease by Lincoln/Vidler. The balance of the water rights (4,340 acre-feet) is the subject of staged pumping and development over the next several years to further refine the modeling of the basin and potential impacts, if any, from deep aquifer pumping in the remote, unpopulated desert valley in Lincoln County, Nevada.
The Tule Desert Groundwater Basin water resources were developed by Lincoln/Vidler to sustainably support the Lincoln County Recreation, Conservation and Development Act of 2004 (the “Land Act”). The water permitted under the Settlement Agreement is anticipated to provide sufficient and sustainable water resources for a portion of the Land Act properties.
Kane Springs
In 2005, Lincoln/Vidler agreed to sell water to a developer of Coyote Springs, a new planned residential and commercial development 60 miles north of Las Vegas, as and when supplies were permitted from Lincoln/Vidler’s existing applications in Kane Springs, Nevada. Lincoln/Vidler currently has priority applications for approximately 17,375 acre-feet of water in Kane Springs for which the Nevada State Engineer has requested additional data, before making a determination on the applications from this groundwater basin. The actual permits received may be for a lesser quantity, which cannot be accurately predicted.
Lincoln/Vidler entered into an agreement to sell water to Coyote Springs Investments (“CSI”); CSI is the developer of Coyote Springs, a new planned residential and commercial development 60 miles north of Las Vegas. Of the permitted water rights in Kane Springs Valley, Vidler agreed to sell to CSI 500 acre-feet of those permitted water rights pursuant to a purchase option agreement.
Following hearings conducted by the Nevada State Engineer in late September early-October of 2019 to determine the boundaries of the Lower White River Flow System (“LWRFS”) in Southern Nevada, the Nevada State Engineer, on June 20, 2020, issued Order No.1309, finding that Kane Springs Valley was now to be included as part of the LWRFS. This Order results in subordinating Lincoln/Vidler’s senior priority water right date of their current permitted water rights in Kane Springs Valley to the respective priority dates in relation to all other water rights in the new multi-basin area “Super Basin.” If the Order stands, it will likely impede Lincoln/Vidler from pursuing its existing permitted water rights and applications in the Kane Springs Valley Basin and will adversely affect its contracts with CSI.
Lincoln/Vidler believes that the Kane Springs Valley Basin is not a part of the LWRFS and presented evidence to this effect at the State Engineer’s hearings. Lincoln/Vidler believes there is no legal authority in existing Nevada water law statutes that allows the State Engineer to create a “Super Basin” and disregard long-standing existing individual basin boundaries and water right priorities within those individual basin boundaries.
Lincoln/Vidler have filed a Petition for Judicial review appealing Order No. 1309, as well as a ‘takings’ claim against the State of Nevada for the subordination of Lincoln/Vidler’s water right priority. CSI, as well as others, have also appealed this Order, and Lincoln/Vidler anticipates supporting CSI in its appeal. Given the number of participants in the appeal, a lengthy period may pass before the matter is resolved. Our appeal and takings claim is in the early stages of the legal process and, as such, it is difficult to evaluate the ultimate outcome of our appeal of the Order. An adverse ruling would materially and adversely affect Lincoln/Vidler’s investment in the Kane Springs Valley Basin and its contracts with CSI. If there is an adverse ruling on the appeal, the current option agreement with CSI could result in forgone revenue of up to $3.5 million.
