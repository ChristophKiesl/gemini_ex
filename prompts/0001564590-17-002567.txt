ITEM 1.  BUSINESS 
Our Company
 All references to "LSB Industries,” “LSB,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to LSB Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes clear that the reference is only to LSB Industries, Inc. itself and not its subsidiaries. Notes referenced throughout this document refer to consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures that are found in Item 8.
 The Company was formed in 1968 as an Oklahoma corporation and became a Delaware corporation in 1977. We are a manufacturer and distributor of nitrogen fertilizer and other nitrogen products principally in North America. Our principal customers are cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, farmers and industrial users. Our principal nitrogen products are:
  
• | ammonia, fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate (“AN” and “HDAN”), urea ammonia nitrate (“UAN”), and AN solution for agricultural applications,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | high purity and commercial grade ammonia, high purity AN, sulfuric acids, concentrated, blended and regular nitric acid, mixed nitrating acids, carbon dioxide, and diesel exhaust fluid for industrial applications, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | industrial grade AN (“LDAN”) and 83% AN solution (“AN solution”) for the mining industry.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We manufacture and distribute our products in four facilities: three owned facilities located in El Dorado, Arkansas (the “El Dorado Facility”), Cherokee, Alabama (the “Cherokee Facility”), and Pryor, Oklahoma (the “Pryor Facility”), and one facility we operate on behalf of Covestro AG (“Covestro”) in Baytown, Texas (the “Baytown Facility”).
 The following table summarizes net sales information relating to our products:
 
 
 | 2016 | | | 2015 | | 2014
---------------------------------------------+------+-----+---+------+-----+-----
Percentage of consolidated net sales: | | | | | | | | 
Agricultural products | | 44 | % | | 48 | % | 46 | %
Industrial acids and other chemical products | | 42 | % | | 38 | % | 35 | %
Mining products | | 12 | % | | 11 | % | 14 | %
Other products | | 2 | % | | 3 | % | 5 | %
 | | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

 
Prior to July 1, 2016, we manufactured and sold a range of heating, ventilation and air conditioning products and related services (the “Climate Control Business”). These products were primarily used in commercial, institutional and residential new building construction and renovations. On July 1, 2016, we sold the Climate Control Business for a total of $364 million before customary adjustments set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement, as detailed more fully in Item 7 of this report.
 For information regarding revenues, operating profits or losses and total assets for the Company for the past three fiscal years, see the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
 Strategy
 We pursue a strategy of balancing the sale of product as fertilizer into the agriculture markets at spot prices and developing industrial and mining customers that purchase substantial quantities of products, primarily under contractual obligations and/or pricing arrangements that provide for the pass through of raw material and other manufacturing costs.  We believe that this product and market diversification strategy allows us to have consistent levels of production and helps mitigate the volatility risk inherent in the prices of our raw material feedstocks and/or the changes in demand for our products.  For 2016, approximately 54% of our sales were to the industrial and mining markets and approximately 44% of our sales were to the agricultural markets, primarily at the market price at the time of sale.
 The strategy of developing industrial and mining customers is to moderate the risk inherent in the agricultural markets where spot sales prices of our agricultural products may not have a correlation to the natural gas feedstock costs but rather reflect market conditions for like and competing nitrogen sources.  This volatility of sales pricing in our agricultural products can compromise our ability to recover our full cost to produce the product in this market.  Additionally, the lack of sufficient non-seasonal agricultural sales volume to operate our manufacturing facilities at optimum levels can preclude us from balancing production and storage capabilities.  Looking forward, we are pursuing profitable growth.  Our strategy calls for continued emphasis on the agricultural sector, while remaining committed to further developing industrial customers who assume the volatility risk associated with the raw material costs and mitigate the effects of seasonality in the agricultural sector.

Our strategy also includes evaluating investment in expansion projects, along with reliability and efficiency improvement projects, that we believe will generate the best returns for our stockholders taking into consideration the risk and return on investment.  This strategy motivated our decision to build the ammonia plant at the El Dorado Facility and to construct a new nitric acid plant and concentrator at the El Dorado Facility.  All three projects have been completed.  We believe that we will benefit from these projects through reduced feedstock costs, expanded capacity, improved efficiency and enhanced product mix flexibility.
 Key Initiatives for 2017
 We believe our future results of operations and financial condition will depend significantly on our ability to successfully implement the following key initiatives:
  
• | Improving the on-stream rates of our chemical plants. We have made and continue to make: (1) upgrades to the operations teams at our chemical facilities; (2) investments of capital to enhance the reliability of each of our plants at each facility in order to reduce unplanned outages, unplanned downtimes, and the frequency of planned Turnarounds; and (3) continued efforts to focus on safety and efficiency throughout our entire operations. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broadening the distribution of our AN and Nitric Acid products. Given the reduction in our LDAN sales from the declining use of coal, we have expanded our overall sales of HDAN through a number of marketing initiatives that have broadened our addressable market. Those initiatives have included, storing and distributing HDAN at our Pryor and Cherokee Facilities and selling to new markets and customers out of those facilities. In addition, through our marketing efforts, we are working on expanding our market for our nitric acid products to parts of the Western U.S. and Canada. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reducing and controlling our cost structure. In 2016, we put in place SG&A expense reductions of approximately $6 million per year that we will realize beginning in 2017. In addition, beginning in 2017 we have reduced plant costs at each manufacturing facility by approximately $6 million. We continue to review our overall costs and believe that we will be able to further reduce costs during 2017. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selling non-core assets. In 2016, we identified assets that are no longer necessary in the operations of our business. Those assets include our working interest in the natural gas properties in the Marcellus Shale, our engineered products business, certain pieces of equipment and certain real estate. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we sold a portion of this equipment for approximately $5 million and are in the process of selling certain other non-core assets, which we believe could generate an additional approximately $15 million to $20 million of net cash proceeds (net of any debt outstanding against these assets).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evaluate strategic initiatives for our business. We have initiated a process to explore and evaluate potential strategic alternatives for our business, which may include a sale, a merger with another party, or another strategic transaction involving some or all of our assets. We have retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC as our financial advisor to assist with this process.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We may not successfully implement any or all of these initiatives.  Even if we successfully implement the initiatives, they may not achieve the beneficial results that we expect or desire.
 Market Conditions
 As discussed in more detail under “Key Industry Factors” of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) contained in Item 7 of this report, agricultural fertilizer demand is a significant driver of our sales volumes.  This demand is influenced by the number of acres planted of crops, principally corn, that require fertilizer to grow and to enhance yield.  Corn prices affect the number of acres of corn planted in a given year, and the number of acres planted will influence nitrogen fertilizer consumption, likely affecting ammonia, UAN and urea prices.  Weather also has an effect on fertilizer application and consumption.  
 The 2016 corn crop produced 15.1 billion bushels with an average yield of 174.6 bushels per acre, increases of approximately 11% and 4% respectively compared to 2015.  This increase in production and yield has increased 2016 ending stocks of corn to record levels.  However, current estimates call for a reduction in 2017 corn acres planted of approximately 3 million acres to between 90 to 91 million acres. We believe that combined with the United States (“U.S.”) continuing to be a net exporter of corn in 2017, should reduce the stocks-to-use ratios and have a positive impact on the price of corn. As a result, the fundamentals are positive for nitrogen fertilizers that are necessary to grow and enhance the yield per acre for most major crops. 
 In our industrial markets, our sales volumes are typically driven by changes in general economic conditions, energy prices, and our contractual arrangements with certain large customers. Our mining products are generally sold into the coal, metals and mineral mining and aggregates markets with the majority of those sales being sold into the coal markets.  As such, U.S. annual coal production will drive sale volumes of our mining products and over the past several years, U.S. coal production has been negatively impacted by low natural gas prices among other things. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) reported, that annual coal production 
 4


for 2016 was estimated to be down 17% from 2015.  However, they are estimating annual coal production to increase 7% for 2017 and remain stable into 2018 which should provide better market conditions for the sales of our mining products.  In addition, the metals and mineral mining markets have been and continue to be negatively impacted by commodity price decreases which have curtailed their activity and negatively impacted our sales into that market.
 Natural gas is the basic feedstock for the production of ammonia and therefore natural gas prices have a significant impact on the production cost of our ammonia.  Given the current relatively low price of natural gas in North America and the expectation that pricing of natural gas will remain relatively low for the foreseeable future, North American ammonia producers are the low-cost producers of ammonia that is consumed in North America and the expectation is that will continue. 
 That low cost of production led to a number of new announced brownfield and greenfield nitrogen expansion projects in the U.S. Many of those projects have now been cancelled or put on hold.  However, a number of the announced expansion projects have either been completed and begun production or are under construction and will go into production during 2017. These expansion projects are expected to increase ammonia production in the U.S. by approximately 5 million tons annually in addition to expansion of other upgraded nitrogen products.  This additional domestic ammonia and other upgraded product production is expected to replace product that is currently being imported into North America.  However, the amount and timing of new nitrogen production could have a negative effect on selling prices of nitrogen based products in 2017.
 Agricultural Products 
 We produce UAN, HDAN, and ammonia, all of which are nitrogen-based fertilizers.  Farmers and ranchers decide which type of nitrogen-based fertilizer to apply based on the crop planted, soil and weather conditions, regional farming practices and relative nitrogen fertilizer prices.  Our agricultural markets include a high concentration of pastureland and row crops, which favor our products.  We sell these agricultural products to farmers, ranchers, fertilizer dealers and distributors primarily in the ranch land and grain production markets in the U.S.  We develop our market position in these areas by emphasizing high quality products, customer service and technical advice.  During the past few years, we have been successful in expanding outside our traditional markets by delivering to distributors on the Tennessee and Ohio rivers by barge, and by delivering to certain Western States by rail.  
 Our agricultural business establishes long-term relationships with wholesale agricultural distributors and retailers and also sells directly to agricultural end-users through our network of 11 wholesale and retail distribution centers. In addition, we have an agreement with a third-party purchaser (Coffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers, LLC, “CVR”), to market and sell a portion of our UAN.  Demand for sales under this agreement is based on the expected needs of the purchaser’s customers.  The agreement provides the exclusive right (but not the obligation) to purchase, at market prices, substantially all of the UAN produced at the Pryor Facility in excess of the needs of the Pryor Facility or its affiliates up to 30,000 tons per year.  The term of the agreement runs through June 2019 with annual renewal options, but may be terminated earlier by either party pursuant to the terms of the agreement.  See our discussion above concerning broadening the distribution of our AN products under “Key Initiatives for 2017”.
 We sell most of our agricultural products at the current spot market price in effect at the time of shipment, although we periodically enter into forward sales commitments for some of these products.  Sales of our industrial and mining products are generally made to customers pursuant to sales contracts or pricing arrangements on terms that include the cost of raw material feedstock as a pass-through component in the sales price.  These contractual sales stabilize the effect of commodity cost changes and fluctuations in demand for these products due to the cyclicality of the end markets.
 Industrial Acids and Other Chemical Products
 We manufacture and sell industrial acids and other chemical products primarily to the polyurethane, paper, fibers, emission control, and electronics industries.  In addition, we produce and sell blended and regular nitric acid and industrial and high purity ammonia for many specialty applications, including the reduction of air emissions from power plants. In addition, in November 2015, one of our subsidiaries, El Dorado Chemical Company (“EDC”) and Koch Fertilizer entered into an ammonia purchase and sale agreement under which Koch Fertilizer agreed to purchase, with minimum purchase requirements, the ammonia that is in excess of EDC’s internal needs as the result of the El Dorado expansion project completed in the second quarter of 2016.  We began selling ammonia under this agreement during June 2016.
 We operate the Baytown Facility on behalf of Covestro and we believe it is one of the newest, largest and most technologically advanced nitric acid manufacturing units in the U.S.  The majority of the Baytown Facility’s production is sold to Covestro pursuant to a long-term contract (the “Covestro Agreement”). This agreement: (a) allows us to pass-through most of the costs of producing the nitric acid that Covestro purchases, including the cost of ammonia; (b) to receive management fees for managing the operations and marketing nitric acid at the Baytown Facility and; (c) to receive a portion of any carbon credits that are sold. The term of this agreement runs until June 2021 with options for renewal.
 Our industrial business competes based upon service, price and location of production and distribution sites, product quality and performance and provides inventory management as part of the value-added services offered to certain customers.  See our discussion above concerning broadening the distribution of our Nitric Acid products under “Key Initiatives for 2017”.

Mining Products 
 Our mining products are LDAN and AN solution.  We sell LDAN and AN solution directly to explosive distributors, mining companies and aggregate companies who sell into the coal mining, metals mining and construction industries.  We have signed long-term contracts with customers that provide for the sale of LDAN of approximately 70,000 tons per year under various natural gas-cost-plus-a-fixed-dollar-amount pricing arrangements.     
Dependence on Limited Number of Customers 
 As discussed in various risk factors under Item 1A, historically, we have relied on a limited number of customers. Information relating to our significant customers for each of the last three years appears in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
Raw Materials
 The products we manufacture are primarily derived from natural gas and ammonia.  These raw material feedstocks are commodities and subject to price fluctuations. 
 Natural gas is the primary raw material for producing ammonia, UAN and other products at our El Dorado, Cherokee and Pryor Facilities. When operating at optimum on-stream rates, the El Dorado Facility would purchase approximately 15.5 million MMBtus to produce approximately 450,000 tons of ammonia; the Cherokee Facility would purchase approximately 6 million MMBtus of natural gas per year in order to produce approximately 180,000 tons of ammonia; and the Pryor Facility would purchase approximately 7 million MMBtus of natural gas to produce approximately 235,000 tons of ammonia.
 The chemical facilities’ natural gas feedstock requirements are generally purchased at spot market price.  Periodically, we enter into volume purchase commitments and/or futures/forward contracts to lock in the cost of certain of the expected natural gas requirements.  As of December 31, 2016, we had volume purchase commitments with a fixed cost for natural gas of approximately 2.4 million MMBtus at an average cost of $3.20 per MMBtu. These commitments are for firm purchases during the first quarter of 2017 and represent approximately 41% of our total exposed natural gas usage required for that period.  In January 2017, we increased our volume purchase commitments with a fixed cost for natural gas to approximately 3.4 million MMBtus at an average cost of $3.28 per MMBtu. With the additional commitments, which now extend through June 2017, we have approximately 53% of our total exposed natural gas usage requirements at an average price of $3.28 for the first quarter of 2017 and 20% of our total exposed natural gas usage requirements at an average price of $3.35 for the second quarter of 2017.
 The Baytown Facility normally purchases approximately 135,000 tons of ammonia per year. However, under our long-term contract for that facility, we pass through the full cost of the ammonia leaving us with no exposure to ammonia price fluctuations. 
 See further discussion relating to the outlook for our business under “Key Industry Factors” in our MD&A contained in this report.
 Seasonality
 We believe fertilizer products sold to the agricultural industry are seasonal while sales into the industrial and mining sectors generally are not.  The selling seasons for agricultural products are primarily during the spring and fall planting seasons, which typically extend from March through June and from September through November in the geographical markets in which the majority of our agricultural products are distributed.  As a result, we typically increase our inventory of fertilizer products prior to the beginning of each planting season in order to meet the demand for our products.  In addition, the amount and timing of sales to the agricultural markets depend upon weather conditions and other circumstances beyond our control. 
Regulatory Matters
 We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations as discussed under “Environmental, Health and Safety Matters" of this Item 1 and various risk factors under Item 1A.
Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive market with many other larger chemical companies, such as Agrium Inc., CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Chemtrade Logistics Inc., CVR Partners, LP, OCI Partners LP, Dyno Nobel, The Gavilon Group, Helm AG, Koch Industries, Norfalco, Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Praxair, Inc., Quad Chemical Corporation, Trammo Inc. and Yara International (some of whom are our customers), many of whom have greater financial and other resources than we do.  We believe that competition within the markets we serve is primarily based upon service, price, location of production and distribution sites, and product quality and performance.

Additional Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales
For each of the last three years, all of our net sales and long-lived assets relate to domestic operations. In addition, net sales to non-U.S. customers were minimal.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed 610 persons, 195 of whom are represented by unions under agreements that expire in July of 2018 through November of 2019. 
 Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
 Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and to other laws regarding health and safety matters (the “Environmental and Health Laws”). In particular, the manufacture, production and distribution of our products are activities that entail environmental and public health risks and impose obligations under the Environmental and Health Laws, many of which provide for certain performance obligations, substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Certain Environmental and Health Laws impose strict liability as well as joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In connection with certain acquisitions, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses. In certain instances, citizen groups also have the ability to bring legal proceedings against us if we are not in compliance with environmental laws, or to challenge our ability to receive environmental permits that we need to operate. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety effects of our operations.
 There can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in complying with such laws or in paying fines or penalties for violation of such laws.  Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us. The Environmental and Health Laws and enforcement policies thereunder have in the past resulted, and could in the future result, in significant compliance expenses, cleanup costs (for our sites or third-party sites where our wastes were disposed of), penalties or other liabilities relating to the handling, manufacture, use, emission, discharge or disposal of hazardous or toxic materials at or from our facilities or the use or disposal of certain of its chemical products.  Historically, our subsidiaries have incurred significant expenditures in order to comply with the Environmental and Health Laws and are reasonably expected to do so in the future. We will also be obligated to manage certain discharge water outlets and monitor groundwater contaminants at our chemical facilities should we discontinue the operations of a facility.
