Overview 
 We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our Initial Business Combination. Our mission is to partner with leading businesses at the intersection of health care, life sciences and technology to redesign health care around the patient. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to the Initial Public Offering. We have not selected any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. We have generated no operating revenues to date, and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our Initial Business Combination. 
Initial Public Offering 
 On March 22, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 55,000,000 Stakeholder Aligned Initial Listing securities, or SAILSM securities (each, a “SAIL”, and collectively, “SAILs”), including 5,000,000 SAILs as a result of the underwriters’ exercise in part of their over-allotment option. The SAILs were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per SAIL, generating gross proceeds of $550.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $31.0 million, of which approximately $19.3 million was for deferred underwriting commissions. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 12,000,000 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”), at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant with our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $18.0 million. 
 Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $550.0 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement were placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”) located in the United States, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and were invested only in U.S. “government securities,” within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of an Initial Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.

Market Opportunity 
 We believe the intersection of health care, life sciences and technology is one of the most significant value creative opportunities of this decade. Although the U.S. spends $4 trillion on health care each year, the U.S. 
 
15 

  healthcare system can be extremely difficult and painful to navigate. It fails to provide positive experiences for the consumer, and thereby leads to a behavior of avoidance of care unless deemed absolutely necessary. As a result, those suffering with disease are often neglected by the health care system, whether or not by choice, and those who would otherwise be more proactive fail to procure care due to the health care system’s inherent complexity. We believe there is a huge opportunity to address these inefficiencies and reduce U.S. health care spend while still capturing immense value. If tech entrepreneurs and the traditional health care ecosystem, including the life sciences sector, work together to realign health care around the patient, we believe the space will generate more than ten to fifteen $100 billion companies. 
 As part of our initial market assessment, we have identified the mental health and well-being segment as the most significant unmet need in the U.S. health care system today. Mental health-spanning services such as wellness, talk therapy, addiction and medication-tops the list of medical spending categories with $212 billion in annual health care spend, beating both cardiovascular disease and diabetes by a substantial margin, and an estimated 51.5 million American adults (i.e., 20% of American adults) suffer from mental illness. Furthermore, these numbers only scratch the surface of what the true cost is of the crisis-it is estimated that an additional $192 billion of earnings is lost each year due to mental health related absenteeism, which doesn’t even include indirect costs, like productivity, employee turnover and job satisfaction. As a result, and further exacerbated by the adverse psychological impacts of COVID-19, we have found ourselves in the midst of a mental health pandemic afflicting people around the world and impacting people across the age and socioeconomic spectrum. 
 However, since mental health treatment does not always require physical presence, it is an ideal place to use technology to connect patients with doctors, therapists, software and hardware applications, and perhaps most importantly, each other. It is also an area of care that lacks well adjudicated and informed ways to measure the success of various treatments, including pharmaceuticals. We believe that the time is right for this to change through the use of modern tools. RHAC is exploring comprehensive solutions in mental health across the continuum of well-being, prevention and treatment that we believe can address all patients seeking treatment, regardless of disease severity. The unmet need is immense, and so too is the benefit to people and society. 
 Our business combination and value creation strategy is to identify and complete our Initial Business Combination with this substantial market opportunity existing at this intersection of health care, life sciences and technology. Globally, there are 46 health care unicorns, valued in aggregate at $110 billion, with over $55 billion of cumulative value in digital health unicorns alone. The public markets have seen the successful IPOs of several multi-billion dollar digital health companies over the last few years, including Teladoc, Amwell, and GoodRx, which currently have a combined market value of >$55 billion. This growth in the digital health sector is only set to increase with the tailwinds presented by catalyzing events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, evidenced by a record-setting $8.9 billion of digital health venture funding in 2020. 
 As the last several months have demonstrated, periods of market volatility and dislocation can present even the highest quality health care, life sciences or technology companies with challenges accessing the public markets through a traditional IPO. While there has been an increasing number of health care and technology-focused blank check companies issued in recent months, we believe no other has the same degree of coherent vision, alignment with stakeholders, combination of sector expertise, entrepreneurial mindset, track record, and desire for transformational change. We believe we can provide a high-quality company with a lower risk path to the public capital markets while also providing our investors option value on an investment in these types of companies during periods of market volatility. The recent cohort of blank check company IPOs and validation by the involvement of bulge bracket investment banks and advisors have shown support for the effectiveness of this vehicle and substantiates our strategy. Revolution Healthcare Acquisition Corp. will be the only blank check company searching for its Initial Business Combination led by a team that includes seasoned health care, life sciences and technology company founders and entrepreneurs with operational public company experience and an unprecedented track record for successfully effecting positive change. We believe the market opportunity is aligned with the advantages we bring to a potential target and the vehicle allows us to leverage our capabilities and create value by serving massive unmet market needs.

Our Business Strategy 
 The U.S. health care system has reached a pivotal moment as the lines between health care, life sciences and technology have blurred, and the next generation of innovation is ushered in through a digital transformation of health care. Concurrently, the consumer (i.e., the patient) has grown increasingly more frustrated by the sick, rigid and broken health care system and yearns to be empowered by broadly accessible, intuitive solutions that serve to enhance their experience and optimize clinical outcomes. Our goal is to invest in revolutionary platforms that will drive the transformation of our health care system into a patient-centric technology-driven model of care. We will facilitate this paradigm shift with technologies like wearable sensors, remote continuous data capture, point of care diagnostics, telehealth capabilities and artificial intelligence/machine learning tools. 
 More specifically, we have identified the mental health and well-being segment as the largest underserved medical need in the U.S. health care system today. It is an area so underappreciated and stigmatized that most insurers don’t cover costs for care. Mental, emotional and spiritual suffering are no less real than physical suffering. But whereas sufferers of physical ailments have access and coverage, those suffering from conditions of the mind must bear the pain alone. As a result of limited mental health care options, 60% of youth diagnosed 
 
17 

  with depression in the U.S. do not receive any form of mental health care. Furthermore, there is low adoption of evidence-based treatment models and algorithms-the shortage of office-based psychiatrists coupled with the stigma associated with office-based care drives a significantly undertreated population; roles of talk therapy and drug therapy are poorly defined and no central data repositories exist for studying effectiveness of different treatment regimens or predicting successful outcomes. 
 The unmet need within mental health in the U.S. is underscored by looking at recent suicide statistics-suicide today is responsible for killing more soldiers than combat, claims more lives in the U.S. than breast cancer and has become the second most leading cause of death in the U.S. for people under 34 years old. In addition, over 18% of American adults have anxiety, 10% of American youths have severe major depression, roughly 20 million adults struggle with substance abuse and over 70 million Americans die each year from drug overdose. 
 Analogous to prevention and treatment of physical ailments, there is a spectrum of mental and behavioral health and well-being. It ranges from preventive practices (e.g., cognitive programs, digital therapeutics, mindfulness, etc.), to clinical therapy (e.g., individual and group therapy), and finally institutional care that takes place at outpatient facilities or mental hospitals. And because mental health doesn’t require physical presence, it is an ideal place to use technology to connect patients with doctors, therapists, software and hardware applications, and perhaps most importantly, each other to deliver more personalized care. Further, from the more recent influence of genetics and prenatal health, we are able to learn more about the critical points in brain development and life experiences that increase the risk for the development of mental health disorders-this innovation has begun to play a key role in driving preventative care models through lightweight therapy, building emotional skill sets and other important practices. Our vision for a total health care revolution focuses into the mental health arena in expanding care through technology and evidence-based integrated treatment protocols to deliver personalized, effective and cost-effective mental health care services in a virtual or home setting. 
 We see another potential vector in home based care, particularly for our elderly population. U.S. Medicare spend reached nearly $800 billion in 2019, making up roughly 21% of total annual U.S. health care spend. Recent census data indicates that roughly 61 million Americans were over the age of 65 in 2019, and the 65-and-older age group’s share of the total U.S. adult population reached 23%. Although age isn’t everything, it certainly has a dramatic impact on service distribution as over 80% of that age group suffers from chronic conditions. Furthermore, issues in senior care have been exacerbated by the recent COVID-19 crisis, where 40% of reported deaths from the virus have occurred in nursing homes. This dynamic has resulted in seniors wanting to live independently, and now more than 90% express the intent to age in place. We view patient-centric technology driven care models as providing the vehicle to shifting senior care, as well as broader population health care, back to the home, where consumers are more comfortable and in many cases, safer. Beyond mental health and home based care, there are additional sectors ripe for technology driven change and a patient and consumer centric model to improve care and outcomes, lower cost, and enable science and medical advancements that create a feedback loop which deliver further improvement in care and outcomes and even lower costs. Other areas of interest and focus include data-driven care, population health and various other chronic conditions. 
 Our recent experience building companies such as Livongo and GRAIL have demonstrated that patient-centric health care companies can generate both positive clinical outcomes and outsized shareholder returns. By facilitating early detection of cancer, eliminating the hassle of managing chronic disease, designing the experience around the individual and whole-person care, and building trust with patients, we validated the market need for these revolutionary platforms and realized huge economic successes. However, these are just a few use-cases we envision for the broader health care revolution. There is a myriad of consumer personas that deserve the same excellent care experiences, and there are dozens of infrastructure companies required to support this sectoral shift. 
 Our strategy, based on our core beliefs and values, is to identify a business combination where we can play an impactful role in partnership with a like-minded patient-centric business model that embeds technology driven 
 
18 

  models to transform the patient experience into one that is both convenient and easily accessible, and thereby serving to optimize outcomes for all stakeholders. Instead of improving inflexible systems, we want to reinvent these systems, to bend the cost and quality curve, and to overcome the entrenched resistance to change. We want to empower good ideas and disruptive technologies to improve outcomes for the most important consumer—the patient. We believe that if you create a great user experience of value, you have an open road to building a multi-billion dollar success story like Livongo, Airbnb, or Stripe. 
 For our business combination, we are looking for companies that are aligned with our vision to revolutionize health care, are led by mission-driven CEOs committed to responsible innovation, and have high growth potential in markets with TAM expansion opportunities. We are interested in companies building patient-centric health care models, care delivery approaches that enable the progression toward the home, virtual health care services that increase patient access and affordability, new models to manage risk and pay for care, and algorithms that can drive therapeutic innovation, guide treatment decisions and proactively screen or monitor disease. Using this framework, we are creating RHAC to identify companies that can be transformed into category leaders best positioned in the public markets. We believe we are well placed to help a transformational company, aligned with our philosophy, to the public markets, and then to help it grow, thrive, and succeed in its mission. Our partnership has value far beyond our capital, unlocking the potential of a disruptive business to revolutionize care, supported by our team’s deep industry, operational and product experience, extensive networks, and track records as investors, advisors, executives, and board members. Our alignment with the economic transformation of the industry will make this a vehicle with which the best entrepreneurs will want to work. 
 Business Combination Criteria 
 While we may decide to enter into a business combination with a business that does not meet these criteria, we intend to seek a business combination: 

• | sitting at the intersection between technology, health care and life sciences, including patient-centric, data-driven, cloud-based platforms;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that has the potential to change the health care system to benefit the patient (built with empathy, cuts down costs, and prioritizes personalization and patient outcomes);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | where we can materially impact the value and growth of the company in partnership with management;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | address disease areas that are ripe for disruption due to dismal patient experience (e.g., mental health and well-being, home based care);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | close to our proximal networks of founders, operators, investors, and advisors; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | where we have a differentiated view on the ability of the target to create value as a public company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We anticipate offering the following benefits to our business combination partner: 
 

• | partnership with our management team members who have extensive track records of founding, operating, advising, and investing in market-leading health care, life sciences and technology companies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | access to our network of leading industry executives, entrepreneurs, and investors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increase company presence and visibility with strategic partners, customers, employers, payors, and vendors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | higher engagement with core, relevant, fundamental investors as anchor stockholders than a traditional IPO book-building process would offer;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | lower risk and expedited path to a public listing with flexible structuring;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | infusion of cash and ongoing access to public capital markets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------



19 

  
• | listed public currency for future acquisitions and growth;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | ability for management to retain control and focus on growing the business; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | opportunity to motivate and retain employees using stock-based compensation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial Business Combination 
 Nasdaq rules and our Initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Initial Business Combination and that a majority of our independent directors approve such Initial Business Combination (s). If our Board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our stockholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion nor will they be able to rely on such opinion. 
 We anticipate and aim to complete our Initial Business Combination only if the post-business combination company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or is otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our Initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test; provided that in the event that the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the Initial Business Combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction. The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our Initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our Initial Business Combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an Initial Business Combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. 
 Other Considerations 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an Initial Business Combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with ARCH, General Catalyst, HAAC, or our initial stockholders, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with ARCH, General Catalyst, HAAC, or any of our initial stockholders, officers or directors, we, or a committee of 
 
20 

  independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or accounting firm that such Initial Business Combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 
 Affiliates of ARCH, General Catalyst and members of our Board will directly or indirectly own alignment shares and private placement warrants following the Initial Public Offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our Initial Business Combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers or directors were to be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our Initial Business Combination. 
 We currently do not have any specific business combination under consideration. Our officers and directors have neither individually selected nor considered a target business nor have they had any substantive discussions regarding possible target businesses among themselves or with our underwriter or other advisors. ARCH, and General Catalyst HAAC are continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination, but we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted any prospective target business or had any substantive discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to a business combination transaction with our company. We have not (nor have any of our agents or affiliates) been approached by any candidates (or representative of any candidates) with respect to a possible acquisition transaction with us and we will not consider a business combination with any company that has already been identified to ARCH, General Catalyst HAAC or CPAR as a suitable acquisition candidate for it, unless ARCH, or General Catalyst HAAC, as applicable, in their sole discretion, declines such potential business combination or makes available to us a co-investment opportunity in accordance with ARCH or General Catalyst’s applicable existing and future policies and procedures, as applicable. Additionally, we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, taken any substantive measure, directly or indirectly, to select or locate any suitable acquisition candidate for us, nor have we engaged or retained any agent or other representative to select or locate any such acquisition candidate. 
 Each of ARCH and General Catalyst may manage multiple investment vehicles and raise additional funds and/or successor funds in the future, which may be during the period in which we are seeking our Initial Business Combination. These ARCH and General Catalyst investment entities may be seeking acquisition opportunities and related financing at any time. We may compete with any one or more of them on any given acquisition opportunity. 
 In addition, certain of our founders, officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities, including, without limitation, HAAC, CPAR, investment funds, accounts, co-investment vehicles and other entities managed by affiliates of ARCH or General Catalyst and certain companies in which ARCH, General Catalyst or such entities have invested. As a result, if any of our founders, officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity, which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations (including, without limitation, HAAC, CPAR, any ARCH or General Catalyst funds or other investment vehicles), then, subject to their fiduciary duties under applicable law, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these funds or investment entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. In addition, investment ideas generated within or presented to ARCH, General Catalyst, HAAC, CPAR or our founders may be suitable for both us and a current or future ARCH or General Catalyst fund, portfolio company or other investment entity (including HAAC and CPAR) and, subject to applicable fiduciary duties, will first be directed to such fund, portfolio company or other entity before being directed, if at all, to us. None of ARCH, General Catalyst, HAAC, CPAR, our founders or any members of our Board who serve as an officer or director of HAAC or CPAR or are also employed by ARCH, General Catalyst or its affiliates have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware solely in their capacities as officers or executives of ARCH or General Catalyst, as applicable. 
 
21 

  In addition, our founders, officers and directors, are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. Moreover, our founders, officers and directors have, and will have in the future, time and attention requirements for current and future special purpose acquisition companies investment funds, accounts, co-investment vehicles and other entities managed by ARCH or General Catalyst (including HAAC and CPAR). To the extent any conflict of interest arises between, on the one hand, us and, on the other hand, special purpose acquisition companies investment funds, accounts, co-investment vehicles and other entities managed by ARCH or General Catalyst (including, without limitation, arising as a result of certain of our founders, officers and directors being required to offer acquisition opportunities to such special purpose acquisition companies investment funds, accounts, co-investment vehicles and other entities), ARCH, General Catalyst and its affiliates will resolve such conflicts of interest in their sole discretion in accordance with their then existing fiduciary, contractual and other duties and there can be no assurance that such conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor. 
 Corporate Information 
 We currently maintain our executive offices at 20 University Road, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee we pay to an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 
 We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout Annual Report on Form 10-K as our Initial Business Combination. Our mission is to partner with leading businesses at the intersection of health care, life sciences and technology to redesign health care around the patient. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to the Initial Public Offering. We have not selected any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. We have generated no operating revenues to date, and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our Initial Business Combination. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds 
 
22 

  $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is equal to or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is equal to or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible. 
 Status as a Public Company 
 We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional Initial Public Offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares of Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our shares of Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical Initial Public Offering. The typical Initial Public Offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the Initial Public Offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. 
 Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an Initial Public Offering is always subject to the underwriter’s ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 
 While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed Initial Business Combination, negatively. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying 
 
23 

  with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 
 Financial Position 
 With funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of $550,000,000 (assuming no redemptions), we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 General 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following the Initial Public Offering. We intend to effectuate our Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our Initial Business Combination. We may seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 If our Initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our shares of Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 We have not selected any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions with any business combination target. Additionally, we have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate, to conduct any research or take any measures, directly or indirectly, to locate or contact a target business, other than our officers and directors. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our Initial Business Combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business. 
 We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our Initial Business Combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our Trust Account, or because we 
 
24 

  become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our Initial Business Combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third-party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise. 
 Sources of Target Businesses 
 We have not selected any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. Certain members of our management team are officers or directors of HAAC or CPAR or are employed by ARCH, General Catalyst or their respective affiliates. ARCH, General Catalyst, HAAC and CPAR are continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue, for a business combination, but we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted, or had any discussions, formal or otherwise with, any prospective target business with respect to a business combination transaction with us. 
 We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms, and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since some of these sources will have read the initial public offering final prospectus and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s-length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or their respective affiliates paid by us any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our Initial Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We have agreed to pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an Initial Business Combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-business combination company following our Initial Business Combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an Initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with ARCH, General Catalyst, HAAC, CPAR, our initial stockholders, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with ARCH, General Catalyst, HAAC, CPAR or our initial stockholders or any of our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such Initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 
25 

  Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including HAAC, CPAR and other entities that are affiliates of our initial stockholders, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Delaware law. See “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance—Conflicts of Interest” 
 Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our Initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our Initial Business Combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an Initial Business Combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our Initial Business Combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our Initial Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our Initial Business Combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team 
 Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our Initial Business Combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Initial Business Combination. While it is possible that one or more of 
 
26 

  our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our Initial Business Combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Initial Business Combination. 
 Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. 
 Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, stockholder approval would typically be required for our Initial Business Combination if, for example: 
 

• | we issue common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our common stock then-outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any of our directors, officers or substantial security holder (as defined by the Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in issued and outstanding common stock or voting power of 1% or more (or 5% or more if the related party involved is classified as such solely because such person is a substantial security holder); or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which stockholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 
 

• | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | the risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other time and budget constraints of the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities 
 If we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, 
 
27 

  directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our Initial Business Combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event that our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
 The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the Initial Business Combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the Initial Business Combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a candidate for our Initial Business Combination that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our Initial Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our Initial Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Class A common stock or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 Our initial stockholders, officers, directors and/or their affiliates may identify the stockholders with whom our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders (in the case of shares of Class A common stock) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our Initial Business Combination. To the extent that our initial stockholders, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against our Initial Business Combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our Initial Business Combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the stockholder meeting related to our Initial Business Combination. Our initial stockholders, executive officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will select which stockholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 
 Our initial stockholders, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases would be reported by such person pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.

  Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any alignment shares and public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination. 
Limitations on Redemptions 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed Initial Business Combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target candidate or its owners; (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed Initial Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the Initial Business Combination or redeem any shares in connection with such Initial Business Combination, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking stockholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 5% of our shares of outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. We will conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote unless stockholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with the Nasdaq rules. 
 If we held a stockholder vote to approve our Initial Business Combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------



29 

  In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the Initial Business Combination. 
 If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our Initial Business Combination only if a majority of the common stock, represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, voted at a stockholder meeting are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial stockholders and each member of our management team have agreed to vote their alignment shares and public shares in favor of our Initial Business Combination. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholder’s Alignment Shares, we would need 20,625,001, or 37.5% of the 55,000,000 Public Shares sold in the Initial Public Offering to be voted in favor of an Initial Business Combination in order to have our Initial Business Combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised). Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. In addition, our initial stockholders and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any alignment shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our shares of Class A common stock the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our Initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering (or such later date as approved by holders of a majority of shares of our outstanding common stock that are voted at a meeting to extend such date, voting together as a single class) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our shares of Class A common stock. 
 If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our Initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the Initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Upon the public announcement of our Initial Business Combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our initial stockholders will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of Class A common stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our Initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such Initial Business Combination. 
 Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Stockholder Approval 
 If we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or 
 
30 

  any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our initial stockholders or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our Initial Business Combination. 
 Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 
 Public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/ Withdrawal At Custodian) System (the “DWAC System”), at the holder’s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our Initial Business Combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an Initial Business Combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the 
 
31 

  business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming stockholder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our Initial Business Combination. If our Initial Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we will continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering (or such later date as approved by holders of a majority of shares of our outstanding common stock that are voted at a meeting to extend such date, voting together as a single class). 
 Extension of Time to Complete Business Combination 
 We must complete an Initial Business Combination with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with the Initial Business Combination and that a majority of the independent directors approve such Initial Business Combination(s). However, we will only complete an Initial Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target or otherwise is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 
 After signing a definitive agreement for an Initial Business Combination, we will either (i) seek stockholder approval of the Initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose in connection with which Public Stockholders may seek to redeem their Public Shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the an Initial Business Combination or do not vote at all, for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes, or (ii) provide the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the Initial Business Combination at $10.00 per SAIL and the per share interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (net of permitted withdrawals). As a result, such common stock was recorded at redemption amount and classified as temporary equity, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of the Initial Business Combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete the initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the Initial Business Combination. However, in no event will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon consummation of an Initial Business Combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of our Public Shares and the related business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination. 
 We will only have 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to complete the Initial Business Combination, or March 22, 2023 (or such later date as approved by holders of a majority of shares of the 
 
32 

  outstanding common stock that are voted at a meeting to extend such date, voting together as a single class) (the “Business Combination Period”). If we do not complete an Initial Business Combination within this period of time (and stockholders do not approve an amendment to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend this date), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, of $10.00, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering (or such later date as approved by holders of a majority of shares of our outstanding common stock that are voted at a meeting to extend such date, voting together as a single class) to consummate an Initial Business Combination. If we have not consummated an Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering (or such later date as approved by holders of a majority of shares of our outstanding common stock that are voted at a meeting to extend such date, voting together as a single class), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate an Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering (or such later date as approved by holders of a majority of shares of our outstanding common stock that are voted at a meeting to extend such date, voting together as a single class). Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our Initial Business Combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the Trust Account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter. 
 Our initial stockholders and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any alignment shares they hold if we fail to consummate an Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering, or such later date as described in the preceding paragraph (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame). 
 Our initial stockholders, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our shares of Class A common stock the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our Initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering (or such later date as approved by holders of a majority of shares of our outstanding common stock that are voted at a meeting to extend such date, voting together as a single class) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our shares of Class A common stock, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public 
 
33 

  shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our initial stockholders, any executive officer, director or any other person. 
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $4,500,000 of proceeds held outside the Trust Account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. 
 If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims. 
 Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including, but not limited, to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The underwriters will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations; provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a 
 
34 

  third-party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties, including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our income tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share. 
 We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to $4,500,000 from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our Trust Account received by any such stockholder. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $4,500,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the Trust Account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the Trust Account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $4,500,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the Trust Account would increase by a corresponding amount. 
 Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of the funds in our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering (or such later date as approved by holders of a majority of shares of our outstanding common stock that are voted at a meeting to extend such date, voting together as a single class) may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of the funds in our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our Initial Business Combination 
 
35 

  within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering (or such later date as approved by holders of a majority of shares of our outstanding common stock that are voted at a meeting to extend such date, voting together as a single class), is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering (or such later date as approved by holders of a majority of shares of our outstanding common stock that are voted at a meeting to extend such date, voting together as a single class), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 
 Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a newly organized company established for the purpose of identifying a company to partner with in order to effectuate a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar Initial Business Combination, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective candidates for our Initial Business Combination to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective candidates for our Initial Business Combination. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (except for our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective candidates for our Initial Business Combination or other entities with which we do business (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the Trust Account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of the initial public offering final prospectus against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 
 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be 
 
36 

  viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors will be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 
 Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering (or such later date as approved by holders of a majority of shares of our outstanding common stock that are voted at a meeting to extend such date, voting together as a single class), (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering (or such later date as approved by holders of a majority of shares of our outstanding common stock that are voted at a meeting to extend such date, voting together as a single class) or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre- Initial Business Combination activity or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our Initial Business Combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the Initial Business Combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our Initial Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our Initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an Initial Business Combination. 
Facilities 
 We currently maintain our executive offices at 20 University Road, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee we pay to an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 
Employees 
 We currently have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. The amount of time they will devote in any 
 
37 

  time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our Initial Business Combination. 
 Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 We have registered our SAILSM securities, shares of Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to stockholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our Initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
 We filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our Initial Business Combination. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the 
 
38 

  adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is equal to or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is equal to or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.
