ITEM 1. BUSINESS
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Our Corporate History and Background

As used herein, references to the “Company”, “we”, “our”, “us”, and “Phoenix Rising” refer to Phoenix Rising Companies, a Nevada corporation,and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates.

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 25, 2012, under the name Resort Savers, Inc. On May 28, 2020, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State, changing our name to Phoenix Rising Companies. The name change was effected with the OTC Markets Group, Inc. on March 10, 2021.

A diagram of our corporate structure is as follows:


Change of Management

On February 9, 2018, concurrently with the execution of the Admall Exchange Agreement and the Dusun Termination Agreement, Zhou Gui Bin resigned from his positions as President, CEO, Secretary and Director of the Company, and Zhou Wei resigned from his positions as Treasurer, CFO and Director of the Company. The departing Directors approved, by written consent in lieu of special meeting of the Board of Directors, the appointment of Mr. Ding-Shin “DS” Chang and Mr. Boon Jin “Patrick” Tan as the new Directors of the Company and submitted such appointment for approval and ratification by the Company’s stockholders. The Company’s departing Directors also appointed Mr. Ding-Shin “DS” Chang as the Company’s President and CEO, Mr. Boon Jin “Patrick” Tan as the Company’s Treasurer and CFO, and Mr. Liang-Yu “Jacky” Chang as the Company’s Secretary, all of whom are to serve on an at-will basis until their resignation or removal by the Board of Directors.
Change in Fiscal Year End; Change to Bylaws; Reverse Stock Split; Corporate Name Change

On July 3, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from January 31 to December 31. The Company now operates on a fiscal year ending on December 31. The Company changed its bylaws to reflect the change in fiscal year end.

Contemporaneously with the change in fiscal year end, our Board of Directors approved a reverse one-for-thirty (1-for-30) stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Stock and a change of corporate name from “Resort Savers, Inc.” to “SCGI Group Holding, Inc.” (the “Name Change”). Following these corporate approvals, the management of the Company delayed implementation of the reserve stock split and corporate name change, and management never submitted an Issuer Company-Related Action Notification Form (“Notification Form”) with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) to effect such actions.


4


On July 15, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a reverse one-for-one hundred (1-for-100) stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Stock. The Reverse Split will have no effect on the number of authorized Common Stock of the Company, nor will it affect the authorized or issued and outstanding shares of its Preferred Stock, since the Company has no shares of Preferred Stock issued or outstanding. The Reverse Split will be effective following a review by FINRA, which the Company anticipates will be approximately thirty to sixty days following submission of a Notification Form with FINRA, which occurred on July 23, 2019. Upon effectiveness of the Reverse Split, the Company intends to file a Certificate of Change with the Nevada Secretary of State, pursuant to Nevada Revised Statute (“NRS”) 78.209. The Reverse Split was approved by the Board of Directors and the stockholders of the Company on July 15, 2019. The record date for the Reverse Split is July 30, 2019. For more information on the Reverse Split, please refer to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on July 22, 2019.

On July 15, 2019, the Board of Directors and the stockholders of the Company, each by executing a written consent, approved of an amended and restated articles of incorporation (the “Restated Articles”), which contain the Name Change. The officers of the Company intended to filed the Restated Articles with the Nevada Secretary of State following review of the Notification Form by FINRA. For more information on the Name Change, please refer to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which was filed with the SEC on July 22, 2019.

On August 14, 2019, the Board of Directors and the stockholders of the Company, each by executing a written consent, voted to abandon the Name Change and Restated Articles. However, the Company proceeded with and implemented the Reverse Split. The Company submitted an amended notification to FINRA for abandonment of the Name Change and Restated Articles, and received approval from FINRA for the reverse split. The Reverse Split was effective on September 16, 2019.

On February 9, 2022, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation, increasing its authorized shares of common stock from 1,000,000 shares to 8,000,000 shares.

Our principal administrative offices are located at 641 10th Street, Cedartown, Georgia 30125, and our telephone number is (844) 487-4636. Our website is www.phoenix-cos.com. Information on our website is not part of this filing or otherwise incorporated herein.


Disclosures Related to Our China-Based Operations

Phoenix Holding Companies is a holding company incorporated in Nevada, the United States, with no material operations of its own. We conduct our business through our operating subsidiaries in China. This structure involves unique risks to investors, and you may never directly hold equity interests in the operating entities.

There are significant legal and operational risks and uncertainties associated with having substantially all operations in China, such as the enforcement of laws and changes in the legal, political and economic policies of the Chinese government. Any such changes may take place quickly and with very little notice, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our securities. Moreover, the Chinese government may exert significant oversight and control over the conduct of our business and may intervene in or influence our overseas offerings and foreign investment at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. 

The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. China has not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently enacted laws, rules and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China or may be subject to a significant degree of interpretation by PRC regulatory agencies and courts. In particular, because these laws, rules and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited number of published decisions and the non-precedential nature of these decisions, and because the laws, rules and regulations often give the relevant regulator significant discretion in how to enforce them, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations involve uncertainties and can be inconsistent and unpredictable. Therefore, it is possible that our existing operations may be found not to be in full compliance with relevant laws and regulations in the future. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, and which may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until after the occurrence of the violation. 


5


The PRC government recently initiated a series of regulatory actions and made a number of public statements on the regulation of business operations in China, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using a variable interest entity (“VIE”) structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. We do not believe that our subsidiaries in China are directly subject to these regulatory actions or statements, as we have not carried out any monopolistic behavior, we have never adopted a VIE structure, and our business does not involve any restricted industry or implicate cybersecurity. However, since these statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government are newly published and detailed official guidance and related implementation rules have not been issued or taken effect, uncertainties exist as to how soon the regulatory bodies in China will finalize implementation measures, and the impacts the modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. 

For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—The Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations in China at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted outside China by and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and in the value of our securities. Any actions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted outside China by and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless” on page ___, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Changes in U.S. and Chinese regulations or in relations between the United States and China may adversely impact our business, our operating results, our ability to raise capital and the value of our securities. Any such changes may take place quickly and with very little notice” on page ___ and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws, rules and regulations” on page ___.

The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act

The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the “HFCA Act”), was enacted in December 2020 and may affect our ability to maintain our quotation on the over-the-counter markets. Pursuant to the HFCA Act, if the SEC determines that we are an issuer, or a Commission-Identified Issuer, that has filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspection for the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”), for three consecutive years, the SEC shall prohibit our common stock from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States. Pursuant to the HFCA Act, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report on December 16, 2021 which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong because of a position taken by the authorities in such jurisdictions. The PCAOB’s report identified specific registered public accounting firms which are subject to these determinations; however, our current registered public accounting firm, BF Borgers CPA PC, which is headquartered in the United States of America, is not subject to these determinations.  On May 31, 2022, we were identified by the SEC pursuant to the HCFA Act as a Commission-Identified Issuer. On August 26, 2022, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”), the Ministry of Finance of the PRC, and PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol (the “Protocol”), governing inspections and investigations of audit firms based in China and Hong Kong. Pursuant to the Protocol, the PCAOB has independent discretion to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation and has the unfettered ability to transfer information to the SEC. However, uncertainties still exist whether this new framework will be fully complied with. If the PCAOB continues to be prohibited from conducting complete inspections and investigations of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong, the PCAOB is likely to determine by the end of 2022 that positions taken by authorities in the PRC obstructed its ability to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong completely, then the companies audited by those registered public accounting firms would be subject to a trading prohibition on U.S. markets pursuant to the HFCA Act. As a result, trading in our securities may be prohibited under the HFCA Act if the PCAOB determines our audit work is performed by auditors that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely for three consecutive years thereafter, our securities will be removed from quotation on the over-the-counter markets. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the “AHFCAA”), which, if enacted, would amend the HFCA Act and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. exchange or the over-the-counter markets if its auditor is not subject to the PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three. We plan to identify and engage an independent public accounting firm that satisfies the PCAOB inspection requirements for the audit of our consolidated financial statements, subject to compliance with SEC and other requirements prior to the three-year (or two-year under the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act) deadline of the HFCA Act.

For additional information, see “Risk Factor—Risks Related to Doing Business in China— The audit report included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was prepared by an auditor who is not inspected by the PCAOB and, as such, you are deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Our common stock may be delisted under the HFCA Act if the PCAOB is unable to inspect our auditors for three consecutive years after we are identified by the SEC as a Commission-Identified Issuer, or two consecutive years if the AHFCAA is enacted. The delisting of our securities, or the threat of our securities being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment” on page _____.

Permissions Required from the PRC Authorities for Our Business Operations and Securities Offering

In addition to regular business licenses, we are required to obtain the pollutants discharge permit to operate our business in the PRC. We believe that our PRC operating subsidiaries have obtained all requisite permissions for our operations in all material aspects from relevant Chinese authorities and none of the requisite permissions for our operations in all material aspects have been denied by the Chinese authorities. However, we cannot assure you that our PRC subsidiaries are always able to successfully update or renew the licenses or permits required for the relevant business in a timely manner or that these licenses or permits are sufficient to conduct all of our present or future business. If our PRC subsidiaries (i) do not receive or maintain required permissions or approvals, (ii) inadvertently conclude that such permissions or approvals are not required, or (iii) applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and our PRC subsidiaries are required to obtain such permissions or approvals in the future, we could be subject to fines, legal sanctions or an order to suspend our PRC operating subsidiaries’ business, which may materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of us.

In connection with our previous issuance of securities, under current PRC laws, regulations and regulatory rules, as of the date of this annual report, we believe that we and our PRC subsidiaries, (i) are not required to obtain permissions from the CSRC, (ii) are not required to go through cybersecurity review by the Cyberspace Administration of China (the “CAC”), and (iii) have not received or were denied such requisite permissions by any PRC authority.

However, we cannot guarantee that the regulators will agree with us. As of the date hereof, we have not been involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review made by the CAC, and we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, or sanctions in such respect. However, as these are new regulations, there remains uncertainties as to how they will be interpreted or implemented in the context of an overseas offering.

For additional information, see “Risk Factor—Risks Related to Doing Business in China— The approval of the CSRC or other Chinese regulatory agencies may be required in connection with our future capital-raising activities outside China under Chinese law.” on page ___.

Cash and Asset Flows through Our Organization

Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. As of the date hereof, we have had no transactions that involved the transfer of cash or assets throughout our corporate structure and no transfers, dividends or distributions have been made to investors. Our PRC subsidiaries have not transferred cash or other assets to Phoenix Rising Companies including by way of dividends. Phoenix Rising Companies does not currently plan or anticipate transferring cash or other assets from our operations in the PRC to any non-Chinese entity.

We do not have any cash management policies that dictate how funds are transferred between Phoenix Rising Companies and its subsidiaries. To the extent cash and/or assets in our business in the PRC or in any of our PRC subsidiaries, such funds and/or assets may not be available to fund operations or for other use outside of the PRC due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on the ability of us or our subsidiaries by the PRC government to transfer cash and/or assets.

Summary of Risk Factors Related to China

Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The following is a summary of significant risk factors and uncertainties that may affect our business, which are discussed in more detail below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:

● | The Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations in China at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted outside China by and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and in the value of our securities. Any actions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted outside China by and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Changes in U.S. and Chinese regulations or in relations between the United States and China may adversely impact our business, our operating results, our ability to raise capital and the value of our securities. Any such changes may take place quickly and with very little notice.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws, rules and regulations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Investors may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in China based upon U.S. laws, including the federal securities laws or other foreign laws against us or our management.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The approval of the CSRC or other Chinese regulatory agencies may be required in connection with our future capital-raising activities outside China under Chinese law.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7

Enforceability of Civil Liabilities

A portion of our current operations are conducted in China. One person who is a director and officer of one of our subsidiaries is a national or resident of China. There is uncertainty as to whether the courts of China would:

● | recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | entertain original actions brought in each respective jurisdiction against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under PRC Civil Procedures Law. PRC courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of PRC Civil Procedures Law based either on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other form of reciprocity with the United States that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security or public interest. As a result, it is uncertain whether and on what basis a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States. Under the PRC Civil Procedures Law, foreign shareholders may originate actions based on PRC law against us in the PRC, if they can establish sufficient nexus to the PRC for a PRC court to have jurisdiction, and meet other procedural requirements, including, among others, the plaintiff must have a direct interest in the case, and there must be a concrete claim, a factual basis and a cause for the suit. However, it would be difficult for foreign shareholders to establish sufficient nexus to the PRC by virtue only of holding our shares of common stock.

The officers and directors of our subsidiaries are as follows:

Xing Rui International Seychelles:  Sole director and officer - Ding-Shin “DS” Chang.
Xing Rui International Hong Kong:  Sole director and officer - Ding-Shin “DS” Chang.
Huaxin Changrong Shenzhen:  Sole director and officer - Ding-Shin “DS” Chang.
Tieshan Beijing: Sole director and officer – Wen Cui.

Business Operations.

The Company has engaged in the following business activities, through the listed subsidiary entities:

Worx America, Inc.

From January 2015 through March 2015, the Company, by and through its wholly owned subsidiary, Xing Rui International Investment Holding Group Co., Ltd. (“Xing Rui”), acquired 20,068,750 shares of common stock (representing 20% of the issued and outstanding common stock) of Worx America, Inc. (“Worx”), a private company based in Houston, Texas, in exchange for $1,650,000 cash and 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Borneo Resource Investments Ltd. (“BRNE”) with a value of $350,000. Specifically, on January 28, 2015, the Company paid $350,000 cash in exchange for 5,403,728 common shares of Worx, on March 20, 2015, the Company paid $1,300,000 cash and transferred 1,000,000 shares of common stock of BRNE in exchange for 14,665,022 common shares of Worx. The Company accounted for this investment using the equity method, with an initial cost of $2,000,000.

Worx designed automated solutions for industrial, environmental and energy industries to improve efficiency and systems output. The Worx automated robotic tank cleaning system was intended to reduce tank cleaning time, reduce or eliminate the need for personnel to enter tanks, and may reduce the volume of solvents used to clean a tank.

On June 6, 2016, Worx sold all of its assets (“Asset Sale”), including, but not limited to, its technologies and intellectual property, to Bay WorxRail, LLC (“Bay WorxRail”) for $1,000,000 (“Purchase Price”), subject to a holdback of $250,000 of the Purchase Price, pursuant to the terms set forth in that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated June 6, 2016, among Worx, Bay WorxRail, and Michael Zilai, as majority stockholder of Worx. The Company reviewed Worx’s financial condition at July 31, 2016 and concluded that as a result of the Asset Sale there is a 100% impairment loss related to the Company’s investment in Worx, and recorded an impairment loss of $1,907,308, for the year ended January 31, 2017. At present, the Company’s carrying value of its Worx investment is $0.

Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Co. Ltd.

On October 1, 2015, the Company issued 3,033,926 shares of its Common Stock to Xu Xiao Yun in exchange for sixty percent (60%) of Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Co. Ltd., a PRC corporation (“Amuli”). The equity of Amuli that was transferred by Xu Xiao Yun was held by Huaxin Changrong (Shenzhen) Technology Service Co., Ltd. (“Huaxin”), which was formed by Xing Rui for the purpose of holding the equity of Amuli and other PRC subsidiaries. The purchase price was valued $2,400,000.

On November 19, 2018, the Company disposed of its partial ownership interest in Amuli by causing Huaxin and Amuli to enter into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Amuli Disposition Agreement”) with Ms. An Wenhui, a citizen of the PRC and minority shareholder of Amuli (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, Huaxin sold its sixty percent (60%) Amuli equity stake (the “Amuli Shares”) to the Purchaser (the “Amuli Disposition”). Pursuant to the Amuli Disposition Agreement, in exchange for the Amuli Shares, the Purchaser paid to Huaxin a cash price of $1 or the equivalent thereof in Chinese Yuan (the “Purchase Price”). Our Board of Directors approved the Amuli Disposition Agreement, the Amuli Disposition and the Purchase Price, because among other reasons the Board of Directors believed that Amuli would not produce significant future income or cash flow. The Amuli Disposition Agreement contains substantially fewer representations and warranties in comparison to other agreements entered into by the Company and its subsidiaries. Additionally, the closing of the Amuli Disposition occurred contemporaneously with the signing of the Amuli Disposition Agreement, which resulted in little or no covenants or closing conditions imposed on the parties. As a result, Amuli is no longer a partially-owned subsidiary of the Company.

Beijing Yandong Tieshan Oil Products Co., Ltd.

On January 29, 2016, the Company entered into an exchange agreement (the “Tieshan Oil Exchange Agreement”) with Mr. Yang Baojin (“Mr. Yang”), a citizen of the PRC, and the Company’s subsidiary Huaxin. Mr. Yang was the president and majority owner of Beijing Yandong Tieshan Oil Products Co., Ltd. (“Tieshan Oil”). Pursuant to the Tieshan Oil Exchange Agreement, the Company issued 4,800,000 shares of its Common Stock to Mr. Yang, who delivered to Huaxin an ownership interest in Tieshan Oil such that Huaxin at the time of closing owned 51% of all ownership interests in Tieshan Oil (the “Tieshan Oil Exchange”). The Company held 1,200,000 shares of its Common Stock in escrow (the “Escrow Shares”) to issue to Mr. Yang twelve months following the closing of the Tieshan Oil Exchange, in connection with the successful performance of certain covenants by Mr. Yang. The Company did not issue the Escrow Shares to Mr. Yang in connection with the Tieshan Oil Exchange.

On May 16, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Tieshan Oil by entering into a second share exchange agreement (the “Second Tieshan Oil Exchange Agreement”) with Mr. Yang. Pursuant to the Second Tieshan Oil Exchange Agreement, the Company, through Huaxin, agreed to acquire the remaining 49% of Tieshan Oil held by Mr. Yang, in exchange for the issuance to Mr. Yang of 16,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Tieshan Oil Acquisition”). The Tieshan Oil Acquisition closed simultaneously with the execution of the Second Tieshan Oil Exchange Agreement.

Apart from the Tieshan Oil Acquisition, neither the Company nor Huaxin has a material relationship with either Mr. Yang or Tieshan Oil.

A description of the products, services, principal market and distribution methods of Tieshan Oil can be found within this Part I, Item 2 under the heading “Principal Products, Services and Their Markets.”

Abandonment of Plans to Acquire Dusun Eco Resort (2005) Sdn. Bhd.

On December 7, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Dusun Exchange Agreement”) with Dusun Eco Resort (2005) Sdn. Bhd., a limited liability company registered under the laws of Malaysia (“Dusun Eco”), and the shareholders of Dusun Eco (the “Dusun Sellers”), by which the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding stock of Dusun Eco in exchange for the issuance of 400,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. After further review of the due diligence materials related to the Exchange, our Board of Directors felt that it was in the Company’s best interest to terminate the Dusun Exchange Agreement. On February 9, 2018, the Company, Dusun Eco and the Dusun Sellers entered into a Termination of Share Exchange Agreement (the “Dusun Termination Agreement”), by which the Company, Dusun Eco and the Dusun Sellers agreed to terminate the Dusun Exchange Agreement with no legal consequence to any of the parties to the Dusun Exchange Agreement.

Admall Sdn. Bhd.

On February 9, 2018, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Admall Exchange Agreement”) with Admall Sdn. Bhd., a limited liability company incorporated in Malaysia (“Admall”), and each of Admall’s shareholders (collectively, the “Admall Sellers”), pursuant to which the Company acquired from the Admall Sellers all outstanding equity interests of Admall in exchange for 400,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company (the “Admall Acquisition”). On May 16, 2018, the Company closed the Admall Acquisition.

Concurrently with the execution of the Admall Exchange Agreement, our Board of Directors appointed Mr. Boon Jin “Patrick” Tan to be the treasurer, CFO and Director of the Company. Mr. Tan is the founder and director of Admall. Apart from the appointment of Mr. Tan as Director and officer of the Company, and the transactions pursuant to the Admall Exchange Agreement, the Company did not have a prior material relationship with Admall or any of the Admall Sellers.

A description of the products, services, principal market and distribution methods of Admall can be found within this Part I, Item 2 under the heading “Principal Products, Services and Their Markets.”

Beijing Yandong Tieshan Oil Products Co., Ltd.

Tieshan Oil acquires a variety of chemical products and compounds that are extracted and processed from crude oil and hydrocarbons. Tieshan Oil acts as an intermediary broker of methyl tert-butyl ether, mineral oil, paraffin oil, petrolatum liquids, alcohol based liquid fuel, trimethylpentane, pentane foamer, natural gasoline, xylene dimethylbenzene, aromatics solvent, and other chemical products and compounds. It identifies sources of supply and purchasers of these chemical products and compounds, and Tieshan Oil principally engages in the trading of these oil, gas and lubricant products within the PRC. Since it’s incorporation, Tieshan Oil has had a number of clients for these brokered products, including two gasoline operators in China, YanDongPetrol Group and YanDon Hao Teng. All of its clients are licensed gasoline operators. While this is a dynamic market, subject to fluctuations and unexpected changes brought on by a variety of political and market matters, Tieshan Oil has successfully managed the impact of these factors and remains an important part of the oil refining industry in Beijing, PRC.

We also continue to actively seek additional global investment opportunities in emerging companies with products that have potential for expanding regional and international sales and revenues.

Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; Our Position in the Industry

In addition to the operating entities and businesses described above, we are actively involved in the acquisition of businesses which we believe will generate cash within an acceptable time horizon, and we primarily use our capital stock as consideration in such acquisitions. We face many competitors in the strategic investment and acquisition sector, including private equity funds, sovereign wealth and pension funds, corporate conglomerates, single family offices and multi-family offices, asset management firms, corporate acquirors which are strategically positioned in industries competitive with ours, and other small-cap public companies which primarily use equity securities to finance investments and acquisitions. In the latter category, barriers to entry are extremely low, and we face intense competition to source investment targets and to close investments. Our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do, including sufficient cash to pay consideration for acquisitions. There are no assurances that our efforts to compete in the marketplace will be successful or that we will continue to be able to compete with other funds, companies or other sources of capital to secure competitive acquisition targets and consummate future transactions.

10

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchise Restrictions and Contractual Obligations & Concessions

We rely on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product designs and marks.
Compliance with Government Regulation

We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the construction and operation of any facility in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that government regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business, however, any government regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business and operating results.
Research and Development Activities and Costs

We have not incurred any research and development costs for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021.

Employees

Including our subsidiaries, we have 20 full-time employees and we do not anticipate hiring more employees in the near future. 

Description of Properties

Our executive offices are located at 641 10th Street, Cedartown, Georgia 30125, and our telephone number is (844) 487-4636. We do not own any real estate or other physical properties.

Bankruptcy or Similar Proceedings

We have never been subject to bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceeding.
