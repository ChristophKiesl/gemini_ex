ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a biotechnology company focused on designing, developing and commercializing innovative therapies and proprietary medical approaches to stimulate and guide an anti-tumor immune response for the treatment of cancer. Our core platform technology, ImmunoPulse®, is a drug-device therapeutic modality comprised of a proprietary intratumoral electroporation delivery device. The ImmunoPulse® platform is designed to deliver DNA-encoded drugs directly into a solid tumor and promote an inflammatory response against cancer. The ImmunoPulse® device can be adapted to treat different tumor types, and consists of an electrical pulse generator, a reusable handle and disposable applicators. Our lead product candidate, ImmunoPulse® IL-12, uses our electroporation device to deliver a DNA-encoded interleukin-12, or IL-12, called tavokinogene telseplasmid, or tavo, with the aim of reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the tumor and engendering a systemic anti-tumor response against untreated tumors in other parts of the body.
 
Our current focus is to pursue our registration-directed study of ImmunoPulse® IL-12 in combination with an approved therapy for melanoma in patients who have shown resistance to or relapse from certain other cancer therapies, which we refer to as the PISCES study. Most of our present activities are directed toward advancing the PISCES study. We also intend to continue to pursue other ongoing or potential new trials and studies related to ImmunoPulse® IL-12, all with the goal of obtaining requisite regulatory approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and comparable regulators in certain other jurisdictions to market and sell this product candidate.
 
In addition, we are developing our next-generation electroporation devices, including advancements toward prototypes, pursuing discovery research to identify other product candidates that, like IL-12, can be encoded into DNA, delivered intratumorally using electroporation and used to reverse the immunosuppressive mechanisms of a tumor, and aiming to expand our ImmunoPulse® pipeline beyond the delivery of plasmid-DNA encoding for cytokines to include other molecules that may be critical to key pathways associated with tumor immune subversion.
 
Cancer Immunotherapy Treatments: Background
 
Many traditional modalities for treating cancer have limited clinical efficacy and are frequently associated with significant negative side effects. Immunotherapy, a relatively new therapeutic modality that has received significant attention in recent years, focuses on modulating the immune system to treat cancer rather than directly killing the cancer cells. Systemic delivery of immune-modulating proteins, such as interleukin-2, or IL-2, and IL-12, has shown early indications of efficacy, but with significant mechanism-based toxicity.
 
Recent attention has also focused on the development of monoclonal antibody drugs, which target critical “immune checkpoint” proteins and augment anti-tumor immunity. Therapies using monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4), anti-PD-1 (program cell-death-1) and anti-PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand-1), are being developed for the treatment of several cancers and have been approved for the treatment of some cancers, including metastatic melanoma and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Although these new immuno-oncology agents have shown clinical benefit for patients with late-stage cancer across multiple tumor types, only a small subset of the overall patient population responds to these therapies. Certain tumors are able to evade the immune system. We believe that when tumors do not have any immune cells inside (immune desert) or surrounding the tumor (immune excluded), immune checkpoint therapies are less effective or ineffective. These tumors are sometimes referred to as “cold” tumors.
 
We believe that if we can convert an inactive, or “cold,” tumor with a low frequency of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs, that limit the anti-tumor response and remove the interferon signature, into an active, or “hot,” tumor that can activate the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1, then we can increase the subset of patients who respond to these therapies. We believe our ImmunoPulse® IL-12 platform addresses this objective, as it has the potential to reshape the tumor microenvironment in patients with an immunologically cold tumor into a highly-inflamed tumor with a fully engaged anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 axis. The immunological components that enable this conversion relates to the intratumoral delivery of tavo, which increases the density of TILs, and in the presence of an anti-PD-1 antibody, a disabling of adaptive resistance and maximizing the cytotoxicity. We believe intratumoral tavo can reshape the tumor through innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, which result in a brisk infiltration of TILs in a previously cold tumor.

We believe there is a significant unmet medical need for patients who may not respond well to these therapies on their own. In particular, for patients who have “cold” tumors and would be unlikely to respond to an immune checkpoint therapy alone, our focus is to develop a therapeutic that has the ability to directly modulate the microenvironment of the tumor by stimulating a local immune reaction through the intratumroral delivery of IL-12 or other immune-modulating molecules. We believe this would enable important immune cells to enter into the tumor and, in essence, turn the tumor “hot.” In doing so, we believe intratumoral delivery of immune-modulating molecules, such as IL-12, could be used as a monotherapy, and importantly, could provide a strong biological rationale for treatment in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4.
 
Our Lead Product Candidate: ImmunoPulse® IL-12
 
Our lead product candidate, ImmunoPulse® IL-12, is a drug-device combination. The drug consists of a plasmid construct called tavo, which encodes IL-12, which is delivered into a tumor using our proprietary electroporation device. A Phase I clinical trial in metastatic melanoma using electroporation to deliver plasmid-DNA encoding for IL-12 was completed in 2008. The data from this trial indicated that the in vivo gene transfer of IL-12 DNA using electroporation in metastatic melanoma was well-tolerated. In addition, anti-tumor activity was observed after a single cycle of treatment, including two complete responses. Importantly, regression in distant, non-injected/non-electroporated lesions was also observed, suggesting that local treatment with ImmunoPulse® IL-12 may lead to a systemic anti-tumor immune response.
 
In February 2017, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for ImmunoPulse® IL-12. The Fast Track program was established to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. Drugs that receive this designation benefit from more frequent communications and meetings with the FDA to review the drug’s development plan, including the design of proposed clinical trials and the extent of data needed for approval. Fast Track designated drugs may also qualify for expedited FDA review and a rolling Biologics License Application, or BLA, review, if certain criteria are met.
 
Clinical Programs
 
All of our ongoing and planned clinical programs relate to our lead product candidate, ImmunoPulse® IL-12. Our current primary focus is to pursue our planned Phase II registration-directed study of ImmunoPulse® IL-12 in combination with Merck & Co., Inc.’s, or Merck’s, approved anti-PD-1 antibody KEYTRUDA® in patients with advanced, metastatic (stage 3-4) melanoma who have shown resistance to or relapse from an anti-PD-1 therapy (OMS-I103). We refer to this study as PISCES.
 
In addition, we have two ongoing clinical trials related to ImmunoPulse® IL-12, although we are not currently actively pursuing these trials: A pilot trial of ImmunoPulse® IL-12 monotherapy in patients with triple negative breast cancer (OMS-I140); a Phase II investigator-sponsored trial with ImmunoPulse® IL-12 plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced, metastatic melanoma (OMS-I102); and a Phase II trial of ImmunoPulse® IL-12 as a monotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma (OMS-I100).
 
OMS-I103: The PISCES Study: An Open-Label Phase II Trial of Intratumoral pIL-12 plus Electroporation in Combination with Intravenous Pembrolizumab in Patients with Stage 3-4 Melanoma who are Progressing on either Pembrolizumab or Nivolumab Treatment
 
Melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer with rapidly rising incidences both in the U.S. and internationally. The National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program estimates that over 75,000 new melanoma cases were diagnosed in 2016, representing 4.5% of all new cancer cases in the U.S. Overall, the five-year survival rate for melanoma, regardless of disease stage, is over 90%; however, for patients who present with metastatic disease and receive systemic treatment, the five-year survival rate is considerably lower at less than 18%. Despite recent advances in therapy, advanced metastatic melanoma continues to present significant morbidity and mortality.

The PISCES study is a Phase II, 2-stage, open-label, single-arm, multi-center study of ImmunoPulse® IL-12 in combination with an intravenous anti-PD-1 antibody, Merck’s KEYTRUDA®, in patients with histological diagnosis of melanoma with progressive locally advanced or metastatic disease defined as stage 3 or 4.
 
Patients in the study must be refractory to certain anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, namely pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) or nivolumab, as either monotherapy or in combination with other approved checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapies according to their approved label, or relapsed as documented disease progression within 24 weeks of the last dose of anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies. The primary endpoint of the study is to assess efficacy over 24 weeks of intratumoral pIL-12-EP in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who previously have progressed on certain approved anti-PD-1 antibodies (either as monotherapy or in combination with other approved checkpoint inhibitors).
 
In May 2017, we submitted to the FDA an investigational new drug application, or IND, for the PISCES study, which, in general, must become accepted and effective before any human clinical trials may begin in the United States. Additionally, in May 2017, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with a subsidiary of Merck in connection with the PISCES study, in which we have agreed to sponsor and fund the study and Merck has agreed to manufacture and supply KEYTRUDA® for use in the study. The PISCES study opened for enrollment in October 2017.
 
OMS-I140: Biomarker-Focused Pilot Study of ImmunoPulse® IL-12 in Patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer
 
Worldwide, approximately 170,000 new cases of triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC, are diagnosed each year, accounting for approximately 15% of all breast cancer. TNBC frequently affects younger women (less than 40 years old) and is characterized by higher relapse rates than estrogen receptor positive breast cancers. TNBC is also associated with an increased risk of recurrence, both locally and in distant sites including the lungs and brain. Advanced TNBC remains a significant area of unmet medical need and there is no established standard-of-care. Treatment generally includes chemotherapy, with or without radiation and/or surgery, but no treatment regimen has demonstrated clear superiority.
 
In January 2017, we amended the clinical protocol for our biomarker-focused pilot study of ImmunoPulse® IL-12 in patients with TNBC to improve the enrollment rate, as it had been slow to enroll, and in September 2017, we enrolled half the patients needed for the study. The study is now open for enrollment and is ongoing. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the potential of ImmunoPulse® IL-12 to promote a pro-inflammatory molecular and histological signature, and the secondary objectives include the evaluation of safety and tolerability; evaluation of local ablation effect (% of necrosis) and description of other evidence of anti-tumor activity. The study is being conducted at Stanford University and is designed to assess whether ImmunoPulse® IL-12 increases TNBC tumor immunogenicity by driving a pro-inflammatory cascade that leads to increases in cytotoxic TILs. The presence and number of TILs is thought to be a key requirement for promoting the anti-tumor activity of monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-PD-1. By driving cytotoxic immune cells into the tumor, ImmunoPulse® IL-12 could be used in combination with checkpoint blockade therapies, which have reported some, but limited, activity in TNBC.
 
OMS-I102: An Open-Label Phase II Trial of ImmunoPulse® IL-12 plus Pembrolizumab in Patients with Advanced, Metastatic Melanoma
 
In August 2015, we enrolled the first patient in our Phase II investigator-sponsored clinical trial led by the clinicians at the University of California, San Francisco, or UCSF. The primary endpoint of this study is to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of the combination of intratumoral pIL-12 by electroporation and Merck’s KEYTRUDA® in patients with melanoma who are progressing or have progressed on anti-PD-1 therapy. The primary endpoint of the study is the best overall response rate of the combination regimen in patients whose tumors are characterized by low numbers of TILs. Recent data suggest that patients whose tumors are not associated with TILs or CD8+ T-cells at the tumor margin are unlikely to respond to anti-PD-1 therapies such as KEYTRUDA®, while those who are CTLA-4 and PD-L1 positive and have increased TILs are more likely to have a clinical benefit. Therefore, therapies that promote TIL generation and PD-L1 positivity may play an important role in augmenting the clinical efficacy of the anti-PD1/PD-L1 agents.

This hypothesis is being tested in this trial by enrolling a low-TIL metastatic melanoma patient population. Initial data was presented in February 2017 and the trial stopped enrolling patients in September 2017. The overall response rate in the 22-patient population was 43% at week 24 (best overall response rate was 48%), with one significant adverse Grade-3 event and one Grade-2 event, both of which were resolved with antibiotics or over-the-counter medicines. Based on these results, we believe the combination therapy studied in the trial was well-tolerated. Ongoing analysis of days to best overall response, duration of response and progression free survival are underway as the existing patients are followed on a long-term basis.
 
OMS-I100: An Open-Label Phase II Trial of ImmunoPulse® IL-12 Monotherapy in Patients with Metastatic Melanoma
 
On December 5, 2014, we released top-line six-month data from a Phase II repeat dose trial of tavo in patients with stage 3 and 4 metastatic melanoma. In this study, which was conducted at UCSF, 30 patients with stage 3 and 4 melanoma received up to four cycles of tavo delivered by electroporation on days one, five and eight of each 12-week cycle. Of the 29 patients in the study who were evaluable, an objective response rate of 31% (9/29) was observed, with 14% (4/29) of patients having a complete response and 17% (5/29) of patients having a partial response. Regression of distant lesions was seen in 50% (13/26) of patients with evaluable non-injected, non-electroporated lesions. Clinical endpoints included objective response rate, local and distant lesion regression, duration of response, overall survival and safety. We believe the results of this study demonstrated that multiple treatment cycles of ImmunoPulse® IL-12 were well-tolerated, with no treatment-limiting toxicities. The majority of adverse events were localized to the treatment site and were Grade-1 or -2 in severity; however, five patients experienced at least one serious adverse event, four of which were not related to study treatment and one of which was assessed as definitely related to the combination of pIL-12 + electroporation but unlikely to be related to the individual components of the study treatment. No adverse events led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment, and no adverse events resulted in death.
 
In order to continue to acquire clinical and immune correlational data on melanoma patients treated with ImmunoPulse® IL-12, the protocol of the OMS-I100 study was amended in February 2014 to enroll up to 30 patients. Enrollment in OMS-I100 Addendum was completed in March 2016, the data base is locked and the clinical study report is pending.
 
Following participation in this trial, some patients participated in a separate study in which they received an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Long-term, follow-up data regarding these patients suggest that ImmunoPulse® IL-12 may prime and enhance response rates to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Of the 29 patients who completed ImmunoPulse® IL-12, 14 subsequently received an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Overall, five of these 14 patients (36%) experienced a complete response and four patients experienced a partial response (29%), for an overall response rate of 65%. Two patients experienced stable disease (14%) and three patients experienced progressive disease (21%). We believe this retrospective sequential data could suggest combinatorial potential of an immune-priming effect with ImmunoPulse® IL-12 prior to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.
 
Other Trials and Studies
 
In addition to the trials and studies described above, we have also pursued and closed Phase II clinical trials in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, although we are no longer pursuing any of these clinical programs.

Our ImmunoPulse® Platform
 
The effectiveness of many drugs and DNA-based therapeutics is dependent upon their crossing the cell membrane. In the 1970s, it was discovered that the brief application of high-intensity, pulsed electric fields to the cell resulted in a temporary and reversible increase in the permeability of the cell membrane, a mechanism known as “electroporation.”
 
The transient, reversible nature of the electrical permeabilization of cell membranes and the resulting increase in intracellular delivery of therapeutic agents is the underlying basis of our ImmunoPulse® therapeutic approach. Our electroporation delivery system consists of an electrical pulse generator, a reusable applicator handle and disposable applicators. While the extent of membrane permeabilization depends on various electrical, physical, chemical, and biological parameters, research with electroporation delivery has demonstrated an improvement in cellular uptake of chemical molecules such as chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., bleomycin and cisplatin), and nucleic acids (e.g., DNA and RNA).
 
Multiple viral and non-viral delivery modalities have been developed to deliver nucleic acids into cells, however, many of these methods have faced challenges related to the safe and efficient expression of the DNA-encoded biologic into the intended target cells. For example, viral mediated delivery technologies appear to be efficient at transfecting cells, but they have suffered from significant safety issues related to the immunogenicity of the viral vector, shedding of the virus, and potential integration of the viral DNA into the host genome. Other non-viral delivery methods have employed the use of nanotechnology to coat the DNA with fat molecules, called lipids. Although these lipid nanoparticle technologies have been used extensively in the clinic to deliver DNA-encoded biologic agents, few particles have been developed with the ability to specifically target cancer cells; instead, many of these particles naturally target the liver, which can lead to potential liver toxicities.
 
Like viral vectors and lipid nanoparticle technologies, electroporation has been used extensively in the clinic to deliver multiple therapeutic agents, including DNA. However, unlike these other technologies, electroporation has not seen the same safety concerns. In fact, the use of electroporation to deliver bleomycin intratumorally has been approved for use in Europe for cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma, and has been accepted across many European countries, including the United Kingdom.
 
Our ImmunoPulse® platform employs an electroporation system designed to create favorable conditions to deliver plasmid DNA encoding immunotherapeutic cytokines directly into cells of the tumor microenvironment. The cytokine-encoding plasmid is first injected into the tumor. A needle-electrode array then delivers the electrical pulses produced in the pulse generator. In addition, we are continuing to advance the field of electroporation by developing our tissue-based real-time adaptive control electroporation, or TRACE, technology. The TRACE technology uses electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, or EIS, to continuously evaluate the electrical properties of the tissue. By doing so, TRACE has the ability to modulate the electric field in real-time, thus optimizing the electroporation conditions and improving the transfection of the DNA into the cells.
 
Our lead product candidate, ImmunoPulse® IL-12, consists of a plasmid construct encoding the proinflammatory cytokine IL-12 that is delivered into the tumor through in vivo electroporation using our ImmunoPulse® technology. We are also researching other DNA-encoded, immunologically-active molecules, with an aim of developing additional immunotherapeutic drugs that, when delivered through electroporation using our ImmunoPulse® platform, may be capable of breaking the immune system’s tolerance to cancer.
 
Commercialization
 
Strategy
 
Our primary focus is to continue our clinical development strategy for ImmunoPulse® IL-12, including our currently planned and ongoing Phase II clinical trials discussed under “Clinical Programs” above and potentially other Phase II or subsequent trials we may pursue in the future, which may include trials focused on cancers that have demonstrated a response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint therapies, such as metastatic melanoma.

-


As a part of our commercialization strategy, we also regularly investigate and evaluate potential collaboration opportunities, to identify rational combinations with existing and emerging monoclonal antibody therapies and other drugs. For instance, we may seek to collaborate with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies or government agencies to provide us with access to complementary technologies and/or greater resources. In addition, we may seek to expand the applications of our technologies through strategic collaborations or other opportunities, such as in-licensing or strategic acquisitions, and we may seek to out-license our intellectual property to other companies to leverage our technologies for applications that we may not choose to internally and independently development.
 
Manufacturing and Supply
 
Currently, we assemble certain components of our electroporation system, which is our proprietary delivery mechanism for our ImmunoPulse IL-12® product candidate, and we utilize the services of contract manufacturers to manufacture the remaining components of these systems and for the manufacture, testing and storage of all of our supply of our plasmid product candidate for clinical trials or other studies. The manufacture of our systems and product supplies requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the use of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls, and we do not own and have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial manufacturing capabilities. We expect to increase our reliance on third-party manufacturers if and when we commercialize any of our product candidates and systems.
 
We rely upon a small number of suppliers and manufacturers for our clinical activities, including distributors such as Cryosite, Sherpa, as well as manufacturers such as Richter Helm, VGXI and SGS, which collectively account for 100% of clinical materials; and Minnetronix, which accounts for 50% of electroporation systems support and materials. We believe there are alternate sources of raw material supply and finished goods manufacturing to satisfy our requirements, although transitioning to other vendors, if necessary, could result in significant delay or material additional costs. In addition, for combination trials, we typically rely exclusively on one supplier of the non-company-owned product used in the trial, such as our reliance upon Merck for the supply of KEYTRUDA® in the PISCES study.
 
We are certified by all appropriate standards and authorities for the limited assembly and manufacture activities we conduct, and we and have established an audited quality management system for these activities. In addition, all contract manufacturers that we use must comply with various requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection programs. See “Regulation” below for more information.
 
Competition
 
The biotechnology industry is intensely competitive. This competitive environment stimulates an ongoing and extensive search for technological innovation and necessitates effective and targeted marketing strategies to communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of products to healthcare professionals in private practice and group practices and payors in managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, and Medicare and Medicaid services.
 
We face competition from a number of sources, including large pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. We compete against all other developers of cancer treatments, including other immunotherapy treatments as well as other types of treatments for the cancer indications on which we are focused. In particular, a number of companies, some of which are large, well-established pharmaceutical companies, have recently announced development strategies similar to our current focus on our PISCES study, namely the combination of IL-12 and a checkpoint inhibitor to improve response rates in patients who are refractory or who have relapsed on anti-PD-1 therapies either alone or in combination with other therapies, and we view these companies as our most relevant current competitors. These companies include, among others, Bristol Myers-Squibb, Iovance Therapeutics, Syndax, Dynavax Technologies and Idera Pharmaceuticals. In addition, we also compete with other early-stage biotechnology companies for funding and support from healthcare and other investors and potential collaboration relationships with larger pharmaceutical or other companies, as well as for personnel with expertise in our industry. We are smaller, less experienced and less well-funded than many of our competitors, and we have a shorter and less proven operating history and a less recognizable and established brand name than many of our competitors. In addition, some of our competitors have commercially available products, which provide them with operating revenue and other competitive advantages. Furthermore, recent trends in the biotechnology industry are for large drug companies to acquire smaller outfits and consolidate into a smaller number of very large entities, which further concentrates financial, technical and market strength and increases competitive pressure in the industry.

Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their product candidates more rapidly than we can or may obtain more robust patent protection or other intellectual property rights to protect their product candidates and technologies, which could limit or prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates. If we are able to obtain regulatory approval of one or more of our product candidates, we will face competition from approved products or products under development by larger companies that may address our targeted indications. If we directly compete with these very large entities for the same markets and/or customers, their greater resources, brand recognition, sales and marketing experience and financial strength could prevent us from capturing a share of these markets or customers. Our competitors may also develop products that are more effective, more useful, better tolerated, subject to fewer or less severe side effects, more widely prescribed, less costly or more widely accepted for other reasons than any of our products that obtain regulatory approvals, and our competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing, distributing and otherwise marketing their products.
 
We expect our product candidates, if approved and commercialized, to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy and safety, time to market, price, coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, extent of adverse side effects and convenience of treatment procedures. We may not be able to effectively compete in any of these areas. Presently, we compete with other biotechnology companies for funding and support on the basis of our technology platforms and the potential value of our product candidates based on the factors described above.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe our success and ability to compete depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and technologies, including obtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection of our product candidates and their respective components and underlying technologies, including devices, formulations, manufacturing methods and methods of treatment, and appropriately safeguarding unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how. As of October 2017, we owned 28 U.S. patents and several patents in foreign jurisdictions, and we are currently prosecuting several pending patent applications in various jurisdictions. In addition, we have licensed intellectual property rights that allow us to use certain electroporation technology to deliver DNA-based cytokines as an immunotherapy, as well as catheter-based delivery devices. From these in-licensed portfolios, we have access to five issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, and several pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. We expect to continue to file additional patent applications, if and when appropriate, as our research and development efforts continue. The majority of the patents in our portfolio, including owned and in-licensed patents and fundamental patents directed toward our proprietary technology, expire between 2017 and 2030. Importantly, although we have previously obtained patent protection, through an asset purchase agreement, covering our ImmunoPulse® clinical device, the primary U.S. patent providing such protection expired in September 2017 and our international patent providing such protection will expire in 2018.
 
In addition, we have entered into a cross-license agreement for certain electroporation technology with Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Inovio, including our patent protection for our ImmunoPulse® clinical device (some of which, as noted above, has recently expired or will expire in 2018). Under the terms of the agreement, Inovio has granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain of its electroporation patents, and in exchange, we have granted to Inovio an exclusive license to certain of our purchased technology in a limited field of use.
 
Research and Development
 
We recognized $12.0 million and $14.7 million in research and development expenses in our fiscal years ended July 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. From our inception through July 31, 2017, we have incurred an aggregate of approximately $51.7 million of research and development expenses, the significant majority of which relate to our development of immuno-oncology therapeutic product candidates with the use of an electroporation device.

Regulation
 
Commercialization Approval for our Product Candidates
 
Biotechnology companies are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation relating to the ability to market and sell any therapeutic or medical device. In the United States, these regulations are principally administered by the FDA and, to a lesser extent, by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, and comparable state government agencies, and outside the United States, these regulations are typically administered by various regulatory agencies comparable to the FDA in foreign countries where products or product candidates are researched, tested, manufactured and/or marketed.
United States
 
General
 
In the United States, the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, Controlled Substances Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, many of which are administered and enforced by the FDA, govern or influence, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, record-keeping, approval, labeling, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, import and export of product candidates such as ours. Under these regulations, we and our contract manufacturers may become subject to periodic inspection of our facilities, quality control and other procedures, and operations and/or the testing of our product candidates by the FDA, DEA and other authorities during and after the approval process for a product candidate, to confirm compliance with all applicable regulations, including current good manufacturing practices and other applicable requirements.
 
Possible penalties or other consequences for failure to comply with these regulatory requirements include, among others, observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could force us to modify our clinical programs or other activities; clinical holds on our ongoing clinical programs; adverse publicity from the FDA or others; the FDA’s suspension of its review of pending applications; fines; product recalls or seizures; total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution; labeling changes; withdrawal of previously granted product approvals; enforcement actions; injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution. Any such sanctions, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 
Approval Process
 
Before any new drug, device or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug or biologic, can be marketed in the United States, FDA approval is required. The process required by the FDA before a product may be marketed in the United States generally involves, among other things:

● | completion of non-clinical testing; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | completion of pre-clinical chemistry, manufacturing, and control testing, commonly known as CMC; 
● | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must be accepted and effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; 
● | performance of adequate human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for each intended use; 
● | for a medical device, submission to the FDA of a premarket approval application or 510(k) premarket notification, which the FDA must review and approve; and 
● | for a therapeutic, submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, or biologic license application, or BLA, which the FDA must review and approve. 


11
--


The pre-clinical and clinical testing and approval process can take many years and requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of approval, if any, is highly uncertain. The results of pre-clinical tests, together with certain manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Once an IND is in effect, the protocol for each clinical trial to be conducted under the IND must be submitted to the FDA, which may or may not allow the trial to proceed. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drugs or biologics to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practice requirements. For purposes of an NDA or BLA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase I: The product candidate is initially introduced to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its safety, tolerability and effectiveness. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase II: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications, and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted. 
● | Phase III: The product candidate is administered in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites, to obtain additional evidence of clinical efficacy and safety and to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product candidate. 
● | Phase IV: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval clinical trials to further assess the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic. 

 
The results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. NDAs or BLAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things.
 
Once the NDA or BLA submission has been accepted, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Pursuant to the FDA’s performance goals, NDA and BLA reviews are to be completed within 10 months, subject to extensions by the FDA. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA often inspects the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with good manufacturing practices. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with good clinical practices before approving an NDA or BLA. If the FDA determines that an NDA or BLA is not acceptable, then the FDA may outline the deficiencies and often will request that additional information be provided or additional clinical trials be completed. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional testing or information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
Further, even if regulatory approval of a product candidate is obtained, such approval would usually impose limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. Additionally, we would be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA with respect to any approved product, including requirements related to, among other things, drug or device listing, record-keeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, manufacturing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion, and reporting of adverse events associated with any approved products. Moreover, we could be required to conduct post-approval studies, such as Phase IV clinical trials, or surveillance programs to monitor the effect of any approved products, and the FDA has the authority to stop or limit further marketing of a product or impose more stringent labeling restrictions based on the results of these post-approval tests and programs or in the event of any unexpected or serious health or safety concern regarding any approved product.

Non-U.S. Regulation
 
If we pursue research and/or commercialization activities for our product candidates outside the United States, we would need to obtain necessary approvals from the regulatory authorities comparable to the FDA in applicable foreign jurisdictions before we could commence clinical trials or marketing of our product candidates in these jurisdictions. In addition, we would become subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding safety and efficacy of our product candidates and governing, among other things, clinical trials, commercial activities, manufacture and distribution of our product candidates. The requirements to obtain product approvals vary widely from country to country, and the FDA’s approval requirements, review procedures and timelines may not be the same as or even similar to the requirements or a comparable foreign regulator. As a result, even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate in one country, we may be required to undertake additional clinical trials or studies, submit additional information, wait for longer review periods or make other efforts in order to obtain regulatory approvals in other desirable geographic markets.
 
Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, constantly evolving and subject to significant change and fluctuation. The U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that impact our business include, among others:

● | the laws and regulations administered and enforced by the FDA, including the FDCA, Controlled Substances Act and other federal statutes and regulations, discussed above; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which generally prohibits, among other things, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration to induce the referral of an individual for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of an item or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
● | the federal false claims laws, which generally prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; 
● | the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, referred to collectively as the Affordable Care Act, which, in general and among other things, expands the government’s investigative and enforcement authority, including requiring pharmaceutical companies to record and disclose to government agencies any transfers of value to doctors and teaching hospitals, and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse, including amendments to the federal False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute to make it easier to bring suits under these statutes; 
● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1986, or HIPAA, as amended by the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which, in general and among other things, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and impose requirements for the use of standardized electronic transactions with respect to transmission of such information; and 
● | state law equivalents of each of these federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not be preempted by applicable federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Additionally, the healthcare compliance environment is continuously changing, with proposed revisions to or replacement of the Affordable Care Act at the federal level and with some states mandating implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, spending limits and reporting to state governments of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. Further, to the extent we continue to pursue operations in foreign countries, such as our clinical activities in Australia, or if we seek to sell any product that obtains regulatory approval in a foreign country, we would be subject to different reporting and other compliance requirements in multiple jurisdictions, including foreign laws and regulations comparable to the U.S. laws and regulations described above.
 
All of these laws impose penalties for non-compliance, some of which may be severe. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, fines or other monetary damages or orders forcing us to curtail or restructure our operations.
 
Other Regulatory Requirements and Environmental Matters
 
We are or may become subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals, as well as environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, any use and disposal by us of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and withdraw approvals.
 
In addition, to the extent we continue to pursue operations in foreign jurisdictions, we will be subject to anti-bribery laws in the United States and applicable foreign jurisdictions, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and comparable foreign laws. Further, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to other matters, including workplace health and safety, labor and employment, public reporting and taxation, among others, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including monetary penalties or imposition of sanctions or other corrective requirements.
 
Our Team
 
We have assembled a senior management team with many years of experience and success in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in research and development, commercialization and financing activities. In addition, we have assembled a clinical and regulatory team experienced in developing and advancing novel therapeutic approaches through clinical testing and regulatory approvals, including extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience to oversee our clinical, manufacturing and testing activities. Our team consists of a relatively small number of employees, as well as consultants and advisors regarding research and development, regulatory, compliance, healthcare and investor and public relations matters. We also expect to engage experts in healthcare and in general business to advise us in various capacities. For instance, we have in the past consulted with various oncology researchers and clinicians to provide counsel as part of our advisory panels for our ImmunoPulse® clinical programs, and we expect to continue to establish consulting and advisory relationships with scientific, clinical and medical experts in academia and industry to assist us with FDA submissions, clinical testing and identification and development of new product candidates.
 
As of July 31, 2017, we had a total of 35 employees, including 34 full-time employees and one part-time employee. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
