Our Business
 
We are a manufacturer of precision, large-scale fabricated and machined metal structural components and systems. We offer a full range of services required to transform raw materials into precision finished products. We sell these finished products to customers in two main industry groups: defense and precision industrial. The finished products are used in a variety of markets including defense, aerospace, nuclear, medical and precision industrial. Our mission is to be a leading end-to-end service provider to our customers by furnishing custom, fully integrated solutions for complete products that require custom fabrication, precision machining, assembly, integration, inspection, non-destructive evaluation and testing.
 
We work with our customers to manufacture products in accordance with the customers’ drawings and specifications. Our work complies with specific national and international codes and standards applicable to our industry. We believe that we have earned our reputation through outstanding technical expertise, attention to detail, and a total commitment to quality and excellence in customer service.
 
About Us
 
We are a Delaware corporation organized in 2005 under the name Lounsberry Holdings II, Inc. On February 24, 2006, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of our wholly owned subsidiary Ranor, Inc., or Ranor. Ranor, together with its predecessors, has been in continuous operation since 1956. Since February 24, 2006, our primary business has been the business of Ranor. On March 6, 2006, following the acquisition of Ranor, we changed our corporate name to TechPrecision Corporation. Our acquisition of Ranor was accounted for as a reverse acquisition.
 
Wuxi Critical Mechanical Components Co., Ltd., or WCMC, a limited company organized under the laws of the People’s Republic of China, or China, located in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, China, is our other wholly owned subsidiary. Over five years ago, we made the decision to exit manufacturing components for the alternative energy markets in China. We have no customers in China, and we have initiated a plan of termination to legally dissolve this subsidiary.
 
In 2020, as previously disclosed, we formed Stadco New Acquisition, LLC, or NewCo, for the purpose of effecting the acquisition of the business of Stadco, a company that manufactures precision parts for the defense and aerospace industries. As of the date of this Annual Report, this acquisition has not closed, and NewCo has no assets, liabilities or operations, other than in connection with the proposed acquisition.
 
Our executive offices are located at 1 Bella Drive, Westminster, Massachusetts 01473, and our telephone number is (978) 874-0591. Our website is www.techprecision.com. Information on our website, or any other website, is not incorporated by reference in this annual report.
 
References in this annual report to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar words refer to TechPrecision Corporation and its subsidiaries, Ranor, WCMC and NewCo, unless the context indicates otherwise, while references to “TechPrecision” refer to TechPrecision Corporation and not its subsidiaries. 
 
General
 
Our manufacturing operations within the United States are situated on approximately 65 acres in North Central Massachusetts. Our 145,000 square foot facility houses state-of-the-art equipment which gives us the capability to manufacture products as large as 100 tons. We offer a full range of services required to transform raw material into precision finished products. Our manufacturing capabilities include: fabrication operations (cutting, press and roll forming, assembly, welding, heat treating, blasting and painting) and machining operations including CNC (computer numerical controlled) horizontal and vertical milling centers. We also provide support services to our manufacturing capabilities: manufacturing engineering (planning, fixture and tooling development, and manufacturing), quality control (inspection and testing), materials procurement, production control (scheduling, project management and expediting), and final assembly.
 
All manufacturing is done in accordance with our written quality assurance program, which meets specific national codes, and international codes, standards, and specifications. Ranor holds several certificates of authorization issued by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors. The standards used for each customer project are specific to that customer’s needs, and we have implemented such standards into our manufacturing operations.

Products
 
We manufacture a wide variety of products pursuant to customer contracts and based on individual customer needs. We can also provide manufacturing engineering services to assist customers in optimizing their engineering designs for manufacturing efficiency. We do not design the products we manufacture, but rather manufacture according to “build-to-print” requirements specified by our customers. Accordingly, we do not distribute the products that we manufacture on the open market and we do not market any specific products on an on-going basis. We do not own the intellectual property rights to any proprietary marketed product, and we do not manufacture products in anticipation of orders. Manufacturing operations do not commence on any project before we receive a customer’s purchase order. We only enter into contracts that cover specific products within the capability of our resources.
 
Although we seek continuous production programs with predictable cost structures that provide long-term integrated solutions for our customers, our activities include a variety of both custom-based and production-based requirements. The custom-based work is typically either a prototype or unique, one-of-a-kind product. The production-based work is repeat work or a single product with multiple quantity releases.
 
Changes in market demand for our manufacturing expertise can be significant and sudden and require us to be able to adapt to the collective needs of the customers and industries that we serve. Understanding this dynamic, we believe we have developed the capability to transform our workforce to manufacture products for customers across different industries.
 
We serve customers in the defense, aerospace, nuclear, medical and precision industrial markets. Examples of products we have manufactured within such industries during recent years include, but are not limited to, custom components for ships and submarines, aerospace equipment, components for nuclear power plants and components for large scale medical systems.
 
Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic Update
 
Beginning with the new calendar year 2020, the novel strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19 spread worldwide, including to U.S jurisdictions where the Company does business, and became a global pandemic. The United States Government declared a national emergency and various state governments imposed “lockdown” and “shelter-in-place” orders intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19 that have severely restricted business, social activities and travel. The Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in which jurisdiction the Company’s manufacturing and executive offices are located, issued an emergency order on March 31, 2020, updated on April 28, 2020, imposing such an emergency order. This order was rescinded on May 15, 2020. As a designated “COVID-19 Essential Service” we continued our operations throughout the pendency of the order.
 
The full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, related business and travel restrictions and changes to social behavior remain uncertain as the health crisis continues to evolve globally. Management has been closely monitoring the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the Company and is taking reasonable precautions and following state and federal guidelines to protect the health and welfare of our employees, so we can continue to perform and deliver the products our customers need. During the fiscal year 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted all of the Company’s customers, suppliers and labor force. Management observed impacts from certain of its customers halting operations entirely for a period of time, shifting to remote work, and suspending on-site inspections – which resulted in delays of customer acceptance of completed work, milestone payments and the ultimate delivery of finished goods. While work restrictions have abated during the latter part of fiscal year 2021, the Company believes that the potential exists for other customer slowdowns or shutdowns to occur.
 
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, with respect to suppliers, the Company experienced extended lead-times for delivery of certain critical supplies, and with respect to the Company’s labor force, we experienced a few issues related to employee attendance such as voluntary avoidance of work out of fear of contracting the coronavirus, certain employees becoming ill, and others self-quarantining as a result of potential exposure to other individuals with symptoms of COVID-19. To date, including the first quarter of fiscal 2022, this has had a minor impact on the Company’s production levels, however, if more employees become ill in the future, the Company could experience a more significant disruption.
 
In light of the foregoing uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company determined it necessary to obtain additional funds. In this connection, as previously disclosed, on May 8, 2020, the Company, through Ranor, issued a promissory note, or the PPP Note, evidencing an unsecured loan in the amount of $1,317,100 made to Ranor under the Paycheck Protection Program, or the PPP. The PPP was established under the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or SBA. The loan to Ranor was made through Berkshire Bank. The PPP Note provides for an interest rate of 1.00% per year and matures two years after the issuance date. Principal and accrued interest are payable monthly in equal installments commencing on the date that is six months after the date funds are first disbursed on the loan and continuing through the maturity date, unless the PPP Note is forgiven. To be available for loan forgiveness, the PPP Note may only be used for payroll costs, costs related to certain group health care benefits and insurance premiums, rent payments, utility payments, mortgage interest payments and interest payments on any other debt obligation that were incurred before February 15, 2020.

On June 5, 2020, the PPP was amended to give borrowers more time to spend loan proceeds and request loan forgiveness. The amendments extended the length of the covered period as defined in the CARES Act from eight to twenty-four weeks, while allowing borrowers that received PPP loans before June 5, 2020 to elect to use the original eight-week covered period. In addition, the amendments provide that if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness of a loan within ten months after the last day of the covered period, the PPP loan is no longer deferred and the borrower must begin paying principal and interest. The Company applied for loan forgiveness within the ten month period on March 26, 2021.
 
On May 12, 2021, as authorized by Section 1106 of the CARES Act, the SBA has remitted to Berkshire Bank, the lender of record for the PPP loan, a payment of principal and interest in the amounts of $1,317,000 and $13,207, respectively, for forgiveness of the Company’s PPP loan. The funds credited to the PPP loan pay this loan off in full.
 
Given the speed and frequency of continuously evolving developments with respect to this pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate the magnitude of the potential impact on our financial condition and results of operations, and, the impacts could grow and continue for a longer period of time. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows remains uncertain. Accordingly, we believe that future operating results, including the operating results for fiscal 2022, could potentially be materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Source of Supply
 
Our manufacturing operations are partly dependent on the availability of raw materials. Most of our contracts with customers require the use of customer-supplied raw materials in the manufacture of their product. Accordingly, raw material requirements vary with each contract and are dependent upon customer requirements and specifications. We have established relationships with numerous suppliers. When we do buy raw materials, we endeavor to establish alternate sources of material supply to reduce our dependency on any one supplier.
 
Our projects include the manufacturing of products from various traditional as well as specialty metal alloys. These materials may include, but are not limited to: steel, nickel, monel, inconel, aluminum, stainless steel, and other alloys. Certain of these materials are subject to long-lead time delivery schedules. As noted above, since the beginning of calendar year 2020, we have experienced some adverse effects to our supply sources as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the Company has seen lead-times for delivery of certain critical supplies extended. While the overall situation has improved, we continue to experience sporadic delays and supply shortages for specific items. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, or fiscal 2021, two suppliers accounted for 10% or more of our purchased material. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, or fiscal 2020, two suppliers accounted for 10% or more of our purchased material.
 
Marketing
 
While we have significant customer concentration, we endeavor to broaden our customer base as well as the industries we serve. We market to our existing customer base and also initiate contacts with new potential customers through various sources including personal contacts, customer referrals, and referrals from other businesses. A significant portion of our business is the result of competitive bidding processes and a significant portion of our business is from contract negotiation. We believe that the reputation we have developed with our current customers represents an important part of our marketing effort.
 
Requests for quotations received from customers are reviewed to determine the specific requirements and our ability to meet such requirements. Quotations are prepared by estimating the material and labor costs and assessing our current backlog to determine our delivery commitments. Competitive bid quotations are submitted to the customer for review and award of contract. Negotiation bids typically require the submission of additional information to substantiate the quotation. The bidding process can range from several weeks for a competitive bid to several months for a negotiation bid before the customer awards a contract. However, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States slowed our acquisition of new customer purchase orders during fiscal year 2021 because of the inability of Company representatives to visit current and potential customers and discuss new orders.
 
Research and Product Development
 
Many of our customers generate drawings illustrating their projected unit design and technology requirements. Our research and product development activities are limited and focused on delivering robust production solutions to such projected unit design and technology requirements. We follow this product development methodology in all our major product lines. For these reasons, we incurred no expenses for research and development in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.

Principal Customers
 
A significant portion of our business is generated by a small number of major customers. The balance of our business consists of discrete projects for numerous other customers. As industry and market demand changes, our major customers may also change. Our ten largest customers generated approximately 99% and 97% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Our group of largest customers can change from year to year. Our largest single customer in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 was a prime defense contractor and accounted for 17% and 22% of our net sales during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Our defense customers are engaged in the development, delivery and support of advanced defense, security and aerospace systems, including the U.S. Navy’s Virginia-class fast attack submarine program and the U.S. Navy’s Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine program. We also serve customers who supply components to the nuclear power industry, and in our industrial sector, we build large-scale medical device components and assemblies for installation at certain medical institutions.
 
We historically have experienced, and continue to experience, customer concentration. A significant loss of business from our largest customer or a combination of several of our significant customers could result in lower operating profitability and/or operating losses if we are unable to replace such lost revenue from other sources.  The revenue derived from all of our customers in the designated industry groups for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 are displayed in the table below:
 

(dollars in thousands) | 2021 | | 2020 
-----------------------+--------+--------+--------
Net Sales | Amount | | Percent | | Amount | | Percent
Defense | $ | 12,651 | | 81 | % | $ | 13,368 | 83 | %
Precision Industrial | $ | 2,945 | | 19 | % | $ | 2,639 | 17 | %

 
The following table displays revenue generated by individual customers in specific industry sectors that accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in either fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020:
 

(dollars in thousands) | 2021 | | 2020 
--------------------------------+--------+-------+--------
Net Sales | Amount | | Percent | | Amount | | Percent
Defense Customer 1 | $ | 2,705 | | 17 | % | $ | 3,558 | 22 | %
Defense Customer 4 | $ | 2,683 | | 17 | % | $ | * | * | %
Defense Customer 2 | $ | 2,309 | | 15 | % | $ | 2,759 | 17 | %
Defense Customer 3 | $ | 2,145 | | 14 | % | $ | 2,063 | 13 | %
Precision Industrial Customer 1 | $ | * | | * | % | $ | 1,835 | 11 | %

 
* Revenue from the customer in this market was less than 10% of our total revenue during the period.
 
At March 31, 2021, we had a backlog of orders totaling approximately $18.6 million. We expect to deliver the backlog over the course of the next two to three fiscal years. The comparable backlog at March 31, 2020 was $16.8 million.
 
Competition
 
We face competition from both domestic and foreign entities in the manufacture of metal fabricated and machined precision components and equipment. The industry in which we compete is fragmented with no one dominant player. We compete against companies that are both larger and smaller than us in size and capacity. Some competitors may be better known, have greater resources at their disposal, and have lower production costs. For certain products, being a domestic manufacturer may play a role in determining whether we are awarded a certain contract. For example, we face limited foreign competition for our defense products. For other products and markets, we may be competing against foreign manufacturers who have a lower cost of production. If a contracting party has a relationship with a vendor and is required to place a contract for bids, the preferred vendor may provide or assist in the development of the specification for the product which may be tailored to that vendor’s products. In such event, we would be at a disadvantage in seeking to obtain that contract. We believe that customers focus on such factors as the quality of work, the reputation of the vendor, the perception of the vendor’s ability to meet the required schedule, and price in selecting a vendor for their products. We believe that our strengths in these areas allow us to compete effectively, and that as a result, we are one of a select group of companies that can provide the products and services we are able to provide.
Government Regulations
 
We provide a significant portion of our manufacturing services as a subcontractor to prime government contractors. Such prime government contractors are subject to government procurement and acquisition regulations which give the government the right to terminate these contracts for convenience, certain renegotiation rights, and rights of inspection. Any government action which affects our customers who are prime government contractors would affect us.
 
Because of the nature and use of our products, we are subject to compliance with quality assurance programs, compliance with which is a condition for our ability to bid on government contracts and subcontracts. We believe we are in compliance with all of these programs.

We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to manufacturing operations, such as federal and state occupational health and safety laws, and environmental laws, which are discussed in more detail below under “-Environmental Compliance.”
 
Environmental Compliance
 
We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated by those laws and the filing of reports with environmental agencies, and we are subject to periodic inspections to monitor our compliance. We believe that we are currently in compliance with applicable environmental regulations. As part of our normal business practice, we are required to develop and file reports and maintain logbooks that document all environmental issues within our organization. We may engage outside consultants to assist us in keeping current on developments in environmental regulations. Expenditures for environmental compliance purposes during fiscal 2021 and 2020 were not material.
Occupational Health and Safety Laws
 
Our business and operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations intended to protect our employees. Due to the nature of manufacturing, we are subject to substantial regulations related to safety in the workplace. In addition to the requirements of the state government of Massachusetts and the local governments having jurisdiction over our plant, we must comply with federal health and safety regulations, the most significant of which are enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”).
 
Further, our manufacturing and other business operations and facilities are subject to additional federal, state or local laws or regulations including supply chain transparency, conflict minerals sourcing and disclosure, transportation and other laws or regulations relating to health and safety requirements, including COVID-19 safety and prevention. Our operations are also subject to federal, state and local labor laws relating to employee privacy, wage and hour matters, overtime pay, harassment and discrimination, equal opportunity and employee leaves and benefits. We are also subject to existing and emerging federal and state laws relating to data security and privacy.
 
It is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements and our procedures and internal controls are designed to promote such compliance. Expenditures for compliance with occupational health and safety laws and regulations during fiscal 2021 and 2020 were not material.
 
Intellectual Property Rights
 
Presently, we have no registered intellectual property rights other than certain trademarks for our name and other business and marketing materials. In the course of our business we develop know-how for use in the manufacturing process. Although we have non-disclosure policies in place with respect to our personnel and in our contractual relationships, we cannot assure you that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to this know-how.
Human Capital Resources
 
The success of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and develop a workforce of skilled employees at all levels of our organization. We provide our employees base wages and salaries that we believe are competitive and consistent with employee positions, and work with local, regional, and state-wide agencies to facilitate workforce hiring and development initiatives. 
 
As of March 31, 2021, we had 93 employees, of whom all are full time employees, 23 are salaried and 70 are hourly. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
 
In connection with the outbreak of COVID-19, our production and support workforce continued to work in-person at our facility to provide vital products and services to our customers, while many of our employees in support and administrative functions have effectively worked in-person and remotely since mid-March 2020.
