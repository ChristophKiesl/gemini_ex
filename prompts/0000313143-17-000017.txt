ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Haemonetics is a global healthcare company dedicated to providing a suite of innovative hematology products and solutions to customers to help them improve patient care and reduce the cost of healthcare. Our technology addresses important medical markets, including blood and plasma component collection, the surgical suite, and hospital transfusion services. When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” mean Haemonetics.
Haemonetics was founded in 1971 as a medical device company and is a pioneer and market leader in developing and manufacturing automated blood component collection devices and surgical blood salvage devices. 
Blood and its components (plasma, platelets, and red cells) have many vital and frequently life-saving clinical applications. Plasma is used for patients with major blood loss and is manufactured into biopharmaceuticals to treat a variety of illnesses, including immune diseases and coagulation disorders. Red cells treat trauma patients or patients undergoing surgery with high blood loss, such as open heart surgery or organ transplant. Platelets have many uses in patient care, including supporting cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Blood is essential to a modern healthcare system. 
Haemonetics develops and markets a wide range of devices and solutions to serve our customers. We provide plasma collection systems and software which enable plasma fractionators to make life saving pharmaceuticals. We provide analytical devices for measuring hemostasis which enable healthcare providers to better manage their patients’ bleeding risk. Haemonetics makes blood processing systems and software which make blood donation more efficient and track life giving blood components. Finally, Haemonetics supplies systems and software which facilitate blood transfusions and cell processing. 
Market and Products
Product Lines
In fiscal 2017, we organized our products into four categories for purposes of evaluating and developing their growth potential: Plasma, Hemostasis Management, Blood Center and Cell Processing. For that purpose, “Plasma” included plasma collection devices and disposables, plasma donor management software, and anticoagulant and saline sold to plasma customers. “Hemostasis Management” included devices and methodologies for measuring coagulation characteristics of blood, such as our TEG® Hemostasis Analyzer. “Blood Center” included blood collection and processing devices and disposables for red cells, platelets and whole blood as well as related donor management software. “Cell Processing” included surgical blood salvage systems, specialized blood cell processing systems, disposables and blood transfusion management software.
We believe that Plasma and Hemostasis Management have the greatest growth potential, while Cell Processing innovation offers an opportunity to increase market share and expand into new segments. Blood Center competes in challenging markets which require us to manage the business differently, including reducing costs, shrinking the scope of the current product line, and evaluating opportunities to exit unfavorable customer contracts. We are progressing toward a streamlined operating model with a management and cost structure that can bring about sustainable productivity improvement across the organization. Overall implementation of our new model began in fiscal 2017 and will continue into fiscal 2018 and 2019.

• | Plasma

The Plasma Collection Market for Fractionation — Human plasma is collected and processed by biopharmaceutical companies into therapeutic and diagnostic products that aid in the treatment of immune diseases and coagulation disorders. While plasma is also used to aid patients with extreme blood loss, such as trauma victims, biopharmaceutical companies solely focus on the pharmaceutical uses of plasma. 
Many biopharmaceutical companies are vertically integrated and are now collecting and fractionating the plasma required to manufacture pharmaceuticals. The vertical integration of these customers paved the way for highly efficient plasma supply chain management and leveraging information technology to manage operations from the point of plasma donation to fractionation to the production of the final product.
Haemonetics' Plasma Products — Built around our automated plasma collection devices and related disposables, our portfolio of products and services is designed to support multiple facets of plasma collector operations. We have a long-standing commitment to understanding our customers' collection and manufacturing processes. As a result, we aim to design equipment that is durable, dependable, and easy to use, and provide comprehensive training and support to our plasma collection customers. 
1

Today, the vast majority of plasma collections worldwide are performed using automated collection technology because it is safer and more cost-effective. With our PCS® (Plasma Collection System) brand automated plasma collection technology, more plasma can be collected during any one donation event because the other blood components are returned to the donor through the sterile disposable sets used for the plasma donation procedure.
We offer multiple products necessary for plasma collection and storage, including PCS® brand plasma collection equipment and disposables, plasma collection containers and intravenous solutions. We also offer a portfolio of integrated information technology platforms for plasma customers to manage their donors, operations, and supply chain. Our software products automate the donor interview and qualification process, streamline the workflow process in the plasma center, provide the controls necessary to evaluate donor suitability, determine the ability to release units collected, and manage unit distribution. With our software solutions, plasma collectors can manage processes across the plasma supply chain, react quickly to business changes, and implement opportunities to reduce costs.
In April, 2017, we submitted a new plasmapheresis device, the PCS® 300, for 510(k) regulatory clearance with the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and continue to work on future enhancements to this important product, some of which may require additional clearances. 
Our Plasma business unit represented 46.4%, 42.0%, and 38.8% of our total revenue in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

• | Hospital

Hemostasis Management
The Hemostasis Management Market — Hemostasis refers to a patient's ability to form and maintain blood clots. Hemostasis Management plays a role in various medical procedures including liver transplant, cardiovascular procedures, trauma and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). By understanding a patient’s clotting ability, clinicians can better plan for the patient’s care, deciding in advance whether to start or discontinue use of certain drugs or determine the likelihood of the patient's need for a transfusion and which blood components will be most effective in minimizing blood loss and reducing clotting risk. Such planning supports better care, which can lead to lower hospital costs through a reduction in unnecessary donor blood transfusions, reduced adverse transfusion reactions, and shorter intensive care unit and hospital stays. 
Haemonetics’ Hemostasis Management Products — We have two device platforms which we market to hospitals and laboratories as an alternative to less comprehensive blood tests: the TEG® 5000 analyzer, which we acquired in the 2007 acquisition of Haemoscope Corporation, and the TEG® 6s device, which we license from Cora Healthcare, Inc., a company established by Haemoscope's founders. Under the license from Cora Healthcare, we have exclusive rights to manufacture and commercialize TEG® 6s in hospitals and hospital laboratory fields.
Both of our TEG® systems are blood diagnostic instruments that measure a patient's hemostasis. This information enables caregivers to decide the best blood-related clinical treatment for the patient in order to minimize blood loss and reduce clotting risk. The TEG® 5000 analyzer is approved for a broad set of indications in all of our markets. The TEG® 6s and TEG® Manager are approved for the same set of indications as the TEG® 5000 in Europe, Australia and Japan. In the U.S., TEG® 6s is approved for limited indications, including cardiovascular surgery and cardiology. We are pursuing a broader set of indications for the TEG® 6s in the U.S., including trauma. 
Our Hemostasis Management business unit represented 7.5%, 6.5%, and 5.6% of our total revenue in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Cell Processing
The Cell Processing Market — Loss of blood is common in many surgical procedures, including open heart, trauma, transplant, vascular, and orthopedic procedures, and the need for transfusion of oxygen-carrying red cells to make up for lost blood volume is routine. Patients commonly receive donor blood which carries various risks, including transfusion with the wrong blood type, transfusion of a blood-borne disease or infectious agent, transfusion reactions including death, but more commonly chills, fevers or other side effects that can prolong a patient’s recovery.
An alternative to allogeneic blood is surgical cell salvage, also known as autotransfusion, which reduces or eliminates a patient’s need for blood donated from others and ensures that the patient receives the freshest and safest blood possible — his or her own. Surgical cell salvage involves the collection of a patient’s own blood during or after surgery for reinfusion of red cells to that patient. Blood is suctioned from the surgical site or collected from a wound or chest drain, processed and washed through a centrifuge-based system that yields concentrated red cells available for transfusion back to the patient. This process occurs in a sterile, closed-circuit, single-use consumable set that is fitted 
2

into an electromechanical device. We market our surgical blood salvage products to surgical specialists, primarily cardiovascular, orthopedic, and trauma surgeons, and to surgical suite service providers. 
In recent years, more efficient blood use and less invasive cardiovascular surgeries have reduced demand for autotransfusion in these procedures and contributed to intense competition in mature markets, while increased access to healthcare in emerging economies has provided new markets and sources of growth. 
Orthopedic procedures have seen similar to the changes with improved blood management practices, including the use of tranexamic acid to treat and prevent post-operative bleeding, have significantly reduced the number of transfusions and autotransfusion. 
Haemonetics’ Cell Processing Products — Haemonetics offers a range of solutions that improve a hospital's systems for acquiring blood, storing it in the hospital, and dispensing it efficiently and correctly. Over the last few years, hospitals have become increasingly focused on of their need to control costs and improve patient safety by managing blood more effectively. Our products and integrated solution platforms help hospitals optimize performance of blood acquisition, storage, and distribution.
The Cell Saver® system is a surgical blood salvage system targeted to procedures that involve mid to high-volume blood loss, such as cardiovascular or orthopedic surgeries. It has become the standard of care for these surgeries. The Cell Saver® Elite® system is our most advanced autotransfusion option to minimize allogeneic blood use for surgeries with medium to high blood loss.
The OrthoPAT® surgical blood salvage system is targeted to orthopedic procedures, such as hip and knee replacements, which involve slower, lower volume blood loss that often occurs well after surgery. The system is designed to remain with the patient following surgery, to recover blood and produce a washed red cell product for autotransfusion.
Our Cell Processing software products help hospitals track and safely deliver stored blood products. SafeTrace Tx® is our software solution that helps manage blood product inventory, perform patient cross-matching, and manage transfusions. In addition, our BloodTrack® suite of solutions manages tracking and control of blood products from the hospital blood center through transfusion to the patient. 
Our Cell Processing business unit represented 11.9%, 12.4%, and 13.2% of our total revenue in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

• | Blood Center

The Blood Center Market — There are millions of blood donations throughout the world every year that produce blood products for transfusion to surgical, trauma, or chronically ill patients. Patients typically receive only the blood components necessary to treat a particular clinical condition. Platelet therapy is frequently used to alleviate the effects of chemotherapy and help patients with bleeding disorders and to stop bleeding. Red cells are often transfused to patients to replace blood lost during surgery. Red cells are also transfused to patients with blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia or aplastic anemia. Plasma, in addition to its role in creating life-saving pharmaceuticals, is frequently transfused to replace blood volume in trauma victims and surgical patients.
The demand for blood components varies across the world. While overall we expect total demand to remain stable, demand in individual markets can vary greatly. Highly populated emerging market countries are seeing demand growth as they expand healthcare coverage. As greater numbers of people gain access to more advanced medical treatment, demand for blood components, plasma-derived drugs, and surgical procedures increases. In more mature markets, the development of less invasive procedures with lower associated blood loss and better blood management have offset the demand increases from aging populations. 
Most donations worldwide are manual whole blood donations. In this process, whole blood is collected from the donor and then transported to a laboratory where it is separated into its components: red cells, platelets and/or plasma. 
In addition to manual collections, there is a significant market for automated component blood collections. In this procedure, the blood separation process is automated and occurs in real-time while a person is donating blood. In this separation method, only the specific blood component targeted is collected, and the remaining components are returned to the blood donor. Automated blood component collection allows significantly more of the targeted blood component to be collected during a donation event.
Haemonetics’ Blood Center Products — Today, Haemonetics offers automated blood component and manual whole blood collection systems to blood collection centers to collect blood products efficiently and cost effectively. 
3

We market the MCS® (Multicomponent Collection System) brand apheresis equipment which is designed to collect specific blood components integrated from the donor. Utilizing the MCS® automated platelet collection protocols, blood centers collect one or more therapeutic “doses” of platelets during a single donation. The MCS® two-unit protocol or double red cell collection device helps blood collectors optimize the collection of red cells by automating the blood separation function, eliminating the need for laboratory processing, and enabling the collection of two units of red cells from a single donor thus maximizing the amount of red cells collected per eligible donor and helping to mitigate red cell shortages in countries where this problem exists. Blood collectors can also use the MCS® system to collect one unit of red cells and a "jumbo" (double) unit of plasma, or one unit of red cells and one unit of platelets from a single donor. The MCS® plasma protocol, which provides the possibility of collecting 600-800ml of plasma for either transfusion to patients or for use by the pharmaceutical industry, completes the comprehensive portfolio of different blood component collection options on this device.
Haemonetics also offers a portfolio of products for manual whole blood collection and processing. Haemonetics' portfolio of disposable whole blood collection and component storage sets offer flexibility in collecting a unit of whole blood and the subsequent production and storage of the red blood cell, platelet or plasma products, including options for in-line or dockable filters for leukoreduction of any blood component.
With the ACP® (Automated Cell Processor) brand, Haemonetics offers a solution to automate the washing and freezing of red cell components. The automated red cell washing procedure removes plasma proteins within the red cell units to provide a safer product for transfusion to frequently transfused patients, neonates, or patients with a history of transfusion reactions. The automated glycerolization and deglycerolization steps are required to prepare red cells for frozen storage. Freezing the red cell units can expand the shelf life of these products up to 10 years. Customers utilize this technology to implement strategic red cell inventories for large scale catastrophes, storage of rare blood types, or enhanced inventory management. 
Blood Center software solutions help blood center collectors improve efficiencies of blood collection and supply and help ensure donor safety. This includes solutions for blood drive planning, donor recruitment and retention, blood collection, component manufacturing and distribution. Our products SafeTrace® and El Dorado Donor® donation and blood unit management systems span blood center operations and automate and track operations from the recruitment of the blood donor to the disposition of the blood product. Our Hemasphere® software solution provides support for more efficient blood drive planning, and Donor Doc® and e-Donor® software help to improve recruitment and retention. 
Our Blood Center business unit represented 34.3%, 39.1%, and 42.4% of our total revenue in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Although we address our customers' needs through multiple product lines, we manage our business as five operating segments based primarily on geography: (a) North America Plasma, (b) Americas Blood Center and Hospital, (c) Europe, Middle East and Africa (collectively "EMEA"), (d) Asia Pacific and (e) Japan. The North America Plasma reporting unit is a separate operating segment with dedicated segment management due the size and scale of the Plasma business unit.
For financial reporting purposes, we aggregate our five operating segments into four reportable segments which include:

• | Japan


• | EMEA


• | North America Plasma


• | All Other

The financial information required for segments is included herein in Note 14, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Marketing/Sales/Distribution
We market and sell our products to biopharmaceutical companies, blood collection groups and independent blood centers, hospitals and hospital service providers, group purchasing organizations and national health organizations through our own direct sales force (including full-time sales representatives and clinical specialists) as well as independent distributors. Sales representatives target the primary decision-makers within each of those organizations.
United States
In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, 59.0%, 57.2%, and 54.4%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues were generated in the U.S., where we primarily use a direct sales force to sell our products. See Note 14, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Outside the United States
In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, 41.0%, 42.8%, and 45.6%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues were generated through sales to non-U.S. customers. Outside the United States, we use a combination of direct sales force and distributors. See Note 14, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Research and Development
Our research and development centers in the United States and Switzerland ensure that protocol variations are incorporated to closely match local customer requirements. In addition, Haemonetics maintains software development operations in Canada and France.
Customer collaborations are also an important part of our technical strength and competitive advantage. These collaborations with customers and transfusion experts provide us with ideas for new products and applications, enhanced protocols, and potential test sites as well as objective evaluations and expert opinions regarding technical and performance issues.
The development of blood component separation products, hemostasis analyzers, and software has required us to maintain technical expertise in various engineering disciplines, including mechanical, electrical, software, and biomedical engineering and material science. Innovations resulting from these various engineering efforts enable us to develop systems that are faster, smaller, and more user-friendly, or that incorporate additional features important to our customer base.
In fiscal 2017, research and development resources were primarily allocated to supporting next generation plasma collection and software systems. We will continue to invest resources in clinical programs for our Hemostasis Management business unit, most notably a global registry study for our TEG® platform.
Manufacturing
Our principal manufacturing operations are located in the United States, Mexico, and Malaysia.
In general, our production activities occur in controlled settings or “clean room” environments. Each step of the manufacturing and assembly process is quality checked, qualified, and validated. Critical process steps and materials are documented to ensure that every unit is produced consistently and meets performance requirements. Our equipment and disposable manufacturing 
5

sites are certified to the ISO 13485 standard and to the Medical Device Directive allowing placement of the CE mark of conformity.
Plastics are the principal component of our disposable products. Contracts with our suppliers help mitigate some of the short-term effects of price volatility in this market. However, increases in the price of petroleum derivatives could result in corresponding increases in our costs to procure plastic raw materials.
Contractors manufacture some component sets, equipment, and liquid solutions according to our specifications. We maintain important relationships with two Japanese manufacturers that produce finished disposables in Singapore, Japan, and Thailand. We have also engaged Sanmina Corporation to be the sole manufacturer of certain equipment. Certain parts and components are purchased from sole source vendors. We believe that, if necessary, alternative sources of supply are available in most cases, and could be secured within a relatively short period of time. Nevertheless, an interruption in supply could temporarily interfere with production schedules and affect our operations.
Our equipment is designed in-house and assembled by us or our contracted manufacturers from components that are manufactured to our specifications. The completed instruments are programmed, calibrated, and tested to ensure compliance with our engineering and quality assurance specifications. Inspection checks are conducted throughout the manufacturing process to verify proper assembly and functionality. When mechanical and electronic components are sourced from outside vendors, those vendors must meet detailed qualification and process control requirements.
Intellectual Property
We consider our intellectual property rights to be important to our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as provisions in our agreements with third parties, to protect our intellectual property rights. We hold patents in the United States and many international jurisdictions on some of our machines, processes, disposables and related technologies. These patents cover certain elements of our systems, including protocols employed in our equipment and certain aspects of our processing chambers and disposables. Our patents may cover current products, products in markets we plan to enter, or products in markets we plan to license, or the patents may be defensive in that they are directed to technologies not currently embodied in our current products. We may also license patent rights from third parties that cover technologies that we plan to use in our business. To maintain our competitive position, we rely on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel and on our patent rights. We pursue an active and formal program of invention disclosure and patent application in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We own various trademarks that have been registered in the United States and certain other countries.
Our policy is to obtain patent and trademark rights in the U.S. and foreign countries where such rights are available and we believe it is commercially advantageous to do so. However, the standards for international protection of intellectual property vary widely. We cannot assure that pending patent and trademark applications will result in issued patents and registered trademarks, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that our patents will not be determined invalid.
Competition
To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new cost-effective products, information technology platforms, and business services. We believe that our ability to maintain a competitive advantage will continue to depend on a combination of factors. Some factors are largely within our control such as: (i) maintenance of a positive reputation among our customers, (ii) development of new products which meet our customer's needs, (iii) obtaining regulatory approvals for our products in key markets, (iv) obtaining patents which protect our innovations, (v) development and protection of proprietary know-how in important technological areas, (vi) product quality, safety and cost effectiveness and (vii) continual and rigorous documentation of clinical performance. Other factors are outside of our control. We could see changes in regulatory standards or clinical practice which favor a competitor's technology or reduce revenues in key areas of our business.
In addition, we face competition from several large, global companies with product offerings similar to ours, such as Terumo BCT, LivaNova Plc and Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA. Terumo and Fresenius, in particular, have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do and are strong competitors in a number of our businesses. The following provides an overview of the key competitors in each of our four global product enterprises.

• | Plasma

In the automated plasma collection market, we principally compete with the Fresenius' Fenwal product line, on the basis of quality, reliability, ease of use, services and technical features of the collection systems, and on the long-term cost-effectiveness of equipment and disposables. In China, the market is populated by local producers of a product that is intended to be similar to ours. Recently, those competitors have expanded to markets beyond China, including 
6

European and South American countries. In the field of plasma related software, MAK Systems is the primary commercial competitor along with applications developed internally by our customers.

• | Hospital

Hemostasis Management
The TEG® Thrombelastograph Hemostasis Analyzer is used primarily in surgical applications. Our principal competitor in Europe and the United States is ROTEM analyzers. ROTEM was recently acquired by a subsidiary of Werfen, Instrumentation Laboratories, which is a United States based laboratory instrument manufacturer. Instrumentation Laboratories has also recently acquired Accriva Diagnostics, the owner of Hemochron and Verifynow hemostasis management products. Other competitive technologies include standard coagulation tests and platelet function testing. There are also additional technologies being explored to assess viscoelastic and other characteristics that can provide insights into the coagulation status of a patient. The TEG® analyzer competes with other laboratory tests based on its ability to provide a more complete picture of a patient's hemostasis at a single point in time and the ability to measure the clinically relevant platelet function for an individual patient.
Cell Processing
In the intraoperative surgical blood salvage market, competition is based on reliability, ease of use, service, support, and price. For high-volume platforms, each manufacturer's technology is similar, and our Cell Saver technology competes principally with products offered by LivaNova Plc, Medtronic, and Fresenius.
In the perioperative surgical blood salvage market, our OrthoPAT system competes primarily against (i) non-automated processing systems whose end product is an unwashed red blood cell unit for transfusion to the patient, (ii) transfusions of donated blood and (iii) coagulation therapies, principally tranexamic acid. 
The competition for processing cells for frozen storage is based on the level of automation, labor-intensiveness and system type (open versus closed). Open systems may be weaker in good manufacturing process compliance. Moreover, blood processed after freezing through open systems has a 24-hour shelf life. 
BloodTrack's primary competition are manual cross-matching and delivery systems. However, both Mediware in the United States and MSoft, based in England, have competitive software offerings. 

• | Blood Center

We have several competitors in the Blood Center product lines, some of which compete across all blood components and others that are more specialized.
Terumo and Fresenius are our major competitors in platelet collection. In platelet collections, there are two areas of competition - automated collection and pooled random donor. In the automated collection area, competition is based on continual performance improvement, as measured by the time and efficiency of platelet collection and the quality of the platelets collected. Each of these companies has taken a different technological approach from ours in designing their systems for automated platelet collection. A key point of competition is speed, particularly in collecting two units of platelets from a single donor. While not all donors are eligible to donate two units, we have seen our competitors gain an advantage in markets with a significant number of eligible donors. Terumo, in particular, has an advantage in the collection of two units of platelets from a single donor. In addition to automated platelet collection offerings, we now also compete in the pooled random donor platelet segment from whole blood collections from which pooled platelets are derived with the Acrodose product or buffy coat pooling sets. 
Terumo and Fresenius are also competitors in the automated red cell collection market. However, it is important to note that most double red cell collection is done in the U.S. and less than 10% of the red cells collected in the U.S. annually are collected via automation. Therefore, we also compete with the traditional method of collecting red cells from the manual collection of whole blood. We compete on the basis of total cost, type-specific collection, process control, product quality, and inventory management.
We face intense competition in our whole blood business on the basis of quality and price. In North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific our main competitors are Fresenius, MacoPharma and Terumo. We do not have significant whole blood revenues in Japan today. With the ACP® (Automated Cell Processor) brand, Haemonetics offers a closed system cell processor which gives blood processed through it a 14-day shelf life after being removed from frozen storage. We compete with Terumo's open systems in this market.
In Blood Center software, MAK Technologies is a competitor along with systems developed internally by our customers.
7

Our technical staff is highly skilled, but certain competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger technical staffing at their disposal. There can be no assurance that competitors will not direct substantial efforts and resources toward the development and marketing of products competitive with those of Haemonetics.
Significant Customers
In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 42%, 36% and 48% of our net revenues, respectively. In fiscal 2017 and 2016, one plasma collection customer accounted for approximately 14% and 11% of our net revenues, respectively. There were no significant customers that accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues in fiscal 2015.
Government Regulation
Medical Device Regulation
The products we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by the Center of Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”), Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”) and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research ("CDER") of the FDA, and other non-United States regulatory bodies.
All medical devices introduced to the United States market since 1976 are required by the FDA, as a condition of marketing, to secure either a 510(k) pre-market notification clearance or an approved premarket approval application (“PMA”). In the United States, software used to automate blood center operations and blood collections and to track those components through the system are considered by the FDA to be medical devices, subject to 510(k) pre-market notification. Intravenous solutions (blood anticoagulants, solutions for storage of red blood cells, and saline) marketed by us for use with our manual collection and automated systems requires us to obtain an approved New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) from CBER or CDER. A 510(k) pre-market clearance indicates the FDA’s agreement with an applicant’s determination that the product for which clearance is sought is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed medical device. The process of obtaining a 510(k) clearance may involve the submission of clinical data and supporting information. The process of obtaining an NDA approval for solutions is likely to take much longer than 510(k) clearances because the FDA review process is more complicated.
The FDA’s Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, requires the maintenance of certain records and provides for inspections of our facilities. There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacturing and marketing of our products. We maintain customer complaint files, record all lot numbers of disposable products, and conduct periodic audits to assure compliance with applicable regulations. We place special emphasis on customer training and advise all customers that device operation should be undertaken only by qualified personnel.
The FDA can ban certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order repair, replacement or refund of these devices, and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain certain violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations.
We are also subject to regulation in the countries outside the United States in which we market our products. The member states of the European Union (EU) have adopted the European Medical Device Directive, which creates a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries. These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to obtain CE Marking for their products. Outside of the EU, many of the regulations applicable to our products are similar to those of the FDA. However, the national health or social security organizations of certain countries require our products to be registered by those countries before they can be marketed in those countries.
We have complied with these regulations and have obtained such registrations where we market our products. Federal, state and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of products such as ours are subject to change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes might have on our business.

Conflict Minerals
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use of "Conflict Minerals" mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. The conflict minerals include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, and their derivatives. These requirements could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products. There will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products.
Other Regulation
We are also subject to various environmental, health and general safety laws, directives and regulations both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Our operations, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe that sound environmental, health and safety performance contributes to our competitive strength while benefiting our customers, shareholders and employees.
Environmental Matters
Failure to comply with international, federal and local environmental protection laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our business or could require material capital expenditures. We continue to monitor changes in U.S. and international environmental regulations that may present a significant risk to the business, including laws or regulations relating to the manufacture or sale of products using plastics.
Employees
As of April 1, 2017, we employed the full-time equivalent of 3,107 persons.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information
Statements contained in this report, as well as oral statements we make which are prefaced with the words “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “continue,” “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” “designed,” and similar expressions, are intended to identify forward looking statements regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operations, business strategy, results of operations, and financial position. These statements are based on our current expectations and estimates as to prospective events and circumstances about which we can give no firm assurance. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made. As it is not possible to predict every new factor that may emerge, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of our actual future financial condition or results. 
These forward-looking statements, like any forward-looking statements, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including demand for whole blood and blood components, changes in executive management, changes in operations, restructuring and turnaround plans, asset revaluations to reflect current business conditions, asset sales, technological advances in the medical field and standards for transfusion medicine and our ability to successfully offer products that incorporate such advances and standards, product quality, market acceptance, regulatory uncertainties, including in the receipt or timing of regulatory approvals, the effect of economic and political conditions, the impact of competitive products and pricing, blood product reimbursement policies and practices, foreign currency exchange rates, changes in customers’ ordering patterns including single-source tenders, the effect of industry consolidation as seen in the plasma and blood center markets, the effect of communicable diseases and the effect of uncertainties in markets outside the U.S. (including Europe and Asia) in which we operate and other risks detailed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The foregoing list should not be construed as exhaustive.
