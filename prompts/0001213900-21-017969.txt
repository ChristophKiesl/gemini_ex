Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Signet International Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on February 2, 2005 in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware as 51142, Inc. The Company changed its corporate name to Signet International Holdings, Inc. in conjunction with the September 8, 2005 transaction discussed below.
 
On September 8, 2005, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement and Share Exchange (Agreement) by and among Signet International Holdings, Inc. (Signet); Signet Entertainment Corporation (SIG) and the shareholders of SIG (Shareholders) (collectively SIG and the SIG shareholders shall be known as the “SIG Group”), Signet acquired 100.0% of the then issued and outstanding preferred and common stock of SIG for a total of 3,421,000 common shares and 5,000,000 preferred shares of Signet’s stock issued to the SIG Group. Pursuant to the agreement, SIG became a wholly owned subsidiary of Signet.
 
Signet Entertainment Corporation was incorporated on October 17, 2003 in accordance with the Laws of the State of Florida. SIG was formed to establish a television network “The Gaming and Entertainment Network”. To date, this effort has been incomplete. The Company has abandoned pursuant of any gaming or entertainment operations. The Company’s current principal business plan is to focus in developing advanced technologies, energy solutions and medical devices. By utilizing sub licensing arrangements for the intellectual property licenses we acquire, our strategy is focused on identifying strategic partners that can develop and market products based on the underlying technologies. We do not claim to have expertise in the various intellectual properties we seek to acquire. Instead, our value is based on our ability to assess technologies and appropriate partners for the commercialization of products and process based on the underlying intellectual property. Research and development of the underly technologies is being performed at major universities in Florida. The development of a commercial products will be conducted by our strategic partners.
 
On February 28, 2018, the Company redomiciled in the state of Nevada.
 
In determining whether we will pursue any particular intellectual property we have engaged outside consulting scientists to evaluate the viability of the underlying technology and its commercial viability. We do not have a set metric for determining the viability. We rely solely on the expertise of our consultants. These consultants hold certain expertise in the specific field related to the underlying technology. These include 3 consultants for graphene applications, an engineer in magnetic energy, and two consultants specializing in negotiating terms with universities and public institutions. All consultants have agreed to receive compensation in the form of common stock. These agreements have expired, but the consultants continue to provide case by case analysis when required.
 
As we approach the second quarter of 2021, we are pleased with the progress we have made. We have accomplished each phase of our growth and we have remained consistent with our responsibilities.
 
Our status as an emerging growth public company is materializing before us. We hear from other universities on a regular basis that tells us we are welcome to the fraternity of research scientists, engineers, and inventors. We have increased efforts to create more awareness of our presence by engaging a social media specialist who will keep the public informed of all our progress and assist us with shareholders relations. Our team is growing and meeting our needs.
 
Generally, the option fee ranges from $1,200 to $5,000.
 
Since all of the technologies we have options to license are trending, unique, and further advanced than any others we know of on the market today, we must maintain our edge and seek constant improvement to stay viable—and we are doing just that.
 
Because of our efforts, we have our path laid out before us. Last year´s strategy allowed us to take the proper steps to arrive at this juncture. We are now proudly holding ourselves out to the world as a viable and worthy consortium from which multinationals can acquire advanced, patented technology. Although our technologies may necessitate some retooling and possibly an avant-garde approach in implementing, we feel that in considering the alternative technologies presently available, ours is the superior choice.
 
1

 

We have completed these efforts to identify and locate a niche, function, and purpose for all our products. Inasmuch as our products are ‘green’ in nature and innovative in design, we feel these technologies can easily be integrated into daily life to the benefit of all. We all will see great progress and never to look back.
 
Although our business plan is highly dependent upon our usage of licensed intellectual property described herein, we have we have only exercised two of our options for exclusive licenses to date. Currently, the Company has non-exclusive options for licenses of various intellectual properties. These options may expire, and we cannot ensure that the options will be renewed. As they are non-exclusive, we also have no way to protect ourselves from other parties utilizing the underlying intellectual property before we exercise our option and move toward commercialization of the underlying technology. We further have not entered into formal negotiations regarding the terms of a formal licensing agreement, such as, but not limited to, royalty fees, minimum royalties, duration, exclusivity, funding requirements, or limitations on use. This limits our ability to determine the commercial viability of any given technology. However, we believe that we have had and continue to have good working relationships with the institutions owning the intellectual property such that our eventual use of the intellectual property will be formulated in a manner that ensures positive growth for the Company.
 
Our Plan
 
Our plan is to continue to raise awareness of our rights to license patented technologies. Our plan requires that we raise sufficient capital in order to exercise those certain options to secure the licenses. Our model is based on utilizing the expertise of research and development facilities in the Florida university system in order to deploy commercially viable products into the market. We currently are developing our marketing plan and commercial modelling. This process involves press releases, social media, marketing, expanding our contacts with professionals in interrelated fields of study, such as dermatological associations, or aviation, engineering, healthcare or energy related associations, representatives and groups, and increasing and building upon investor relationships in the private and public sectors.
 
We plan to first file all our required reports with the SEC. Once this is accomplished, we will focus full global attention raising funds to secure our licensing rights in the technologies represented by the various patents. We will attract interest and sell or license rights for the use of our technologies either geographically or industry specific. Anticipating revenue from sale of rights or even licensing is a difficult dynamic to anticipate. However, to offer illustrations of prior transactions accomplished in the past few years of similar or related technologies, attached are abstracts from published postings.
 
Since we are a public company, we have the advantages of not only raising capital through private placements, debentures, and other financial instruments, but also through entering into various forms of strategic partnerships and joint ventures to be identified.
 
Should the occasion arise whereby an investor desires to fund prototype building of anyone of our technologies; we would be in a better position to demonstrate that our product works and mass-production ready. At that time, we would be able to consider marketing and distribution opportunities.
 
WE CURRENTLY DO NOT OWN ANY PATENTS OR HAVE ANY LICENSES FOR USE OF PATENTS. WE HAVE SECURED OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE LICENSES. THE BUSINESS LINES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO EXERCISE OUR OPTIONS TO SECURE LICENSURE IN THE TECHNOLOGIES. IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE THE LICENSES, ENGAGE IN PREPARATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMERICIALIZATION AND MARKETING OF THE TECHNOLOGIES LISTED BELOW WILL REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY RAISE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL.
 
The terms of our option agreement vary, but are generally described herein having range from $1,200-$5,000 to be paid as consideration for the option right. To exercise the option, we must pay between $3,500 and $5,000.,. Each option is for 1 year, and we renew any expiring options with no consideration. The options are deemed exclusive.
 
We have not yet begun negotiating the terms of a formal license, including, but not limited to, exclusivity, sublicensing, contribution of university staff and faculty in developing the commercialization of the underlying technology, costs, or rights to improvements on the underlying technology.

Medicine and Bioscience
 
Our focus in bioscience and sport medicine currently relates to four products under development: Sterilal™ self-sanitizing devices, PASS smart denture mouth guard, a handheld heart attack sensor, and a painless melanoma detection system derived from the patents we currently have options to license. We continue explore other products and methods based on our current work to develop new products and methods in the future.
Sterilal™
 
On September 11, 2019, we executed a one-year Option Agreement with the University of Florida Research Foundation, Inc. to acquire a license of certain patented technology related to self-sterilizing medical devices. The technology is described as Self-Sterilizing Device Using Plasma Fields. This self-generated plasma field provides for self-sterilization of devices used in medical procedures, drug delivery, consumer products, and food preparation and to surfaces, affording them self-sterilizing properties. The Sterilal™ product is a unique medical sterilization process technology. The self-sterilization technology utilizes plasma energy to provide self-sterilizing properties for medical devices, equipment, and surfaces. The process neutralizes contamination in seconds using a self-generated plasma field, while simultaneously minimizing risk of exposure and offering the highest levels of sterility. In July 2020, the Company entered into an amendment agreement to extend the option period to September 30, 2021 unless sooner terminated by the execution of a license agreement between the parties. All other provision of this option agreement shall remain in full force and effect and unmodified by this amendment.
 
Developed by researchers at a major Florida university, the Sterilal™ is a sterilization technique that enables medical devices to maintain a constant state of sterilization for fast, economical, and safe reuse or disposal. Built into a device itself, the self-sterilization could potentially apply to numerous medical devices such as scalpels, syringes, and catheters, as well as various surfaces that come into contact with patients and healthcare workers.
 
The Sterilal™’s self-generated plasma field offers numerous advantages over present methods of sterilization of medical devices. This self-generated plasma field allows self-sterilization of objects, apparatuses, and surfaces. As the field neutralizes contamination in seconds, it allows reuse of devices and equipment, which reduces time, costs, and inventory. The process further eliminates the need for toxic chemicals used in traditional sterilization procedures, reducing potential exposure and related hazards.
 
Flexible and adaptable, the device-specific technology can be applied to any surface of any shape or size. The plasma field utilizes inexpensive electrodes, insulators, and electro-active components that ensure easy and cost-efficient manufacturing.
 
The Sterilal™ comes as a response to the CDC’s estimated 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,200 deaths that occur in the United States each year due to some form of contamination. Once applied, the Sterilal™ can effectively self-sterilize devices used in medical procedures, drug delivery, consumer products, and food preparation affording them with self-sterilizing properties.

Technology
 
This self-generated plasma field allows self-sterilization of objects, apparatuses, and surfaces. Traditionally, plasma discharge involves placing a DC voltage potential across two electrodes. As the voltage potential gradually increases, upon reaching the breakdown voltage VB, the current and the amount of excitation of the neutral gas becomes large enough to produce visible plasma. Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) involves one dielectric-coated electrode that is typically exposed at the surface to the surrounding atmosphere, while another electrode is embedded inside a layer of insulator. University of Florida researchers have found that with special DBD arrangements, a fast reduction of viable cells by more than four orders of magnitude is possible within a few seconds, even for UV resistant cells. Thus, a self-generating plasma field is able to maintain a constant rate of sterilization when built into medical devices and surfaces.
Inexpensive, Rapid, Painless Melanoma Detection by Skin Odors to Identify Malignancy Without Biopsy
 
In August 2019, we executed a one-year Option Agreement with the University of Florida Research Foundation, Inc. to acquire a license for certain patented technology related to non-invasive melanoma detection. This inexpensive detection of the presence of melanoma is real-time and uses vapor samples, enabling inexpensive and painless diagnoses. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer: Each year, an estimated 10,000 deaths occur from the disease, and 75,000 new cases are diagnosed. Detects biomarkers specific to melanoma increasing accuracy of diagnosis. The device operates in real-time, eliminating delay. Uses vapor or other sample, making diagnosis non-invasive and painless. These methods of detecting forms of cancer, such as melanoma, analyze the chemical compounds present in a sample of air surrounding potentially cancerous tissue, without a need for prior excision of the tissue. The advantage the system is that it is portable, non-invasive detection of biomarkers specific to melanoma.
Technology
 
These methods of detecting forms of cancer, such as melanoma, analyze the chemical compounds present in a sample of air surrounding potentially cancerous tissue, without a need for prior excision of the tissue. These methods include the chemical analysis of the sample by mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, ion mobility spectrometry, or high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry. If a mole appears suspicious, a doctor can aspirate a sample of air over it. Analyzing the gas through ambient ionization and separation methods provides a spectrum of the gas specimen. In real-time, a direct analysis determines if the biomarkers for melanoma are present. This eliminates the need for the widely used “wait-and-watch” approach, as well as the need to biopsy every suspicious-looking mole, allowing more focused biopsy procedures.
 
The Company paid an option fee of $1,200 in August 2019. In August 2020, the Company entered into an amendment agreement to extend the option period to August 31, 2021 unless sooner terminated by the execution of a license agreement between the parties. All other provision of this option agreement shall remain in full force and effect and unmodified by this amendment.
 
Battery Technology
 
In March 2019, we executed a one-year Option Agreement with Florida International University to acquire a license for certain patented technology related to rapid battery charging systems. InCharge™ is a patented, compact magnetic-based energy source that not only produces energy but charges itself. As a new energy source, InCharge™ holds promise to revolutionize the global energy market, along with other energy-based applications.
 
On October 30, 2020, (the “Effective Date”) the Company entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with a University for the licensed patents related to the technology for rechargeable battery device. The term of this license shall continue until licensee permanently discontinue the sale of any licensed products or unless terminated pursuant to the terms of this agreement. Licensee may grant written sublicenses to third parties. However, the licensee shall notify the University of the initiation of the license negotiation. Licensee may terminate this agreement by giving at least sixty days written notice to University. The University may terminate this agreement by giving the licensee at least thirty days written notice upon the occurrence of certain events as defined in the agreement.

InCharge™ is revolutionary technology. It is a new type of battery, not an attachment. The device produces energy and it recharges virtually instantly. It offers a large number of cycles, a long storage time, as well as being compact in size. It will actually replace slow, rechargeable batteries.
 
The InCharge™ magnetic-based battery device provides energy yielding a large number of cycles with a long storage time. The patents for InCharge™ also demonstrate the operation of an instantly rechargeable device using a laboratory prototype.
 
We are currently determining whether we are financially capable of exercising our option, or if we will extend the option for another term.
 
Graphene
 
In November 2018, we executed a six-month Option Agreement with Florida International University to acquire a license of patented technology related to the application of graphene in de-icing planes. The option has expired, but we are in continued negotiations with the University. We are developing applications for a unique de-icing application of graphene for use in the airline industry, having intimate knowledge and understanding of the underlying technology, such that once a license is secured, the Company can immediately begin processes to begin commercialization. The new deicing application for aircraft will be enhanced by graphene, the revolutionary carbon-based nanotechnology. The 3D graphene foam−polymer composite can deice aircraft with superior deicing efficiency. The patent on the new material is pending. In October 2020, the Company entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with this licensor.
 
The Company has executed an Exclusive Distributor Agreement with Jarada, Inc. Ltd (“Jarada”) of Seoul Korea The Agreement appoints Jarada an exclusive South Korean territorial distribution rights to all of the Company’s Graphene products that will be developed and made available for worldwide commercialization. The Company shall pay Jarada 15% commission on all sales made by Jarada of the Company’s Graphene products. The term of this agreement is for two years from the date of execution and shall automatically renewed unless either party provides notice of termination.
 
The material is a highly conductive multifunctional 3D graphene foam−PDMS polymer composite, or 3D GrF for short, with high-efficiency current-induced deicing capabilities. 3D GrF is a significant technological innovation in aviation deicing. The 3D graphene-polymer composite provides electrical current-induced heating and deicing capabilities for aircraft and has demonstrated impressive thermal stability to 100 electrical loading−unloading cycles. Its application is intended to serve both the public and private sectors.

FIU’s Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering successfully fabricated and submitted a patent application for the 3D GrF at their Plasma Forming Laboratory in Miami, Florida, in 2017.
 
Graphene’s high electrical and thermal conductivity, in combination with its extremely low density, provides an intrinsic uniform electrical and thermal transport path resulting in a lightweight composite with enhanced multifunctional (electrical, thermal, and mechanical) properties to serve as active deicing components on aircraft structures. Applications of 3D GrF serve as lightweight coatings and free-standing components with heating abilities in structures operating at extremely low temperatures. The coating also increases the tensile strength of the aircraft.
 
The innovative 3D GrF deicing technology comes at a time when the aircraft deicing market is expected to experience remarkable growth in the coming years. Its development is poised to enter a $1.30 billion deicing market that is presently limited by excessive costs and toxic waste. Nations across the Northern Hemisphere such as Canada, U.S., Russia, China, U.K, Germany, Poland, France, Finland, Norway, Switzerland, and Japan among many others, are all expected to witness an upsurge in demand of aircraft deicing systems.
 
The need for deicing technology has never been greater. Adhesion of ice to the surfaces of aircraft operating in critically low-temperature conditions and inclement weather severely compromises an aircraft’s aerodynamic performance. Airport deicing operations are necessitated and performed for safety of passengers and crews, as well as to preserve the structural integrity of aircrafts. The deicing operations are time consuming, causing extensive flight delays for travelers and a heavy financial burden for the airline industry.
 
Current efforts to reduce and mitigate the ice formation in aircraft surfaces include the dispersion of chemicals, mechanical removal, and electrical heating of surfaces have inherent limitations. Besides the excessive costs and time of deicing each aircraft individually, toxic chemicals pose environmentally hazardous runoff. The chemical runoff is so hazardous, efforts to contain, cleanup and even recycle the toxic ‘spills’ after each deicing has become necessary, which adds to the excessive costs. As for electrical heating systems, though they have proven suitable for deicing, when implemented, the current-induced heating system results in high power consumption, and therefore, higher costs.
 
As industry forecasts point to excessive demand and need for improved deicing technology, FIU’s Mechanical and Materials Engineering’s 3D GrF applications provide superior deicing efficiency with the added benefit of increasing the tensile strength of the aircraft. The results are not only cost effective, but more environmentally friendly. Signet is well-positioned to further the development and commercialization of this extraordinary new deicing product enhanced by the use of graphene, the revolutionary carbon-based nanotechnology.
 
On October 30, 2020, the (“Effective Date”) the Company entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with a University for the licensed patents related to the technology for graphene foam coating and deicing. The term of this license shall continue until licensee permanently discontinue the sale of any licensed products or unless terminated pursuant to the terms of this agreement.

Arc Melted Glass Piles
 
On October 8, 2019, we executed a one-year Option Agreement with the University of South Florida Research Foundation, Inc. to acquire a license of certain patented technology described as Arc Melted Glass Piles of Structural Foundations Glass created by Arc melting process producing a compressive glass in pilings. This technology has proven critical advantages, such as increased strength yielding a SKI of 36- concrete yields 4KSI. More cost effective proving at least a 40% savings. Because of the large compressive strength of glass, the required thickness can be significantly reduced requiring smaller boreholes. Soil from the borehole can be mixed with raw material additives of sodium carbonate (soda ash) and fluxing agents, most readily available at the site. The specific advantage of using glass as a piling material is that is has the potential to provide higher strength at a very low cost that parallels less demand on our natural environment. The Company paid an option fee of $1,500 in October 2019. In October 2020, the Company entered into an amendment agreement to extend the option period to October 15, 2021. Upon exercise of this option, the Company shall pay $1,500 no later than October 15, 2021.
