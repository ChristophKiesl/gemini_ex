Item 1. Business.
Business Overview
Our most advanced products are Iomab™-B, an antibody-drug construct containing iodine 131 (I-131), used in myeloconditioning for hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (HSCT) in various indications and Actimab™-A, an antibody-drug construct containing actinium 225 (Ac-225), currently in human clinical trials for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 trial of Iomab™-B for bone marrow conditioning for HSCT in patients with relapsed or refractory AML age of 55 and older, which upon successful completion of our clinical trials we intend to submit for marketing approval. We are currently conducting a Phase 3 trial of Iomab™-B for bone marrow conditioning for HSCT in patients with relapsed or refractory AML age of 55 and older, which upon successful completion of our clinical trials, we intend to submit for marketing approval. We are currently also considering filing an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for breakthrough therapy designation for Actimab™-A and/or Iomab™-B. We are developing our cancer drugs using our expertise in radioimmunotherapy. In addition, our Ac-225 based drug development relies on the patented Alpha Particle Immunotherapy Technology (APIT) platform technology co-developed with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), who is a significant stockholder in our company. The APIT technology couples monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with extremely potent but comparatively safe alpha particle emitting radioactive isotopes, in particular actinium 225. The final drug construct is designed to specifically target and kill cancer cells while minimizing side effects. We intend to develop a number of products for different types of cancer and derive revenue from partnering relationships with large pharmaceutical companies and/or direct sales of its products in specialty markets in the United States.Business Strategy
We intend to potentially develop our most advanced clinical stage product candidates through approval in the case of Iomab™-B, and up to and including a Phase 2 proof of concept human clinical trial (a trial designed to provide data on the drug’s efficacy) in the case of Actimab™-A. If these efforts are successful, we may elect to commercialize Iomab™-B on our own or with a partner in the United States and/or outside of the United States to out-license the rights to develop and commercialize the product to a strategic partner. In the case of Actimab™-A, we will most likely seek to enter into strategic partnerships whereby the strategic partner(s) co-fund(s) further human clinical trials of the drug that are needed to obtain regulatory approvals for commercial sale within and outside of the United States. In parallel, we intend to identify and begin initial human trials with additional actinium-225 product candidates in other cancer indications. We intend to retain marketing rights for our products in the United States whenever possible and out-license marketing rights to our partners for the rest of the world. We may also seek to in license other applicable opportunities should such technology become available. 
Market Opportunity 
 We are competing in the marketplace for cancer treatments estimated to reach over $83 billion in 2016 sales, according to “The Global Use of Medicines: Outlook Through 2016 Report by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, July 2012”. While surgery, radiation and chemotherapy remain staple treatments for cancer, their use is limited by the fact that they often cause substantial damage to normal cells. On the other hand, targeted monoclonal antibody therapies exert most or all of their effect directly on cancer cells, but often lack sufficient killing power to eradicate all cancer cells with just the antibody. A new approach for treating cancer is to combine the precision of antibody-based targeting agents with the killing power of radiation or chemotherapy by attaching powerful killing agents to precise molecular carriers called monoclonal antibodies (mAb). We use mAbs labeled with radioisotopes to deliver potent doses of radiation directly to cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. The radioisotopes we use are the alpha emitter Ac-225 and the beta emitter I-131. I-131 is among the best known and well characterized radioisotopes. It is used very successfully in treatment of papillary and follicular thyroid cancer as well as other thyroid conditions. It is also attached to a monoclonal antibody in treatment of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (“NHL”). It is also used experimentally with different carriers in other cancers. Ac-225 has many unique properties and we believe we are a leader in developing this alpha emitter for clinical applications using our proprietary APIT technology. 
 Our most advanced products are Iomab™-B, I-131 labeled mAb for preparation of relapsed and refractory AML patients for HSCT; and Actimab™-A, Ac-225 labeled mAb for treatment of newly diagnosed AML, a cancer of the blood, in patients ineligible for currently approved therapies. Iomab™-B offers a potentially curative treatment for these patients, most of whom do not survive beyond a year after being diagnosed with this condition. Iomab™-B has also demonstrated efficacy in HSCT preparation for other blood cancer indications, including myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”), Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, and Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (“NHL”). These are all follow-on indications for which Iomab™-B can be developed and it is our intention to explore these opportunities at a future date. We believe the aggregate worldwide market potential for the treatment of AML, MDS, ALL, Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, multiple myeloma and NHL is approximately $4.1 billion.  
 On December 16, 2015, Company announced that the FDA cleared the Company's IND filing for Iomab-B, and that it will proceed with a pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trial. Actinium anticipates the Phase 3, controlled, randomized, pivotal trial will complete enrollment of patients by 2018 and assuming that the trial meets its end points, it will form the basis for a Biologics Licensing Application (“BLA”). The Company, in its recently approved IND filing, established an agreement with the FDA that the path to a Biologics License Application submission would include a single, pivotal Phase 3 clinical study if it is successful. The population in this two arm, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial will be refractory and relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (“AML”) patients over the age of 55. The trial size was set at 150 patients with 75 patients per arm. The primary endpoint in the pivotal Phase 3 trial is durable complete remission, defined as a complete remission lasting at least 6 months and the secondary endpoint will be overall survival at one year. There are currently no effective treatments approved by the FDA for AML in this patient population and there is no defined standard of care. Iomab-B has completed several physicians sponsored clinical trials examining its potential as a conditioning regimen prior to HSCT in various blood cancers, including the Phase 1/2 study in relapsed and/or refractory AML patients. The results of these studies in over 300 patients have demonstrated the potential of Iomab-B to create a new treatment paradigm for bone marrow transplants by: expanding the pool to ineligible patients who do not have any viable treatment options currently; enabling a shorter and safer preparatory interval for HSCT; reducing post-transplant complications; and showing a clear survival benefit including curative potential.

In September 2016, we initiated the Phase 2 clinical trial for Actimab-A. This Phase 2 clinical trial is a multicenter, open-label study that will enroll 53 patients. Patients will receive 2.0 µCi/kg/fractionated dose of Actimab-A via two injections given at day 1 and day 7. The Phase 2 trial is designed to evaluate complete response rates at up to day 42 after Actimab-A administration, where complete response is defined as complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp). A formal interim analysis is expected to occur in mid-2017 with topline results expected in the second half of 2017. The Phase 2 clinical trial includes peripheral blast burden as an inclusion criteria and in patients with high peripheral blast (PB) burden, the use of Hydroxyurea will be mandated with the goal of bringing PB burden below a key threshold number that we have identified from two previously complete Phase 1 clinical trials totaling 38 patients. In addition, the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (GCSF) will be mandated. Low dose cytarabine has been eliminated from the protocol and the Phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate Actimab-A as a monotherapy. The secondary endpoint of the Phase 2 clinical trial will be overall survival.
 
In February 2017, we initiated a Phase 1 investigator initiated clinical trial to study Actimab-M in multiple myeloma (MM). Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells that is currently incurable. The Phase 1 trial will enroll up to 12 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have positive CD33 expression. This Phase 1 study is designed as a dose escalation study intended to assess safety, establish maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and assess efficacy. Patients will be administered Actimab-M on day 1 at an initial dose of 0.5 µCi/kg and then assessed at day 42 for safety and efficacy. The dose can be increased to 1.0 µCi/kg or reduced to 0.25 µCi/kg based on safety assessment that will evaluate dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). Patients may receive up to 8 cycles of therapy but in no event will cumulative administration exceed 4.0 µCi/kg of Actimab-M.
 
Other potential product opportunities in which significant preclinical work is being undertaken include metastatic colorectal cancer, metastatic prostate cancer and antiangiogenesis which reduces the blood supply to solid tumors. We believe the worldwide market potential for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer is approximately $4.8 billion, and we believe the worldwide market potential for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer is approximately $6.0 billion. We also believe the worldwide market potential for the treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme, a potential indication based on an antiangiogenesis approach, is approximately $1.1 billion. We estimate the market potential for these indications based on company research published rates of disease incidence and company calculations based on costs of currently used therapies.
 
We believe that our biggest market opportunity lies in the applicability of our APIT platform technology to a wide variety of cancers. A broad range of solid and blood borne cancers can be potentially targeted by mAbs to enable treatment with the APIT technology. The APIT technology could potentially be applied to mAbs that are already approved by the FDA to create more efficacious and/or safer drugs (“biobetters”).
 
In March 2016, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for Ioamb-B and in October 2016 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted orphan designation in the European Union (EU) for Iomab-B. In November 2014, the FDA granted orphan-drug designation for Actimab™-A and in December 2016 we submitted an application to the EMA for orphan designation in the EU for Actimab-A. The FDA, through its Office of Orphan Products Development, grants orphan status to drugs and biologic products that are intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan drug designation provides a drug developer with certain benefits and incentives, including a period of marketing exclusivity if regulatory approval is ultimately received for the designated indication; potential tax credits on United States clinical trials; eligibility for orphan drug grants; and waiver of certain administrative fees. The EMA, through its Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP), examines applications for orphan designation. To qualify for orphan designation, the prevalence of the condition must be less than 5 in 10,000, it must be life threatening or chronically debilitating and there must be no satisfactory method of treating the condition. Sponsors who obtain orphan designation receive numerous incentives including protocol assistance, a reduction or waving of fees and 10 years of market exclusivity should the therapy be approved. The process of filing and receiving the orphan medicines designation can take between eight to fourteen months in most cases.
 
Our Corporate History and Background
 
 We were formed as a Nevada corporation on October 6, 1997, originally under the name Zurich U.S.A., Inc. On July 10, 2006, we changed our name to Cactus Ventures, Inc. and began pursuing our business of marketing sunglasses. The Company encountered numerous problems with various vendors and ceased its operations. The Company shifted its efforts to seeking a business combination opportunity with a business entity, and negotiated a merger of a target company into the Company.  Upon ceasing its operations, the Company was considered a “blank check” or “Shell” company as such term is defined under the Securities Act. Upon completing the Share Exchange (as defined below), the Company ceased being considered a “blank check” or “Shell” company and is now a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing certain cancer treatments.
 
On April 11, 2013, the change of domicile from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware and the change of Cactus Ventures, Inc.’s name from Cactus Ventures, Inc. to Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. became effective in accordance with Articles of Merger filed with the State of Nevada and a Certificate of Merger filed with the State of Delaware.  In connection with the name change we also changed (i) the name of our subsidiary Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to Actinium Corporation, (ii) our par value to $0.001 per share, and (iii) the number of authorized shares of preferred stock to 10 million shares. Effective April 18, 2013 our new trading symbol became ATNM. On September 25, 2013, we merged with our subsidiary, Actinium Corporation.  In January 2014, we increased our authorized shares of common stock to 200 million shares and our authorized shares of preferred stock to 50 million shares.

Acquisition of Actinium
 
On December 28, 2012, Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Actinium”) completed a share exchange with Cactus, whereby Cactus acquired 21% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Actinium Corporation from the shareholders of Actinium Corporation in exchange for the issuance of 4,333,489 shares of Common Stock of the Company to the Actinium shareholders. As part of the share exchange, Actinium Corporation paid $250,000 to the shareholders of Cactus before the consummation of the share exchange.
 
The share exchange was treated as a recapitalization effected through a share exchange, with Actinium Corporation as the accounting acquirer and the Company the accounting acquiree.  Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this Report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the share exchange, we are referring to the business and financial information of Actinium Corporation.
 
As a result of the share exchange, the Company assumed the business and operations of Actinium Corporation. On April 11, 2013, the change of domicile from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware and the change of Cactus Ventures, Inc.’s name from Cactus Ventures, Inc. to Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. became effective in accordance with Articles of Merger filed with the State of Nevada and a Certificate of Merger filed with the State of Delaware.
 
As we are a “reporting company” under the Exchange Act of 1934, it is required to file periodic filings with the SEC.
 
On March 11, 2013, Actinium Corporation continued its share exchange with the Company, whereby we acquired an additional 36% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Actinium Corporation from the Actinium Corporation shareholders in exchange for the issuance of 7,756,840 shares of Common Stock of the Company to the Actinium Shareholders.  On August 22, 2013, Actinium Corporation continued its share exchange with the Company, whereby the Company acquired an additional 30.4% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Actinium Corporation from the Actinium Corporation shareholders in exchange for the issuance of 6,383,475 shares of Common Stock of the Company to the Actinium Shareholders.  On September 25, 2013 in accordance with a Certificate of Ownership Merging Actinium Corporation into the Company, the Company merged into itself Actinium Corporation, and Actinium Corporation ceased to exist. As a result of the merger, Actinium Corporation stock owned by the Company has been cancelled and each share of Actinium Corporation not owned by the Company was exchanged for 0.333 shares of Company common stock.

We have obtained FDA’s comment and guidance on the Iomab™-B Phase 3 clinical trial design, and the FDA has identified the following design features as generally acceptable, dependent on the results of the trial:
 

— | Single pivotal study, pending trial results; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
— | Patient population: refractory AML patients age of 55 and older, where refractory is defined as either primary failure to achieve a complete remission after 2 cycles of induction therapy; relapsed after 6 months in complete remission; second or higher relapse; or relapsed disease not responding to intensive salvage therapy; 
— | Trial arms: study arm and control arm with physician’s choice of conventional care with curative intent; and 
— | Trial size: 150 patients total (75 patients per arm). 

 
Actimab™-A
 
Actimab™-A is currently in the Phase 2 portion of a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial in AML. It consists of the monoclonal antibody Lintuzumab and alpha emitting radioisotope actinium 225 (Ac-225). The indication in the ongoing trial is newly diagnosed AML patients over the age of 60.
 
Previous clinical trials leading to this trial included:
 

— | Phase 1 clinical trial with Bismab-A, the first generation product consisting of the same monoclonal antibody Lintuzumab and Bi-213 alpha emitter, a daughter of Ac-225; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
— | Phase 1/2 clinical trial with Bismab-A, the first generation product consisting of the same monoclonal antibody Lintuzumab and Bi-213 alpha emitter, a daughter of Ac-225; and 
— | Dose escalating pilot Phase 1 clinical trial with Actimab™-A, the current product consisting of the Lintuzumab monoclonal antibody and Ac-225 alpha emitter. 

 
Completed Actimab™-A related clinical trials outcomes:
 

— | The Phase 2 arm of the Bismab-A drug study has shown signs of the drug’s efficacy and safety, including reduction in peripheral blast counts and complete responses in some patients. Bi-213 is a daughter, i.e., product of the degradation of Ac-225, with cancer cell killing properties similar to Ac-225 but is less potent. The Phase 1 Actimab™-A trial at MSKCC with a single-dose administration of Actimab™-A showed elimination of leukemia cells from blood in 67% of all evaluable patients who received a full dose and in 83% of those treated at dose levels above 0.5 microcuries per kilogram (µCi/kg), and eradication of leukemia cells in both blood and bone marrow in 20% of all evaluable patients and 25% of those treated at dose levels above 0.5 µCi/kg. Maximum tolerated single dose in this trial was established at 3 µCi/kg. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
High potency means that a relatively low amount of drug is needed to produce a given effect. In preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies, Actimab-A (225Ac-lintuzumab) has demonstrated at least 500-1000 times higher potency than the first-generation predecessor (213Bi-lintuzumab) upon which it is based. This difference is due to intrinsic physicochemical properties of Actimab-A that were first established in vitro, in which Actimab-A killed multiple cell lines at doses at least 1000 times lower (based on LD50 values) than Bismab-A analogs. Key factors in Actimab-A’s higher potency are the yield of 4 alpha-emitting isotopes per 225Ac (compared to 1 alpha decay for bismuth 213) and much longer half-life (10 day for 225Ac vs 46 minutes for 213Bi).

In preclinical animal models, doses in the nanocurie range prolonged survival. In humans, Actimab-A was previously studied in a Phase I monotherapy trial of relapsed or refractory AML patients at MSKCC. Dose levels in that study re-confirmed the substantially higher potency of Actimab-A, as compared to equivalent dosing of the first-generation Bismab-A (213Bi-lintuzumab) construct, which had nevertheless established safety and efficacy in a Phase 1/2 trial in high-risk AML with cytoreduction.

Ongoing Actimab™-A trial:
 
We have completed the Phase 1 portion of our first company sponsored Phase 1/2 multi-center trial with fractionated (two) doses of Actimab™-A, for the treatment of patients newly diagnosed with AML over the age of 60. Actimab-A consists of an AML specific monoclonal antibody (HuM195, also known as Lintuzumab™) and the actinium 225 radioactive isotope attached to it. Results from the Phase 1 portion of the trial showed that 28% (5 of 18) of patients had objective responses (2CR, 1CRp and 2 Cri (complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery)) with median response duration of 9.1 months. Mean bone marrow blast reduction amongst evaluable patients (14 of 18) was 67% with 57% of patients having bone marrow blast reduction of 50% or greater and 79% (11 of 14) of patients having bone marrow blast reductions after Cycle 1 of therapy. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached in this trial. We have elected to progress to the Phase 2 portion of the trial at 2.0 μCi/kg/fraction, the highest dose level from the Phase 1 portion of the trial.
 
The Phase 2 portion of the trial will enroll 53 patients and will study Actimab-A as a monotherapy. The Company received agreement from the FDA for multiple revisions to the trial protocol for the Phase 2 portion of the trial that include:
 

- | Removing the use of low dose cytarabine from the Phase 2 protocol, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Stipulating Peripheral blast burden as an inclusion criteria with 200 ML being the threshold 
- | Mandating the use of hydroxyurea in patients with peripheral blast count above 200 ML to lower their peripheral blasts below 200ML/ prior to Actimab-A administration 
- | Mandating the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) support 

 
Bismab-A trials and the Phase 1 Actimab™-A trial were focused on relapsed, refractory and other difficult to treat acute myeloid leukemia patients. The current multicenter Phase 1/2 trial is focused on newly diagnosed AML patients who have historically had better outcomes.
 
Actimab-M
 
Actimab-M is comprised of the anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody HuM-195 coupled to actinium 225, an alpha-particle emitting radioisotope, and is the same construct of Actinium’s Actimab-A, which is currently being studied in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are over the age of 60. The Phase 1 trial for Actimab-M is an, open label, dose-escalation study. Patients will be administered a starting dose level of 0.5 μCi/Kg of Actimab-M via infusion on day 1 of each cycle for up to 8 cycles with each cycle lasting 42 days. If this dose level is deemed safe, a second dose level of 1.0 μCi/kg will be explored for up to 4 cycles also of 42 days per cycle. Total dose received per patient is not to exceed 4.0 μCi/kg. In the event of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at the 0.5 μCi/Kg dose level, a dose level of 0.25 μCi/Kg will be explored. The Phase 1 trial will estimate maximum tolerated dose (MTD), assess adverse events, measure response rates (objective response rate, complete response rate, stringent complete response rate, very good partial response rate and partial response rate) as well as progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
 
Operations
 
Our current operations are primarily focused on furthering the development of our lead clinical drug candidates Iomab™-B and Actimab™-A, supporting investigator initiated clinical trials that use our drug candidates and leveraging our alpha particle immunotherapy technology platform to create new clinical programs.
 
Operations related to Iomab™-B include progressing the ongoing multi-center Phase 3 pivotal trial (a trial that leads to registration trial marketing approved by the FDA) which include investigator engagement, site activation and supporting patient enrollment. In addition, we are focused on commercial scale manufacturing suitable for an approval trial and preparation of appropriate regulatory submissions.
 
In the case of Actimab-M and Actimab™-A respectively, key ongoing activities include progressing the ongoing investigator sponsored Phase 1 and multi-center Phase 2 portions of our trials, managing isotope and other materials supply chain, and managing the manufacturing of the finished drug candidate product. We have secured access to much of the currently available world reserves of Ac-225 and Bi-213 through a renewable contractual arrangement with the United States Department of Energy (DOE). We project that these quantities are sufficient to support early stages of commercialization of alpha isotopes based products. The Company has also developed its own proprietary process for industrial scale Ac-225 production in a cyclotron in quantities adequate to support full product commercialization.

For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred approximately $17.5 million, $13.3 million and $12.3 million, respectively, on research and development activities.  These expenditures consisted of materials maintenance and purchases, supply chain development and implementation, drug candidate manufacturing expenditures, clinical trials costs and intellectual property portfolio related expenses. None of the costs of such research and development activities were borne by customers. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our net loss was approximately $24.3 million, $21.0 million and $24.7 million, respectively.
 
Failure to raise additional equity or debt funding in the amounts necessary to complete our programs and/or failure to out license our programs on the projected terms may result in a delay of our projected development plan or our inability to complete one or more of the planned programs.

Intellectual Property Portfolio
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have developed or in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of our products. In the past year, the Company has strengthened its IP positioning with the allowance of three additional patents and further allowances are anticipated in 2017. As of March 10, 2017 our patent portfolio includes: 61 issued and pending patents, of which 10 are issued in the United States, 50 are issued or pending internationally, and 1 is pending in the United States. Additionally, several non-provisional patent applications are expected to be filed in 2017 based on provisional patent applications filed in 2016. This is part of an ongoing strategy to continue to strengthen the company’s IP position. About half of our patents are in-licensed from third parties and half are held by us. These patents cover key areas of our business, including use of the actinium-225 and other alpha emitting isotopes attached to cancer specific carriers like monoclonal antibodies, methods for manufacturing key components of our product candidates including actinium-225 alpha emitting radioisotope and carrier antibodies, and methods for manufacturing finished product candidates for use in cancer treatment. The table below classifies these patents by related family:

A patent whose claims address methods of treating hematopoietic malignancies with Iomab™-B is pending; still, we have developed a proprietary strategy based on trade secret protection and the potential for orphan drug and data exclusivities. The BC8 antibody, cell line and related know-how has been exclusively licensed by us from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) in exchange for milestones, royalties and research support.
 
Patents related to the antibody component of Actimab-A have been exclusively licensed by us from AbbVie Biotherapeutics Corp. for use with alpha-emitting radioisotopes in exchange for future development and commercialization milestones, a royalty on net sales for a period of 12.5 years from first commercial sale, a negotiation right to be our clinical and/or commercial antibody supplier, a negotiation right to co-promote Actimab™-A in the United States on terms to be negotiated, and the grant-back of IP rights covering improvements to the antibody for use other than with an alpha-emitting isotope. Patents covering actinium-225 conjugated to antibodies have been exclusively licensed by us from MSKCC in exchange for license fees, research support payments, development milestones, 2% royalties on net sales for the term of the licensed patents or, if later, 10 years from first commercial sale, and 15% of any sublicense income we may receive. We source actinium-225 under an agreement with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) that expires at the end of 2017. We believe, but cannot guarantee, that we will be able to renew this contract for additional annual periods.
 
The sale of securities by us in any equity or debt financing could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and have a material adverse effect on our earnings.
 
We believe that the key elements for our market success include:
 

● | Clinical results to date could imply lower development risk for its lead drug candidates: Our lead drug candidates have been tested in over 300 patients and demonstrated favorable safety and efficacy profiles. Iomab™-B has been administered to more than 300 patients with leukemia in a number of Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials and has shown a clear survival benefit in the indication for which it is being developed. Bismab®-A and Actimab™-A, drugs based on the APIT platform have to date been tested in almost 90 patients in 4 clinical trials. In each trial they exhibited few side effects and have shown indications of efficacy. The current proof-of-concept Actimab™-A Phase 1/2 clinical trial is directed at a patient population that is generally easier to treat (newly diagnosed vs. relapsed/refractory in previous trials), and employs a more potent treatment regimen (two doses of Actimab™-A vs. a single dose of Actimab™-A in the physician sponsored trial). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Additional product opportunities from the APIT platform: Our APIT technology has the potential for broad applicability for the treatment of many cancer types, which allows us to add new product candidates to its pipeline based on well-defined patent protected methods. 
● | Collaboration with MSKCC: Our collaboration with MSKCC includes licensing, research and clinical trial arrangements involving MSKCC labs and clinicians and included financial support with respect to certain pre-2012 R&D-related expenses. 
● | Scientific backing of leading experts: Our clinical advisory board and collaborators include some of the most recognized clinicians and scientists working at some of the highest regarded medical institutions in the United States and the world, including MSKCC, Johns Hopkins University, University of Pennsylvania, FHCC and MD Anderson Cancer Center. This is expected to be beneficial to us both in clinical development and market acceptance assuming its drug candidates are approved. 
● | Isotope supply secured for clinical trials: We have a contractual relationship with ORNL of the DOE that provides us access to the largest known supply reserves of actinium 225. Iodine 131 is readily available from a number of qualified pharmaceutical supply vendors. 


● | Proprietary alpha emitting isotope manufacturing technology fully developed: We have developed our own proprietary technology for commercial scale manufacturing of actinium 225. This is expected to ensure commercial supply of Ac-225 for Actimab™-A, Actimab™-B and other actinium-linked products should they be approved. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | cGMP Actimab™-A manufacturing developed: We have developed at a contractor’s site full cGMP (current good manufacturing practices) manufacturing processes for our drug candidate Actimab™-A. 
● | Substantial IP portfolio: We have an intellectual property portfolio in excess of 60 patents and patent applications, both in the United States and other countries, which cover clinical applications of the APIT technology and methods of manufacturing actinium 225 thus giving us control over both the applications of our technology and a supply chain of our key ingredients, actinium 225 and bismuth 213 alpha emitting isotopes.

Competition Overview
 
To our knowledge, there are no other commercial entities that have significant clinical programs in place for developing Ac-225- or Bi-213-based drugs. In the wider field of medical oncology, we face competition from: developers of other alpha emitter based drug candidates, other radioimmunotherapy based technologies, technologies for labeling antibodies with toxic drugs (antibody-drug conjugates), and for each disease indication from all drugs available and/or in development.
 
For our lead indication, acute myeloid leukemia, there are a number of companies developing drugs for AML. These drugs are most often small molecules and as such have different safety profiles and mechanisms of action compared to our drug candidates.  Acute myeloid leukemia in older patients remains an area of high medical need that could accommodate many new products with favorable safety and efficiency profiles.
 
In the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, pharmaceuticals currently used for bone marrow ablation/conditioning are generic drugs and to our knowledge there are no significant industry efforts to advance clinical programs in this area that are directly competitive, especially in older patients.
 
Government Regulation
 
Governmental authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing of radioimmunotherapy pharmaceutical products such as those being developed by us. In the United States, the FDA regulates such products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and implements regulations. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation
 
Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Most notably, all of our products that may in the future be sold in the United States are subject to regulation by the FDA. Certain of our product candidates in the United States require FDA pre-marketing approval of a BLA pursuant to 21 C.F.R. § 314. Foreign countries may require similar or more onerous approvals to manufacture or market these products.
 
Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or other regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions, including but not limited to, untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products; operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing or delaying our requests for BLA premarket approval of new products or modified products; withdrawing BLA approvals that have already been granted; and refusal to grant export.
 
Employees
 
As of March 15, 2017, we have 23 full-time employees. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. We also engage consultants on an as-needed basis to supplement existing staff.
