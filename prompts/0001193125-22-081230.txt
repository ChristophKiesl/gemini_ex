ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Company 
 We were incorporated on September 11, 2020, as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effectuating a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar partnering transaction with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Report as our “partnering transaction.” We may pursue a partnering transaction in any business or industry but expect to focus on a business where we believe our strong network, operational background, and aligned economic structure provides us with a competitive advantage. 
 Sanjeev Mehra co-founded Periphas Capital in 2017, following a thirty-one year career at Goldman, Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs” or “GS”), where Mr. Mehra was a founding member of Goldman Sachs’ Principal Investment Area (“PIA”), the firm’s private investing arm of its Merchant Banking Division (“MBD”). Periphas Capital and its principals bring over 30 years of private investing experience. Over the course of their careers, the Periphas Capital team has led the investment of over $4.8 billion of equity in 37 companies, representing approximately $70 billion of enterprise value. Moreover, the Periphas Capital team has approved and overseen approximately $100 billion of capital deployment. Importantly, the team has generated attractive returns over multiple cycles and brings a long-term approach to investing. 
 Our team shares a common set of values based on integrity, collaboration, and disciplined, analytical decision making. We seek to partner with management teams to create stockholder value over the long term by growing and improving the businesses we invest in. We also bring a differentiated blend of industry expertise, strategic insight and operational focus. We aspire to be diligent stewards of capital for investors and long-term capital partners to business owners, founders, families and management teams. 
 Operating Partner Model 
 We intend to employ an operating partner model with respect to our partnering transaction: 
 Periphas Capital’s Relationship with Operating Partners. Our principals have an extensive network of operating executive relationships from prior investments and industry experience, and our Company has partnered with a group of five former CEOs across our target sectors (the “operating partners”). The principals of Periphas Capital have over a decade–long relationship with each of the five operating partners. 
 Role of Operating Partners. All five of the operating partners play a key role in working with Periphas Capital to source and evaluate investment opportunities within their respective domains of expertise. We anticipate that the operating partner(s) whose area of expertise most closely overlaps with the ultimate partnering candidate will play an ongoing role in overseeing the company for several years post-closing. 
 Economic Alignment of the Operating Partners. Each of the five operating partners is investing in the sponsor and receiving significant economic interest in CAPSTM, founder shares, and performance shares. In addition, we reserved a substantial portion of Performance Shares to reinforce strong incentives and long term alignment. We expect to allocate such Performance Shares to the operating partner(s) most active in the partner company we combine with. 
 Mindset of our Operating Partners. Our operating partners recognize that it takes time to build a market-leading company and intend to take a partnership approach with each company situation. We do not intend to take a “replacement” “buyout” or “activist” approach. Hence, we have termed our “initial business combination” with a potential company as a “partnering transaction” and the potential company as the “partner company” or “partnering candidate” rather than “target company.” We will seek to partner with existing management and owners, and work together from an operational perspective over the long term. 
 Our Operating Partners. Our five operating partners include the following individuals: 
 
4 

  Brian T. Clingen. Mr. Clingen is the Founder and Managing Partner of BP Capital Management.

  Business Strategy 
 Our objective is to generate attractive returns to common stockholders post-closing of the merger transaction by partnering with a company where we can grow both revenues and operating earnings. We are focused on working with companies that are high-quality, public-company ready and could leverage the strategic experience of our management team and Periphas Capital, as well as our Company’s differentiated structure. 
 Our selection process leverages our management team’s and Periphas Capital’s network of industry, private equity sponsor, credit fund sponsor and lending community relationships as well as relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, and other advisors, which we believe should provide us with a number of partnering transaction opportunities. We intend to deploy a proactive, thematic sourcing strategy and to focus on companies where we believe the combination of our operating experience, relationships, capital and capital markets expertise could be catalysts to transform a partnering candidate and can help accelerate its growth and performance. Upon completion of our initial public offering, our principals and operating partners communicate with our network of relationships to articulate our partnering criteria, including the parameters of our search for a company to partner with, and began the disciplined process of qualifying, reviewing, and pursuing promising leads. 
 Our strategy is characterized by: 
 A focused, thesis-driven approach to capitalize on key technological, industry, and social trends in our four target areas: technology-enabled businesses, business services, industrials, and consumer. 
 Thematic targeting of specific business models and sectors based on pattern recognition from dozens of prior investments and significant industry experience. 
 Leveraging our Operating Partner model by working with our five operating partners, each of whom have more than a decade-long relationship with principals of Periphas Capital. The operating partners play a key role in identifying, evaluating, and adding value to potential partnering candidates (see “—Operating Partner Model” above for further detail). 
 Focusing on growth oriented companies with visible, sustainable, and profitable growth opportunities (see “—Investment Criteria” below for further detail). 
 Emphasizing technology enablement where technology can be used to: (1) enhance the value proposition and accelerate top-line growth; and (2) streamline the cost structure to further boost bottom-line growth. 
 Proactively sourcing deals through bilateral negotiations or situations where Periphas Capital has a value-added angle. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 The sourcing, valuation, diligence and execution capabilities of the Periphas Capital team provides us with a significant pipeline of opportunities from which to evaluate and select a business that benefits from our expertise. Our competitive strengths include the following core elements: 
 Deep Investing Experience and Attractive Track Record: The principals of Periphas Capital have over 30 years of investing experience, have led dozens of private equity investments, have approved and overseen approximately $100 billion of capital deployment, and have generated attractive returns consistently over multiple economic cycles. 
 Operating Partners Offer Proprietary Sourcing and Value Creation Capabilities: Our operating partners have attractive track records in growing and nurturing businesses over the long term. In addition, many of them have led public companies and have generated impressive stockholder returns. Importantly, the principals of Periphas Capital have over a decade-long relationship with each of the operating partners. We expect the involvement of our operating partners to be attractive to potential partnering candidates. Their involvement could also lead to proprietary conversations with respect to sourcing. Their on-going involvement after closing of the partnering transaction could also help unlock significant future value. 
 
6 

  History of Value Creation Driven by Growth: We believe that our experience and history in generating returns by growing both the top and bottom line, and by positioning companies for continued long-term growth will serve us well in prioritizing businesses to target. 
 Significant Experience in “Tech-Enabling” Businesses: We have invested in and supported the tech-enablement of companies in several industries in the past. We have also guided companies through the development and adoption of technologies that evolved into core competitive advantages. 
 Deep and Successful Track Record of Taking Private Companies Public: The Periphas Capital team has a track record of successfully taking private companies public and driving value creation in the public markets, including with such companies as KAR Auction Services, Inc.; Nalco Company; Burger King Holdings, Inc.; Aramark; and Great Plains Software, Inc. 
 Private Equity Relationships Translating to Proprietary Sourcing: The Periphas Capital team has deep relationships with the world’s leading private equity firms. Because of the trust and mutual respect associated with these relationships, we expect to be able to engage in proprietary discussions with owners of several potential partnering candidates. 
 Deep Relationships with Family-Owned Businesses, Large Corporations, and Entrepreneurs: The Periphas Capital team also has an extensive network of close relationships with family-owned businesses, large corporations, and entrepreneurs. This offers an attractive and proprietary pool of potential investment candidates in addition to private equity-backed companies. Moreover, these relationships offer Periphas Capital unique capabilities in evaluating and ultimately adding significant value to whichever partnering candidate we merge with. 
 Relationships with Other Operating Executives: In addition to our operating partners, we have an extensive network of other operating executive relationships built over decades of investing. These relationships can serve as functional and industry experts, as sources of introduction, and potentially as executive advisors who can add value post the partnering transaction. 
 CAPSTM Structure Creates Incentive Alignment: The CAPSTM structure provides alignment between Periphas Capital, our public investors, and the existing owners of the partnering candidate. 
 Lower Dilution as Compared to a Traditional SPAC Structure: We believe that the CAPSTM structure is more economically efficient to our partner candidate, as compared to a traditional special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) since it results in potentially lower dilution at the time of the partnering transaction. Hence, we believe that the CAPSTM structure will make us more appealing to a partnering candidate as opposed to a traditional SPAC. 
 Focus on Sustainable, Long-Term Value Creation: Periphas Capital focuses on creating value over the long-term. The CAPSTM incentive structure rewards sustainable value generation over multiple years rather than rewarding a sponsor simply for completing a transaction. 
 Experience in Capital Markets and Structuring: We have experience in optimizing capital structures in a manner that is consistent with companies’ business plans, and providing access to low-cost capital while preserving financial flexibility and minimizing risk. 
 Periphas Capital “Value-Add” Playbook: We intend to use the Periphas Capital value-add playbook through each stage of our partnering transaction, which we believe can drive significant stockholder value. The playbook includes the following: 
 
7 

  At Entry. At the beginning stages, we conduct detailed diligence on the business, leveraging experienced management and advisors who have an existing relationship with Periphas Capital. We benchmark key operating metrics of the partnering candidate against best-in-class competitors, while focusing on investing in segments with attractive growth, profitability and returns on capital. We also look to create a capital structure that optimizes the cost of capital while minimizing risk and preserving flexibility for future investment. In partnership with management, we create a detailed value creation plan that typically extends 3-5 years out and forms the basis on where to allocate capital and management resources. 
 Growth and Operational Efficiencies. We drive growth by finding and prioritizing high-return opportunities to re-invest cash flows, using technology as an enabler to improve capabilities, reducing costs, and innovating. We critically evaluate management teams, aggressively recruit/retain talent, and implement succession planning strategies, focusing incentive systems for management on key value drivers and key performance indicators (“KPIs”). We also seek to standardize key processes to improve efficiency, which means exiting marginal business units and instead driving growth in core focus areas. 
 Public Markets Management. We seek to build a business plan that can be communicated to public investors, while preparing management to deliver the message at meetings, on conference calls, and at “Investor Day” presentations. We also regularly evaluate whether M&A or strategic combinations can create value for stockholders, as well as what capital markets transactions can reduce the company’s cost of capital. 
Investment Criteria 
 We have developed the following high level, non-exclusive investment criteria that we use to screen for and evaluate a partnering candidate. 
 Size Range: We are focused on companies whose enterprise values are greater than $750 million and could be up to several billion dollars. Geographic Focus: We are focused on North American or multi-national companies. 
 Target Sectors: We are focused on companies operating in one of four areas: technology-enabled businesses, business services, industrials, and consumer. 
 Sustainable Long-Term Growth: We will seek to partner with a business with attractive long-term organic growth as well as the potential for modest consolidation growth opportunities. We are focused on growth which is predictable and durable through cycles, with manageable risks. 
 Ability to Use Technology as a Differentiator: We believe that technology can be used “on offense” to boost company efficiencies, including both growth and profitability. We also believe that technology can be used “on defense” to protect against potential competitive and market threats. 
 Attractive Industry Structure: We will seek to partner with a business that has attractive long term dynamics around supply and demand, as well as a stable industry structure. 
 Competitive Differentiation and Leading Market Position: We will seek to partner with a business whose products or services have defensible competitive advantages versus existing and new competitors, as well as leading market positions. 
 Attractive Financial Profile: We will seek to partner with a business that has the ability to earn attractive profits and returns on capital that are well in excess of its cost of capital. 
 Strong Management and a Culture of Partnership: Our team and operating advisors will seek to partner with strong and capable management teams who see value in partnering with Periphas Capital. 
 Periphas Capital Ability to Add Value: We will seek to partner with a business which is within Periphas Capital’s or our operating partners’ areas of expertise, and where Periphas Capital can help the business and its management team create value in the future. 
 
8 

   Differentiated Relationship with Seller: We will seek to partner with an existing owner of a business with whom Periphas Capital has a relationship that enables a proprietary dialogue. 
 Attractive Valuation: We will want to ensure that the valuation reflects the company’s underlying risk and return potential and that it is attractive relative to comparable public companies. 
 Public Company Ready: We will focus on companies which have “public company-ready” business plans and financials that can be clearly communicated to and understood by public investors. 
 These criteria are guidelines and not intended to be exhaustive, and the partnering transaction we deem most attractive may not satisfy certain of these criteria. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular partnering transaction may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our partnering transaction with a partnering candidate that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the partnering candidate does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our partnering transaction, which, as discussed in this Report, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). 
 Conflicts of Interest We are not prohibited from pursuing a partnering transaction with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, our officers or our directors. In the event we seek to complete our partnering transaction with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our officers or our directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from an independent accounting firm, that such a partnering transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 
 Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own our securities following our initial public offering and, accordingly, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a partnering candidate is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our partnering transaction. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular partnering transaction if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a partnering candidate as a condition to any agreement with respect to our partnering transaction. 
 Periphas Capital manages several investment vehicles. Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity, including public and private funds under the management of Periphas Capital and its respective portfolio companies, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a partnering transaction opportunity to such entity. In addition, existing and future funds managed by Periphas Capital and its respective portfolio companies may compete with us for partnering transaction opportunities and, if such opportunities are pursued by such entities, we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a partnering transaction opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such partnering transaction opportunity to such entity, and may only decide to present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity and consummating the same would not violate any restrictive covenants to which such officers and directors are subject. 
 While our sponsor and its affiliates do not have any duty to offer acquisition opportunities to us, our sponsor and its affiliates may become aware of a potential transaction that is an attractive opportunity for us, which it may decide to share with us. Conflicts may arise from Periphas Capital’s involvement with our company, as well as from actions undertaken by Periphas Capital or any of its affiliates for their own account. When acting for their own account, Periphas Capital or any of its affiliates may take commercial steps which may have an adverse effect on us. Any of Periphas Capital’s or its affiliates’ other activities may, individually or in the aggregate, have an adverse effect on us, and the interests of Periphas Capital or any of its affiliates may at times be averse to ours. 
 We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties of our officers or directors, or our sponsor and its affiliates, materially affect our ability to complete our partnering transaction.

  Partnering Transaction 
 The NYSE rules require that our initial partnering transaction must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted). We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the partnering candidate or candidates, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. As any such opinion, if obtained, would only state that the fair market value meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of the partnering candidate or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our stockholders. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make such independent determination of fair market value, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular partnering candidate or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the partnering candidate’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board of directors determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. As any such opinion, if obtained, would only state that the fair market value meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of the partnering candidate or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our stockholders. 
 We anticipate structuring our partnering transaction so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders’ own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the partnering candidate or candidates. We may, however, structure our partnering transaction such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the partnering candidate in order to meet certain objectives of the partnering candidate management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such partnering transaction if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the partnering candidate or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the partnering candidate sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the partnering candidate, our stockholders prior to our partnering transaction may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the partnering candidate and us in our partnering transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all the outstanding capital stock of a partnering candidate. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the partnering candidate. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our partnering transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our partnering transaction. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a partnering candidate or candidates are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our partnering transaction involves more than one partnering candidate, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all the partnering candidates. 
 We filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our partnering transaction. 
 We may pursue a partnering transaction opportunity jointly with our sponsor, Periphas Capital or one or more of its affiliates and/or investors in Periphas Capital or one of its affiliates. Any such parties may co-invest with us in the partnering candidate at the time of our partnering transaction, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities. Any such issuance of equity or equity-linked securities would, on a fully diluted basis, reduce the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our founder shares, issuances or deemed issuances of shares of Class A Common Stock or equity-linked securities would result in an adjustment to the ratio at which founder shares shall convert into shares of Class A Common Stock such that our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 5% of the sum of the total 
 
10 

  number of all shares of as-converted Class A Common Stock outstanding upon completion of our initial public offering (including the private placement shares), plus all shares of Class A Common Stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the partnering transaction, unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding founder shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to such issuance or deemed issuance at the time thereof. Neither our sponsor nor Periphas Capital, nor any of their respective affiliates, have an obligation to make any such investment, and may compete with us for potential partnering transactions. 
 Status as a Public Company 
 We believe our structure will make us an attractive partnering transaction partner to partnering candidates. As an existing public company, we offer a partnering candidate an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other partnering transaction with us. In a partnering transaction with us, the owners of the partnering candidate may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the partnering candidate for shares of our Class A Common Stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of shares of our Class A Common Stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe partnering candidates will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical partnering transaction process, and there are significant expenses and market and other uncertainties in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a partnering transaction with us. 
 Furthermore, once a proposed partnering transaction is completed, the partnering candidate will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriter’s ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following a partnering transaction, we believe the partnering candidate would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 
 While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential partnering candidates may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed partnering transaction, negatively. 
 Financial Position 
 With funds available for a partnering transaction initially in the amount of $414,000,000 (assuming no redemptions), we offer a partnering candidate a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our partnering transaction using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the partnering candidate to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 
Effectuating Our Partnering Transaction 
 General 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following our initial public offering. We intend to effectuate our partnering transaction using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement CAPSTM, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our partnering transaction (pursuant to the forward purchase agreements or other forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of our initial public offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the partnering candidate, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the partnering candidate, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our partnering transaction with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 
11 

  If our partnering transaction is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our partnering transaction or used for redemptions of our shares of Class A Common Stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our partnering transaction, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our partnering transaction, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the partnering transaction, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such partnering transaction. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our partnering transaction. Other than the forward purchase agreements, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise. 
 Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular partnering candidate with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a partnering candidate may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a partnering candidate. 
 Sources of Partnering Candidates 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing a partnering transaction with a partnering candidate that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or from completing the partnering transaction through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our partnering transaction with a partnering candidate that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm, that such a partnering transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
Evaluation of a Partnering Candidate and Structuring of Our Partnering Transaction 
 In evaluating a prospective partnering candidate, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular partnering candidate, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the partnering transaction. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a partnering candidate and to structure and complete our partnering transaction, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective partnering candidate with which our partnering transaction is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another partnering transaction. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our partnering transaction. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our partnering transaction, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete a partnering transaction with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our partnering transaction with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our partnering transaction, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Partnering Candidate’s Management Team 
 Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective partnering candidate when evaluating the desirability of effecting our partnering transaction with that business, our assessment of the partnering candidate’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the partnering candidate cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our partnering transaction. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our partnering transaction, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our partnering transaction. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular partnering candidate. 
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our partnering transaction. 
 Following a partnering transaction, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the partnering candidate. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Partnering Transaction 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. 
 Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of partnering transactions we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 
 

Type of Transaction | Whether Stockholder Approval is Required
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of partnering candidate not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of partnering candidate into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a partnering candidate | Yes 


Under the NYSE’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our partnering transaction if, for example: 
 

• | we issue shares of Common Stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our shares of Common Stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



13 

   
• | any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the partnering candidate or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of Common Stock could result in an increase in outstanding Common Stock or voting power of 5% or more;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | or the issuance or potential issuance of Common Stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities 
 If we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our partnering transaction. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event that our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors, operating partners or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
 The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the partnering transaction and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the partnering transaction or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a partnering candidate that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our partnering transaction, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our partnering transaction. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our partnering transaction that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Class A Common Stock or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 Our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers, directors, operating partners and/or their affiliates may identify the stockholders with whom our initial stockholders, officers, directors, operating partners or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders (in the case of shares of Class A Common Stock) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our partnering transaction. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, operating partners and advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our partnering transaction, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our partnering transaction but only if such shares have not already been voted at the stockholder meeting related to our partnering transaction. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors, operating partners or any of their affiliates will select which stockholders to purchase shares from based on a negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. Our sponsor, officers, directors, operating partners and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements.

  Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of Our Partnering Transaction 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A Common Stock upon the completion of our partnering transaction at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the partnering transaction, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $25.00 per public share. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our partnering transaction. 
Limitations on Redemptions 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed partnering transaction may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the partnering candidate or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A Common Stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed partnering transaction exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the partnering transaction or redeem any shares in connection with such partnering transaction, and all shares of Class A Common Stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our partnering transaction either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the partnering transaction or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed partnering transaction or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding Common Stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with the NYSE’s stockholder approval rules. 
 The requirement that we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares by one of the two methods listed above will be contained in provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will apply whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on the NYSE. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 60% of the voting power of our Common Stock. 
 If we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with a stockholder meeting, we will: 
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------


If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our partnering transaction only if a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock voted are voted in favor of the partnering transaction. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our 
 
15 

  sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote any founder shares they hold and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our partnering transaction. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of Common Stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our partnering transaction once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to the founder shares, private placement shares and the performance shares, we would need 6,087,201, or approximately 36.8%, of the 16,560,000 outstanding as of December 31, 2021, to be voted in favor of a partnering transaction (assuming all outstanding shares are voted). These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our partnering transaction. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction. 
 If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will: 
 

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our partnering transaction, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the partnering transaction and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our partnering transaction until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the partnering transaction. 
 Upon the public announcement of our partnering transaction, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 We intend to require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the date on which the vote on the proposal to approve the partnering transaction is to be held. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our partnering transaction will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. We believe that this will allow our transfer agent to efficiently process any redemptions without the need for further communication or action from the redeeming public stockholders, which could delay redemptions and result in additional administrative cost. If the proposed partnering transaction is not approved and we continue to search for a partnering candidate, we will promptly return any certificates or shares delivered by public stockholders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed partnering transaction may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the partnering candidate or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash 
 
16 

  to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A Common Stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed partnering transaction exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the partnering transaction or redeem any shares in connection with such partnering transaction, and all shares of Class A Common Stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
 Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Partnering Transaction 
 If we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed partnering transaction as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our partnering transaction, particularly in connection with a partnering transaction with a partnering candidate that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. 
 However, we will not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our partnering transaction. 
 Delivering Stock Certificates in Connection with the Exercise of Redemption Rights 
 As described above, we intend to require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the date on which the scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the partnering transaction is to be held. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our partnering transaction will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder will have up to two business days prior to the vote on the partnering transaction if we distribute proxy materials, or from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, as applicable, to submit or tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures disclosed in the proxy or tender offer materials, as applicable, its shares may not be redeemed. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the broker submitting or tendering shares a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee will be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to submit or tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 
17 

  Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our partnering transaction. 
 If our partnering transaction is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 If our initial proposed partnering transaction is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a partnering transaction with a different partnering candidate until 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the closing of our initial public offering. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Partnering Transaction 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the closing of our initial public offering to complete our partnering transaction. If we do not complete our partnering transaction within such 24-month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within the 24-month time period. 
 Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the closing of our initial public offering. However, if our sponsor or management team acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within the allotted 24-month time period. 
 Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the closing of our initial public offering or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. 
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $0.5 million of proceeds held outside the trust account (as of December 31, 2021), although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 
 
18 

   If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement CAPSTM, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account and any tax payments or expenses for the dissolution of the trust, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $25.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $25.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims. 
 Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective partnering candidates and other entities with which we do business (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. 
 Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The underwriter of our initial public offering will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective partnering candidate with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or partnering transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $25.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $25.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective partnering candidate who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our partnering transaction and redemptions could be reduced to less than $25.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our partnering transaction, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective partnering candidates. 
 
19 

  In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $25.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $25.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $25.00 per share. 
 We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective partnering candidates or other entities with which we do business (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately $0.5 million of the proceeds held outside the trust account (as of December 31, 2021) with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 
 Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of the funds in our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the closing of our initial public offering may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of the funds in our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the closing of our initial public offering, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the closing of our initial public offering, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 
 Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.

  Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a newly organized company established for the purpose of identifying a company to partner with in order to effectuate a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar partnering transaction, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective partnering candidates to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective partnering candidates. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective partnering candidates or other entities with which we do business (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $25.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 
 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $25.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. 
 Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 
 Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the closing of our initial public offering, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the closing of our initial public offering or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of our partnering transaction. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our partnering transaction, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the partnering transaction alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a partnering candidate for our partnering transaction, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting partnering transactions directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger partnering candidates will 
 
21 

  be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a partnering candidate. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our partnering transaction and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain partnering candidates. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a partnering transaction. 
 Facilities 
 We currently sub-lease our executive offices at 667 Madison Avenue, 15th Floor, New York, NY 10065 from our sponsor. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 
 Employees 
 We currently have four executive officers, Sanjeev Mehra, Jeff Dodge, Todd Nice and Anish Pathipati. Neither Sanjeev Mehra, Jeff Dodge, Todd Nice nor Anish Pathipati is obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our partnering transaction. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a partnering candidate has been selected for our partnering transaction and the stage of the partnering transaction process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our partnering transaction. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 We registered our CAPSTM, shares of Class A Common Stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective partnering candidate as part of the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the partnering candidate. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential partnering candidates we may conduct a partnering transaction with because some partnering candidates may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our partnering transaction within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular partnering candidate identified by us as a potential partnering transaction candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential partnering candidate will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed partnering candidate. While this may limit the pool of potential partnering transaction candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A partnering candidate may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such partnering transaction.

  On December 9, 2020, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our partnering transaction. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A Common Stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
