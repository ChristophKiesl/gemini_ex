BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
Genie Energy Ltd. is comprised of the following two businesses:
 
Genie Retail Energy (GRE) owns retail energy providers (REPs), including IDT Energy, Inc. (IDT Energy), Residents Energy, Inc. (Residents Energy) and Retail Energy Holdings, LLC, and energy brokerage and marketing services. Its REP businesses resell electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers primarily in the Eastern United States.
 
Genie Oil and Gas, Inc., (GOGAS), is an oil and gas exploration company. GOGAS projects include an oil and gas exploration project in Israel operated by its subsidiary, Afek Oil and Gas, Ltd., or Afek, where the company is in the process of operating on a petroleum exploration license covering 396.5 square kilometers in the southern portion of the Golan Heights.
 
CORPORATE STRUCTURE
 
Genie Energy Ltd., a Delaware corporation, owns 99.3% of its subsidiary, Genie Energy International Corporation, or GEIC, which owns 100% of GRE, and 92% of GOGAS. GOGAS holds an 85.1% interest in Afek. GOGAS also holds interests in three inactive oil and gas projects: an 86.1% interest in Israel Energy Initiatives, Ltd., or IEI, an oil shale development project in Israel, an 88.2% interest in Genie Mongolia, Inc., an oil shale exploration project in Central Mongolia, and a 98.3% interest in American Shale Oil Corporation, or AMSO, which operated an oil shale development project in Colorado that was decommissioned.
 
GRE has outstanding deferred stock units granted to officers and employees that represent an interest of 2.5 % of the equity of GRE.

KEY EVENTS IN OUR HISTORY
 
Genie was incorporated in January 2011. References to us in the following discussion are made on a consolidated basis as if we existed and owned Genie Retail Energy and Genie Oil and Gas in all periods discussed.
 
In November 2004, IDT Corporation, or IDT, our former corporate parent, launched a retail energy provider business in New York State under the brand name IDT Energy.
 
In April 2013, the Government of Israel finalized the award to our subsidiary, Afek, of an exclusive three-year petroleum exploration license covering 396.5 square kilometers in the southern portion of the Golan Heights in Northern Israel. The license has been extended to April 2018. Israel’s Northern District Planning and Building Committee granted Afek a one-year permit that commenced in February 2015, which has been subsequently extended to April 18, 2018, to conduct an up to ten-well oil and gas exploration program. This permit as extended is expected to cover the remainder of Afek’s ongoing exploration program in the area covered by its exploration license.

In December 2013, GRE acquired Dallas-based Diversegy, LLC, a retail energy advisory and brokerage company that serves commercial and industrial customers throughout the United States.
 
In April 2014, Israel’s Northern District Planning and Building Committee issued a one-year exploratory drilling permit to Afek. The permit, subsequently extended, authorizes the company to drill up to ten exploratory wells within its exploratory license area.
 
In February 2015, Afek began drilling its first exploratory well in Northern Israel’s Golan Heights pursuant to its petroleum exploration license.
 
In October 2015, Afek confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons in its license area based on the data gathered from its exploratory drilling program.
 
In November 2016, Genie Retail Energy purchased Retail Energy Holdings, LLC, which operates REPs under the name Town Square Energy. The acquisition added 48,000 residential customer equivalents, or RCEs, and expanded GRE’s serviceable markets into Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and new territories in Ohio.
 
Spin-Off from IDT Corporation
 
We were formerly a subsidiary of IDT. On October 28, 2011, we were spun-off by IDT and became an independent public company through a pro rata distribution of our common stock to IDT’s stockholders, which we refer to as the Spin-Off. As a result of the Spin-Off, each of IDT’s stockholders received: (i) one share of our Class A common stock for every share of IDT’s Class A common stock held of record on October 21, 2011, or the Record Date, and (ii) one share of our Class B common stock for every share of IDT’s Class B common stock held of record on the Record Date.
 
Exchange Offer and Issuance of Preferred Stock
 
On August 2, 2012, we initiated an offer to exchange up to 8.75 million outstanding shares of our Class B common stock for the same number of shares of a new series of preferred stock. On October 17, 2012, we issued 1,604,591 shares of our newly designated Series 2012-A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, in exchange for an equal number of shares of Class B common stock tendered in the exchange offer.
 
In subsequent exchange offers concluded in March 2013 and June 2014, we issued an aggregate of 718,108 shares of Series 2012-A Preferred Stock in exchange for an equal number of shares of Class B common stock tendered in the exchange offer.
 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
Afek
 
In February 2017, Afek began preparing the location for its sixth exploratory well in the Northern portion of its license area; the drilling is expected to begin in mid-March and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017. Analysis of the results from previous wells, well flow tests and other tests is ongoing.

Genie Retail Energy
 
Genie Retail Energy is comprised of REPs and related businesses. GRE’s REP businesses purchase electricity and natural gas on the wholesale markets and resells these commodities to its residential and small business customers. The positive difference between the net sales price of electricity and natural gas sold to its customers and the cost of its electricity and natural gas supplies and related costs is the REP businesses’ gross profit.
 
GRE’s REP businesses operate in certain utility territories within the retail energy markets of ten states in the Eastern and Midwestern US: Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, as well as in Washington, D.C.
 
GRE’s REP businesses operate under several brand names including IDT Energy, Residents Energy, and Town Square Energy. Their diverse offerings include, in electricity markets, variable rate offerings, fixed rate offerings, and green renewable electricity offerings. Natural gas offerings include both variable and fixed rate offerings.
 
Historically, GRE’s REP businesses have expanded organically – adding new customers through customer acquisition programs at a rate faster than customers lost through attrition or churn. New customers are generally acquired through a combination of marketing and sales channels including door-to-door solicitation, telemarketing, online and digital marketing, and direct mail, and by competitive bidding for exclusive contracts awarded by certain municipalities that, when authorized by state laws, award participating residents’ electricity supply to a single supplier.
 
In November 2016, GRE closed on the acquisition of Retail Energy Holdings, LLC (REH), a privately held retail electricity provider operating under the Town Square Energy brand. The acquisition added approximately 48,000 RCEs to GRE’s customer base. Town Square Energy, operates in eight Eastern states and its licenses and customer base expands GRE’s geographic footprint to four new states – New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut – and provides additional electricity customers in New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
 
Customer churn is a significant factor in the REP business, with monthly churn rates for GRE’s REPs averaging between four and eight percent per month. Customer churn tends to decrease when commodity prices fall, when weather-driven consumption decreases, when the price to REP customers decreases relative to competitors including the incumbent utility provider, or when the REPs incentivize customer tenure. Customer churn tends to increase when commodity prices rise, when weather driven consumption increases or spikes, or when the price to REP customers increases relative to the prices charged by competitors including incumbent utility providers.
 
GRE also operates several smaller non-REP businesses including Diversegy. Diversegy, which GRE acquired in December 2013, operates as an energy broker and advisor to industrial, commercial and municipal customers across deregulated energy markets in the United States. Diversegy’s customers are not served only by GRE REPs.
 
In 2016, GRE launched Genie Solar Energy, a provider of end-to-end solar solutions primarily for commercial customers. Genie Solar currently operates in five states – Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania,
 
GRE’s revenue represents 100% of our total consolidated revenue since our inception. In 2016, GRE generated revenue of $212 million comprised of $179 million from sales of electricity, $31 million from sales of natural gas, and other revenue of $2 million, as compared with revenue of $213 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 comprised of $170 million from the sales of electricity, $41 million from the sales of natural gas and other revenue of $2 million. Electricity sales have become a more significant portion of GRE’s business in recent years.

GRE’s REP businesses are seasonal businesses, particularly sales of natural gas. Approximately 43% and 64% of our natural gas revenues in 2016 and 2015, respectively, were generated during the first quarter, when the demand for heating was highest. Although the demand for electricity is not as seasonal as natural gas, approximately 31% and 29% of total revenues from electricity sales were generated in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
The weather has a significant impact on GRE’s operations. For example, unusually sustained cold weather in the first quarter of 2014 drove increased demand. Coupled with short reserves of natural gas in the wholesale markets and delivery constrictions beyond our control, this caused a significant increase in revenues and cost of revenues in the first quarter of 2014. In addition, many electricity generation plants are natural gas fired. That winter’s “polar vortex” resulted in extraordinarily large spikes in the prices of wholesale electricity and natural gas in markets where GRE’s REPs and other retail providers purchase their supply.
 
Abrupt increases in supply commodity prices when coupled with higher than anticipated demand because of extreme weather, such as during the ‘polar vortex’, can significantly reduce or eliminate GRE’s gross profit margins as we seek to cushion the impact of the price spikes on our customers. They also can trigger enhanced regulatory scrutiny of REPs, restrictive regulation and litigation.
 
Industry Overview
 
GRE operates retail energy providers that operate in states with deregulated retail energy markets. Like other REPs, GRE’s REPs purchase electricity and natural gas on the wholesale markets and resell the commodities to its customers, primarily homeowners, renters and small businesses. The incumbent local utilities continue to handle electricity and natural gas distribution, billing, and collections. A portion of the proceeds billed to GRE’s REPs customers for the commodity supply is remitted to the REPs.
 
GRE has no significant fixed assets and low levels of capital expenditure. Its cost of revenues is incurred to purchase electricity and natural gas in their respective wholesale markets. Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily related to customer acquisition, customer retention, billing and purchase of receivables, or POR, fees paid to the utilities, and program management.
 
Customers; Marketing
 
The services of GRE’s REPs IDT Energy, Residents Energy and Town Square Energy are made available to customers under several categories of terms and conditions. The majority of our current customer base is enrolled in variable rate programs, the only programs GRE’s REPs offered until 2014, via automatically renewing or month-to-month agreements, which enable us to recover our wholesale costs for electricity and natural gas through adjustments to the rates charged to our customers. The frequency and degree of these rate adjustments is determined by GRE, and is not restricted by regulation.
 
Variable rate energy supply programs are available to all customers in all states served by GRE’s REPs. Likewise, Renewable (Green) energy supply options exist in all markets served by GRE’s REPs. Renewable (Green) Electricity supply is 100% matched with renewable energy certificates that reflect the generation of electricity from sources like hydro-electric wind, solar and biomass.
 
For our variable rate product, the amount we charge to our customers reflects the underlying commodity cost plus a markup. During times of rising costs, we typically experience higher rates of churn than when costs are declining or stable.
 
The electricity and natural gas we sell are metered and delivered to customers by the local utilities. Consequently, we do not have a maintenance or service staff for customer locations. The utilities also provide billing and collection services for the majority of our customers. For a small number of direct bill customers, we perform our own billing and collection. Additionally, GRE’s REPs’ receivables are, in many states, purchased by the utilities in whose areas we operate for a percentage of their face value (over the course of 2016, the associated cost was approximately 1.6% of revenue) in exchange for the utility receiving a first priority lien in the customer receivable without recourse against the REP.
 
GRE’s REP businesses market their energy services primarily through direct marketing methods, including door-to-door sales, outbound telemarketing direct mail and internet signup. As of December 31, 2016, GRE serviced 412,000 meters (296,000 electric and 116,000 natural gas), as compared to 392,000 meters (264,000 electric and 128,000 natural gas) as of December 31, 2015.
 
GRE’s strategy is to acquire profitable customers in low-risk markets, specifically where the utilities have adopted a portfolio of REP-friendly, regulatory-driven programs. Among these programs is purchase of receivables programs, where utilities are contractually obligated to purchase customer receivables at a pre-determined fixed discount. Under POR programs, utilities offer consolidated billing, where the utilities have the responsibility for billing the individual customer and the subsequent collection of the remittances. There are markets in which we operate that the utilities engage in consolidated billing on behalf of REP’s but are not obligated to guarantee the receivables. Additionally, we target markets in which we can procure energy in an efficient and transparent manner. We seek to purchase wholesale energy where there is a real time market that reflects a fair price for the commodity for all participants. This allows GRE to reflect a true market cost base and adjust its rates to its variable rate customers taking into account its competitors who change their commodity prices at longer intervals.

Utilities in Connecticut, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Washington, D.C., Massachusetts and Maryland offer POR programs, without recourse, that permit customers with past-due balances to remain in the POR and consolidated bill programs. However, utilities in New Jersey generally do not permit customers with past-due balances beyond 120 days to enroll or remain in their POR programs, which means that after a certain amount of time (determined based on the specific commodity), the REP becomes responsible for the billing and collection of the commodity portion of the future invoices for its delinquent customers. Utilities in New Hampshire and Rhode Island do not offer POR but they do offer consolidated billing.
 
We also regularly monitor other deregulated or deregulating markets to determine if they are appropriate for entry, and may initiate the licensing process in a selected region to facilitate entry into the region contingent upon favorable deregulatory developments.
 
Acquisition and Management of Gas and Electric Supply
 
Since 2009, IDT Energy and Residents Energy have been party to a Preferred Supplier Agreement with BP Energy Company, or BP. The agreement allows for purchases of electricity and natural gas for customers focused in areas where the utilities have POR programs. Under the arrangement, IDT Energy and Residents Energy purchase electricity and natural gas at market rate plus a fee. IDT Energy’s obligations to BP are secured by a first security interest in deposits or receivables from utilities in connection with their purchase of IDT Energy’s customer’s receivables under the applicable POR program, and in any cash deposits or letters of credit posted in connection with any collateral accounts with BP. The agreement with BP has been amended to cover the territories in which we operate. The agreement was modified and extended on November 19, 2015, and is scheduled to terminate on November 30, 2019. IDT Energy and Residents Energy’s ability to purchase electricity and natural gas under this agreement is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including the maintenance of certain covenants.
 
GRE is required to meet certain minimum green energy supply criteria in some of the markets in which it operates. We meet those thresholds by acquiring renewable energy certificates, or REC’s. In addition, GRE offers green or other renewable energy products to its customers in several territories. GRE acquires green renewable energy conversion rights or attributes and REC’s to satisfy the load requirements for these customers.
 
As an owner of REPs, GRE does not own electrical power generation, transmission, or distribution facilities, or natural gas production, pipeline or distribution facilities. GRE’s REPs currently contract with Dominion Transmission, Inc., National Fuel Supply, Williams Gas Pipeline and Texas Eastern Transmission and others for natural gas pipeline, storage and transportation services, and utilizes the New York Independent System Operator, Inc., or NYISO, and PJM Interconnection, LLC, or PJM, for electric transmission and distribution. NYISO operates the high-voltage electric transmission network in New York State, and administers and monitors New York’s wholesale electricity markets. PJM is a regional transmission organization that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of thirteen states (including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Illinois) and the District of Columbia.
 
For risk management purposes, GRE REPs utilize forward physical delivery contracts for a portion of their purchases of electricity and natural gas, which are defined as commodity derivative contracts. In addition, GRE’s REPs enter into put and call options as hedges against unfavorable fluctuations in market prices of electricity and natural gas.
 
The NYISO and PJM perform real-time load balancing for each of the electrical power grids in which GRE REPs operate. Similarly, load balancing is performed by the utilities or local distribution company, or LDC, for each of the natural gas markets in which GRE operates. Load balancing ensures that the amount of electricity and natural gas that GRE purchases is equal to the amount necessary to service its customers’ demands at any specific point in time. GRE is charged or credited for balancing the electricity and natural gas purchased and sold for its account by its suppliers and the LDCs. GRE manages the differences between the actual electricity and natural gas demands of its customers and its bulk or block purchases by buying and selling in the spot market, and through monthly cash settlements and/or adjustments to future deliveries in accordance with the load balancing performed by utilities, LDCs, NYISO and PJM.
 
Diversegy
 
Diversegy, which we acquired in December 2013, operates as an energy broker and advisor to industrial, commercial and municipal customers across deregulated energy markets in the United States. Customers of all types and size have the ability to leverage Diversegy’s expertise and purchasing power as they evaluate their electricity and natural gas procurement plans. Diversegy allows us to enter more markets around the country as we are not limited to only the markets we operate as a REP, and we are not responsible for assuming the risk associated with procuring and managing the commodity.

Competition
 
As an operator of REPs, GRE competes with the local utility companies in each of the markets where it provides services and with many other licensed REPs. In some markets, competitor REPs are affiliated with local utilities. GRE also competes with several large vertically integrated energy companies. Some of these competitors are larger and better capitalized than GRE. Competition with the utilities and REPs exposes GRE to customer churn, especially since GRE’s residential customers generally do not sign long-term contracts.
 
REPs and utilities offering fixed rate products or guaranteed pricing often are unable to change their sell rates offered to customers in response to volatility in the prices of the underlying commodities. In a rising commodity cost environment, REPs like ours that offer variable rate products, and reflect real-time commodity costs, will typically become less competitive with fixed rate providers. Conversely, in a downward moving commodity cost environment, variable rate REPs typically become more competitive as they benefit from the lag that utilities experience in reducing their sell rate to reflect the lower commodity costs.
 
Increasing our market share depends in part on our ability to persuade more customers to switch from other providers to GRE than those that churn from us to other providers. Moreover, local utilities and some REPs may have certain advantages such as name recognition, financial strength and long-standing relationships with customers. Persuading potential customers to switch to GRE requires significant marketing and sales operations.
 
Regulation
 
While GRE’s REPs variable rates are not regulated, they, like all GRE’s REP programs, are governed by their terms and conditions, which are accepted by all customers. GRE’s REPS are required to comply with various reporting requirements in order to maintain eligibility to operate as a REP. Certain jurisdictions require GRE’s REPs to publish its customer offers with the applicable regulatory commission, or in the public domain, generally a website established for such purpose.
 
Because of the resulting dramatic increases in wholesale electricity costs during the winter’s “polar vortex” in 2014, the retail electricity prices that GRE’s REPs and many other variable rate electricity suppliers charged to their customers also increased sharply. These retail electricity price increases resulted in large numbers of complaints, regulatory actions, and calls for legislation, regulation and litigation. GRE’s subsidiary, IDT Energy, also paid approximately $5 million in rebates to affected customers in the year ended December 31, 2014. These events adversely affected GRE’s REPs customer churn, gross margins and results of operations.
 
As discussed more fully below in Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” in this Annual Report, IDT Energy reached a settlement with the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office and the Acting Consumer Advocate terminating litigation with no admission of liability or finding of wrongdoing by IDT Energy.
 
As discussed more fully below, on February 23, 2016, the New York Public Service Commission, or PSC, issued an order that sought to impose significant new restrictions on REPs operating in New York, including GRE. On December 2, 2016, the PSC noticed an evidentiary hearing scheduled to take place in 2017 to assess the retail energy market in New York. That process is underway and is expected to last several months. We are evaluating the potential impact of any new order from the PSC that would follow from the evidentiary process, while preparing to operate in compliance with any new requirements that may be imposed. Depending on the final language of any new order, as well as our ability to modify our relationships with our New York customers, an order could have a substantial impact upon the operations of GRE-owned REPs in New York. As of December 31, 2016, New York represented 44% of GRE’s total meters served and 33% of the total RCEs of GRE’s customer base.
 
REPs such as ours must be licensed in each state and utility service territory in which they operate. Each is subject to the rules and regulations governing the operations of REPs in each jurisdiction.
 
As of December 31, 2016, GRE’s REPs operate in eight utility territories in New York, six utility territories in New Jersey, nine utility territories in Pennsylvania, four utility territories in Maryland, six utility territories in Ohio, five utility territories in Massachusetts, two utility territories in New Hampshire, two in Connecticut, one in Rhode Island, one in Washington, D.C. and two in Illinois. The State of New York, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the State of New Jersey, the State of Maryland, the State of Illinois, the District of Columbia, the State of Ohio, the State of New Hampshire, the State of Rhode Island, the State of Connecticut, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the federal government, and related public service/utility commissions, among others, establish the rules and regulations for our REP operations.
 
Like all operators of REPs, GRE is affected by the actions of governmental agencies, mostly on the state level, by the respective state Public Service/Utility Commissions, and other organizations (such as NYISO and PJM) and indirectly by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Regulations applicable to electricity and natural gas have undergone substantial change over the past several years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. We may be subject to new laws, orders or regulations or the revision or interpretation of existing laws, orders or regulations.

Employees
 
As of March 1, 2017, GRE employed 180 full time employees, 72 of whom are located in the Jamestown, New York office, of which approximately 85% are affiliated with our customer care center, 57 of whom are located in our New Jersey office, 13 of whom are located in our Arizona office and 38 of whom are located in the Florida and New York offices performing customer acquisition and support.
Genie Oil and Gas, Inc.
 
Genie Oil and Gas (GOGAS) is an oil and gas exploration company. GOGAS currently holds an 85.1% interest in Afek, our only active oil and gas exploration project, which operates in the southern portion of the Golan Heights in Northern Israel. In addition, GOGAS holds an interest in three inactive or disbanded projects including an 88.2% interest in Genie Mongolia, Inc., an oil shale exploration project in Central Mongolia, a 98.3% interest in AMSO, which operated American Shale Oil, LLC, or AMSO, LLC, an oil shale development project in Colorado that was substantially decommissioned, and an 86.1% interest in IEI, an oil shale development project in Israel’s Shfela Basin.
Afek Oil and Gas Ltd.
 
In April 2013, the Government of Israel finalized the award to Afek of an exclusive three-year petroleum exploration license covering 396.5 square kilometers in the southern portion of the Golan Heights. The license has been extended to April 2018. Israel’s Northern District Planning and Building Committee granted Afek a one-year permit that commenced in February 2015, which has been subsequently extended to April 18, 2018, to conduct an up to ten-well oil and gas exploration program. This permit as extended is expected to cover the remainder of Afek’s ongoing exploration program in the area covered by its exploration license. Afek retained oil and gas exploration professionals and contracted with internationally recognized vendors to provide the services required for its exploration program. In 2013, Afek completed preliminary geophysical work including electromagnetic surveys and the reprocessing of the 2D seismic data to characterize the subsurface prior to drilling exploration wells. Afek subsequently conducted initial analysis of the acquired data internally and with outside experts.
 
In early 2014, Afek submitted a permit application to the Northern District Planning and Building Committee to conduct an exploration drilling program to further characterize the resource in its license area. In July of 2014, the Northern District Planning and Building Committee voted to approve an up to ten-well exploratory drilling program, and subsequently issued the requisite permits.
 
In October, 2014, the High Court of Justice in Israel issued an interim order to halt Afek’s drilling program until it could rule on a petition filed by the Israel Union for Environmental Defense and some local residents challenging the issuance of the drilling permit. In December 2014, the Court ruled against the petitioners, and lifted its interim order.
 
In February 2015, Afek began drilling its first exploratory well in Northern Israel’s Golan Heights. To date, Afek has completed drilling five wells. In addition, Afek has undertaken well flow tests in multiple target zones within two of the completed wells. The results of the exploration program to date confirmed the presence of significant hydrocarbons in the basin, but initial indications are that it is not commercially viable given current and forecasted market conditions and other constraints, and that the greatest potential for commercial development lies in an area further north within the license area than any of the five completed exploratory wells drilled to date.
 
Upon completion of drilling its fifth well, Afek turned its operational focus to the Northern region of its license area. Afek views the Northern and Southern regions separately when evaluating its unproved properties. The regions are demarcated as such due to the presence of the Sheik Ali Fault, which divides the Northwestern portion of Afek’s license from the rest of its acreage. The data analyzed to date, including reprocessed existing seismic data, suggests that the source rock identified in the Southern block may extend northward at depths potentially sufficient to have induced a greater level of maturation of the resource. To validate this hypothesis, in February 2017, Afek began preparing the location for its sixth exploratory well in the Northern portion of its license area. Afek expects to spud this new well, Ness 10, during mid-March 2017 and complete the well during the second quarter of 2017. The volume of the resources and to what extent they may be extractable cannot yet be determined. The resources do not constitute proved, probable or possible reserves.
 
Afek incurred exploration expenses of $6.1 million, $6.6 million and $7.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

In January 2017, we established Atid Drilling Ltd., (Atid), an on-shore drilling services venture based in Israel. Atid will serve as the primary drilling contractor for Afek and opportunistically pursue drilling opportunities for clients in a variety of fields including oil and gas exploration, water resource development and mineral exploration. Atid has executed a binding MOU to purchase a drilling rig and associated drilling equipment.  The rig has successfully drilled five exploratory oil and gas wells in the Golan Heights over the past two years and recently completed a well in northern Israel.
 
Genie Mongolia
 
In April 2013, Genie Mongolia and the Petroleum Authority of Mongolia entered into an exclusive oil shale development agreement to explore and evaluate the commercial potential of oil shale resources in a 34,470 square kilometer area in Central Mongolia. Genie Mongolia maintains the rights to the acreage it has acquired, however, it has suspended its operations in Mongolia.
 
Genie Mongolia incurred research and development expenses of $0.1 million, $1.7 million and $2.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
AMSO, LLC
 
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, effective January 1, 2007, issued to EGL Resources a lease for research, development and demonstration, or RD&D Lease, in western Colorado, which it assigned to its affiliate, E.G.L. Oil Shale, L.L.C. (or EGL). In April 2008, EGL was acquired by AMSO and IDT (and subsequently renamed AMSO, LLC) in exchange for cash of $5.5 million, certain commitments for future funding of AMSO, LLC’s operations and a 1% override on AMSO, LLC’s future revenue. In March 2009, a subsidiary of TOTAL S.A., or Total, the world’s fifth largest integrated oil and gas company, acquired a 50% interest in AMSO, LLC in exchange for cash paid to us of $3.2 million and Total’s commitment to fund the majority of AMSO, LLC’s research, development and demonstration expenditures as well as certain other funding commitments. On February 23, 2016, Total notified AMSO of its decision not to continue to fund AMSO, LLC. On March 23, 2016, Total gave AMSO its notice of withdrawal from AMSO, LLC. The withdrawal was effective on April 30, 2016. The project was substantially decommissioned by December 2016.
 
AMSO, LLC incurred $3.1 million, $4.8 million and $7.8 million for research and development in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
Israel Energy Initiatives, Ltd.
 
IEI had an exclusive Shale Oil Exploration and Production License awarded in July 2008 by the Government of Israel. The license covered approximately 238 square kilometers in the south of the Shfela region in central Israel. In June 2013, IEI submitted its application for the construction and operation of its oil shale pilot test facility to the Jerusalem District Building and Planning Committee. IEI was asked to provide supplements to the environmental impact assessment and a revised application was submitted in November, 2013. In September 2014, the Jerusalem District Building and Planning Committee voted against issuing the pilot plant building and construction permits. Operations at IEI are currently suspended.
 
IEI incurred nil, $0.2 million and $2.6 million for research and development in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
Competition
 
If Afek is successful in developing and producing commercial quantities of oil and gas in an environmentally acceptable manner and receives all the necessary regulatory approvals, then, in the commercial production phases of operations, it will likely face competition from conventional and unconventional oil producers, other fossil fuels and other alternative energy providers in marketing and selling refined products and natural gas. Many of the potential competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources to be able to withstand the volatility of the oil and gas market (including as to price, availability, refining capacity and other factors).
Regulation
 
Afek holds an exclusive exploration license in Northern Israel’s Golan Heights, granted by Israel’s National Infrastructure, Energy and Water Ministry. Although the original license term expired in April 2016, the license has been extended to April 2018. On February 1, 2016, Israel’s Northern District Planning and Building Committee approved a two-year permit extension for Afek to continue to conduct its up to ten-well oil and gas exploration program. The original permit was for a one-year period, which commenced in February 2015. On March 2, 2017, Afek received an additional extension until April 18, 2018. This extension is expected to cover the remainder of Afek’s ongoing exploratory program in the area covered by its exploratory license. Contingent upon the results of its exploration program, Afek may seek to declare a commercial discovery and apply for a commercial production lease pursuant to Israeli law. The international community considers the Golan Heights an internationally disputed territory, and therefore political risk may affect our ability to execute our plan of operations. This may influence local decision makers, as well as service providers necessary to our operations.
