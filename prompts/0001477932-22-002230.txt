Item 1. Description of Business
Introduction

Merion, Inc. is a provider of health and nutritional supplements and personal care products. Currently, we are mainly selling our products over the internet directly to end-user customers through our website, at www.merionus.com, and to wholesale distributors through phone and electronic communication. Our major customers of our nutritional and beauty products are located in the Asian market, predominantly in the People’s Republic of China. Our major customers of our Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) and packaging products are located in the United States (“U.S.”).
Company History

Merion, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was formed on February 4, 2011. Its predecessor, E-World USA Holding, Inc., was a California company incorporated in 2007 (“E-World CA”). In April 2011, E-World CA entered into a merger agreement with its wholly-owned subsidiary with the same name, E-World USA Holding, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“E-World NV”), that was the survivor of the merger and became the Company. Under the Merger Agreement, the Company issued 90,000,000 shares of its common stock on a one-for-one basis for each share of E-World CA’s common stock issued and outstanding at the date of the merger. In addition, the Company issued its Type A Warrants and Type B Warrants in exchange for comparable warrants issued and outstanding of E-World CA at the date of the merger. On June 27, 2017, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State for the State of Nevada to change its name effective immediately, from E-World NV, to Merion, Inc. 
Products

Since June 2014, we have been selling our products primarily over the internet directly to end-user customers and by phone/email orders directly to our wholesale distributors. Certain miscellaneous sales are made directly to customers who call the Company directly for products. We are now focusing on selling health and nutritional supplements and personal care products directly on the internet through our website at www.merionus.com and provide OEM and packaging products through third party manufacturing. As of the date of filing of this report, we market eight individual nutritional supplement products. We did not develop any new products in 2021. We are no longer selling similar products of third parties on our website.

In January 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with SUSS Technology Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the “Seller”), pursuant to which the Seller agreed to sell to the Company substantially all of the assets associated with the Seller’s manufacture of dietary supplements (the “Nevada Factory”) for an aggregate purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) of $1,000,000 and 333,334 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Purchase Shares”) valued at $320,000. The Seller was one of our major suppliers during the year ended December 31, 2017. These assets met all industry nutritional and dietary supplement manufacturing standards, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Good Manufacturing Practice compliance and Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. Upon purchasing these assets from the Seller, we started to manufacture some of the nutritional supplements that we sold until May 2021. In May 2021, we determined that it would be more beneficial to outsource to third-party manufacturers the production of our branded and OEM products rather than manufacturing through our Nevada Factory. As a result, we disposed of our factory machinery and terminated our Nevada Factory lease in May 2021. As we have significant continuing involvement in the sale of our branded and OEM products through our third-party manufacturers, this restructuring did not constitute a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, the results of operations for our Nevada Factory were not reported as discontinued operations under the guidance of FASB ASC 205.

Company Products

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 which has limited global travel, transportation, and import and export of goods, the Company has focused more on its OEM and packaging business to provide private label supplement products or customized formula supplement products to wholesale and retail customers. We manufactured these products through our Nevada Factory prior to May 2021 and subsequently we purchase the raw material for the products and outsource to third-party manufacturers and packaging companies to produce and pack these products for our customers after we closed our Nevada Factory in May 2021.

For the wholesale and retail customers who are looking for private label products, we provide our own formulas, purchase raw material and contract third party manufacturers to produce products. For the customers who have their own formulas, we purchase raw materials and outsource to the third-party manufacturers and packing companies for their products.

We continue to sell our nutritional supplement and beauty products on our website. Our nutritional supplement products are made according to a micro molecular nutrition formula. To achieve the maximum effect of products, micro molecular health foods were designed to be absorbed by cells directly with minimum chemical conversion, which we believe promotes faster absorption. We believe our company is one of only a few companies in the market which are using a micro molecular nutrition formula.

In January 2018, we introduced a beauty product, Noir Naturel, a gentle formula for grey coverage from the first application into hair care.

In September 2018, we introduced three different types of natural aphrodisiac supplements, Viwooba (1-3) for men that may support kidney health, improve immunity, enhance physical fitness, eliminate fatigue, improve sexual desire and enhance body energy, strength and sexual ability.

In March 2019, we introduced 1) Lady-S, a female dietary supplement that may assist with weight loss, 2) Gold King, a nutritional supplement that may provide antioxidant support and liver health, 3) New Power, a nutritional supplement that may support heart health, and 4) Taibao, a nutritional supplement that may enhance physical performance and energy metabolism.

In December 2019, we introduced ReMage Power, a nutritional supplement that may provide anti-aging Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ support and promote energy & cell metabolism.

The nutritional supplements’ and beauty products’ formulas do not have patent protection.

Currently, the Company does not have plans to expand its business beyond the nutritional products and beauty sector and the OEM and packaging sector.

Merion guarantees the quality of its products, and will exchange any product found to be defective. Additionally, customers can apply for a 90% refund of the original purchase price of purchased products within 60 days of purchase. When products are returned, they must be unopened and resalable. All shipping fees for product exchanges or returns must be fully paid by customers. All of the returned products must not be damaged and must be within the valid shelf-life period specified on the product label. In addition to the Company’s 60-day return policy, the Company, at its discretion, may accept a customer’s application for a buy-back of products previously sold within one year at 90% of the original product costs less commissions and shipping costs.

For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no returns of products.

Sourcing and Production

Our Products

During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we acquired our ingredients from the suppliers and contracted for production of our proprietary products from manufacturers that we believe are reliable, reputable and deliver high quality materials, products and services. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we also acquired our ingredients from suppliers for direct production in our Nevada factory until we disposed of our factory machinery and terminated our Nevada Factory lease in May 2021. In 2021, three suppliers accounted for approximately 69.2% of our total purchases: American Health Formulations Inc. (35.3%), Nutriient LLC (22.8%), and Myland Nutraceuticals Holding (HK) Ltd. (11.1%). In 2020, one supplier accounted for approximately 71.8% of our total purchases: Xi'an Yanhao Bio-tech Co., Ltd. The loss of one or more of these suppliers could have a negative impact on our sales and revenues if we cannot find a substitute quickly or upon favorable terms.

The Company does not have a written or contractual agreement with our other suppliers or manufacturers. Our product ingredient sourcing and other manufacturing requirements are conducted on a purchase-order basis. If one or more of our current suppliers stopped selling us ingredients and/or if one or more of our current manufacturers stopped manufacturing our products, we would be forced to find other suppliers and manufacturers. The time needed to find other suppliers or manufacturers could outlast the inventory on hand and result in loss of sales.

We maintain good relationships with our suppliers and do not anticipate that any of our suppliers will terminate such relationships in the near term. We also have ongoing relationships with secondary and tertiary suppliers. In the event that we become unable to source any products or ingredients from our major suppliers, we believe that we would be able to replace those products or substitute source these ingredients from our secondary and tertiary suppliers without great difficulty or significant increases to our cost of goods sold.

In January 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with SUSS Technology Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the “Seller”), pursuant to which the Seller agreed to sell to the Company substantially all of the assets associated with the Seller’s manufacture of dietary supplements (the “Nevada Factory”) for an aggregate purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) of $1,000,000 and 333,334 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Purchase Shares”) valued at $320,000. Upon purchasing these assets from the Seller, we started to manufacture some of the nutritional supplements that we sold until May 2021. In May 2021, we determined that it would be more beneficial to outsource to third-party manufacturers the production of our branded and OEM products rather than manufacturing through our Nevada Factory. As a result, we disposed of our factory machinery and terminated our Nevada Factory lease in May 2021. As we have significant continuing involvement in the sale of our branded and OEM products through our third-party manufacturers, this restructuring did not constitute a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, the results of operations for our Nevada Factory were not reported as discontinued operations under the guidance of FASB ASC 205.

For nutritional products and beauty products, we purchase our ingredients from third parties and contract with a third-party manufacturer for further processing of the raw materials into final products to be sold. Prior to January 1, 2018 and starting on June 1, 2021, we did not own a manufacturing plant for product processing and all manufacturing was conducted by third parties.  

We also maintain good relationships with our manufacturers and do not anticipate that any of our manufacturers will terminate such relationships in the near term. In the event we become unable have our products produced by our major manufacturers, we believe that we would be able to reallocate production to our other manufacturers or locate other manufacturers without great difficulty or significant increases to our cost of goods sold.

In addition, we maintain good relationships with our wholesale distributors in China and our OEM and packaging customers in the U.S. and do not anticipate that any of those parties will terminate such relationships in the near term.  In 2021, one customer accounted for approximately 86.5% of our sales: Uhealth Global Inc. In 2020, one customer accounted for approximately 56.2% of our sales: Staradiant Inc. The loss of one or more customers could result in a potential loss of sales and have a significant negative effect on our operations.

Order Backlog

As of December 31, 2021, we have approximately $0.9 million of order backlog.

Industry Analysis

The nutrition and supplement OEM and packaging business includes enterprises engaged in the production and packaging of health and nutrition supplements for third party customers. The revenue for health and nutrition supplements OEM business has experienced consistent growth over the five years between 2016 and 2021, driven by increased demand from consumers. Increasing consumer awareness of personal health and wellbeing is expected to be a key driving factor for health and nutrition supplements. The increasing number of products launched by small entrepreneur companies that do not have manufacturing capacity is also expected to drive the global health and nutrition supplements OEM market growth. Outsourcing is on the rise in the nutrition supplements industry and contract manufacturing helps supplement companies to approach the business processes in a customer-centric way, which helps lower costs, improve business efficiency and raise profits.

The nutrition industry includes many small and medium sized companies that manufacture and distribute products generally intended to enhance the body’s performance and wellness. The three major product categories within the nutrition industry are:


· | Nutritional Supplements – products such as vitamins, minerals, nutritional supplements, herbs and botanicals and compounds derived from these substances.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Natural and Organic Foods – products such as cereals, milk, non-diary beverages and frozen entrees. 
· | Functional Foods – products with added ingredients or fortification specifically for health or performance purposes. 


The nutritional supplement market is characterized by:


· | Large selections of essentially similar products that are difficult to differentiate. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Retail consumers’ emphasis on value pricing. 
· | Constantly changing formulations based on evolving scientific research. 
· | Low entry barriers resulting from low brand loyalty, rapid change, widely available manufacturing, low regulatory requirements and ready access to large distribution channels, such as the Internet and retail stores selling nutritional supplements and other direct marketing companies.
· | A lack of uniform standards regarding product ingredient sources, potency, purity, absorption rate and form. 

Competition

The market for nutritional products is large and intensely competitive. The Company competes directly with companies that manufacture and market nutritional products. The Company competes with other companies in the nutritional products industry by emphasizing the uniqueness, value and premium quality of the Company's products and convenience of the Company's Internet sales system. Many of the Company's competitors have much greater name recognition and financial resources than the Company. In addition, nutritional products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution. While the Company believes that consumers appreciate the convenience of ordering products from home through the Internet, the buying habits of many consumers accustomed to purchasing products through traditional retail channels are difficult to change. The Company's product offerings are also relatively small compared to the wide variety of products offered by many other nutritional product companies.

Marketing Plan

The Company signed a new lease agreement effective March 1, 2020 to open a New York office to expand its business in the New York market. The office is intended to be used as the training center for market development. The Company will focus on promoting its new product (ReMage Power) in the New York market. ReMage Power is a nutritional supplement which provides anti-aging Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ support and promotes energy and cell metabolism.  However, due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) cases continue to surge throughout the United States, we did not utilize the training center since the beginning of the lease.  Due to the outbreak of new variants of coronavirus, we kept the training center closed and did not utilize the training center in 2021. We will reopen our New York office after the pandemic eases off and use it for promoting our new product, a hair dye with gentle formula into the market.

As COVID-19 resurges with different variants, at-home COVID test kits are in a high demand, and have become the latest market trend that appears to grow for the coming years because they are relatively simple to perform with the immediacy of test results. The Company is in the process of establishing close working relationships with the suppliers to find its position in this new market.

As the increased beauty and health demand of women, the Company plans to expand the beauty industry market by develop new beauty and anti-aging products, such as the 8D facial masks. The new products are expected to launch in April 2022. The Company also plans to develop a new supplement that can help with the testosterone levels that is expected to be officially launched in June 2022. 

In the second quarter of 2022, the Company plans to launch a new gentle formula hair dye product with high technology which is friendly to sensitive skin and has rich and long-lasting color. They are easy to use and can cover gray hair in only 5 minutes. The products are planned to sell in US and Asian stores.

The majority of the Company’s sales on nutritional and beauty products were generated from China for the years ended December 31, 2021and 2020.

We believe that consumers have become more confident in ordering products like ours over the Internet. However, the nutritional supplement and skin care product e-business markets have been, and continue to be, increasingly competitive, and are rapidly evolving. 

The Company mainly rely on its CEO’s network and business relationships in the industry to approach potential customers for its OEM and packaging business in fiscal year 2021 and 2020. 

Share Distribution Plans

On June 30, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the grant of up to 6.67 million shares (from authorized but unissued shares of the Company’s common stock) to persons outside the U.S. who sell Company products, based on their sales performance in the future. The Company must determine that this type of incentive compensation is legal and appropriate for each country in which it is utilized. For ease of administration, this plan has been, and will continue to be, implemented solely for persons outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933.

As of December 31, 2021, 21,500 shares were issued to the Company’s sales agents outside the U.S. in 2018.

We also recognize the importance of keeping our employees safe. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and have followed local government orders to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
