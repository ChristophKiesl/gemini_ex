Overview
Formation.
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on April 22, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). We are an emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. We believe that there are many target companies that could become attractive public companies we intend to focus on industries that complement our management team’s background, and to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify and acquire a business, focusing on the oil and gas sectors, where our management team has extensive experience.
Our management team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Dato’ Maznah Binti Abdul Jalil, who has over 30 years of investment banking experience in a merchant Bank and DRB-HICOM Berhad Group of Companies.

BHD, since November 2017, and Pavilion REIT Management SDN. BHD, since July 2011. From December 2012 until April 2019, she was the Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer of Sona Petroleum Berhad. From 2007 to 2011 she held two positions, one as Executive Vice President at Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad and as Head of Corporate Finance at Hong Leong Financial Group. Prior to that she worked 14 years as Senior Group Director in Corporate Finance & Advisory at DRB-HICOM BERHAD (From June 1992 to July 2005) where she was responsible of corporate finance & advisory work for Master-Carriage Group and DRB-HICOM Group including restructuring proposals of companies’ mergers and acquisitions floatation of companies and overseeing investment related activities of the Group.

Business Combination Agreement with Liberty Onshore Energy. 
On December 22, 2022, we entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement effective December 15, 2022 (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with Liberty Onshore Energy B.V., a Dutch private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) (“PubCo”), Liberty Onshore Resources B.V., a Dutch private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid (“HoldCo”), LIBY Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Merger Sub”), and Markmore Energy (Labuan) Limited (“Markmore”). The Company and Markmore are collectively referred to herein as the “Parties” and individually as a “Party.”
The Business Combination Agreement provides that on the Closing Date (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with Liberty Resources Acquisition Corp. being the Surviving Company of the Merger (the “Surviving Company”) and ultimately a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo, (ii) as a result of the Merger (a) each Liberty Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive one B Share (“B Shares”), and (b) each Liberty Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time will be assumed by PubCo and, subject to the terms of the Warrant Agreement and any amendments thereto, thereafter exercisable to purchase one (1) B Share; and (iii) PubCo will pay to the former holders Markmore Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Share Exchange Effective Time the Cash Consideration. As a result of the Merger, we shall provide an opportunity to Liberty Shareholders to have their outstanding Liberty Common Shares redeemed on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and Liberty’s Organizational Documents in connection with obtaining the Liberty Shareholder Approval.

Initial Public Offering.
The Company’s sponsor is Liberty Fields LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”). The registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on November 3, 2021. On November 8, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000, including the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional Units.
Simultaneously with the consummation of the closing of the Offering, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 530,275 units (the “Placement Units”) to the Sponsor at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $5,302,750 (the “Private Placement”). The Placement Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
A total of $116,725,000, comprised of the proceeds from the Offering and the proceeds of private placements that closed on November 8, 2021, net of the underwriting commissions, discounts, and offering expenses, was deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders.
First Amendment to Acquisition Letter. 
On August 5, 2022, we entered into a binding amendment to the previously executed nonbinding acquisition letter dated May 16, 2022, by and among the Company, Caspi Oil Gas LLP (“Caspi”) and Caspi’s owner, Markmore Energy (Labuan) Limited (“Markmore”) that, among other things, made a previously executed nonbinding acquisition letter (as amended, the “Acquisition Letter”) for a transaction (the “Transaction”) that will result in Caspi becoming a publicly traded company into a binding agreement. Under the Acquisition Letter, Caspi would not engage in discussions relating to, or enter into any agreement for, any merger, financing, or similar transaction until after 5:00 p.m., New York Time on September 15, 2022 (the “exclusivity period”), and the parties would use their reasonable best efforts to execute a business combination agreement for the Transaction on or before the termination of the exclusivity period.
Second Amendment to Acquisition Letter. 
On September 21, 2022, we entered into a Second Amendment to the Acquisition Letter which extended the “Due Diligence Period” and the “Exclusivity Period” for a transaction under the Acquisition Letter (the “Transaction”) to October 15, 2022.
Third Amendment to Acquisition Letter.

Our Business Strategy
We believe that acquiring a leading high-growth company or assets in the natural resources, oil, or gas industry will provide a platform to fund consolidation and fuel growth for our company. There is no restriction in the geographic location of targets we can pursue, although we intend to initially prioritize Central Asia as the geographical focus. Our aim is to become a mid-size independent operator targeting producing onshore assets with attractive fiscal regimes and offers a high dividend policy
We believe that there is a large pool of quality initial business combination targets looking for exit opportunities with an increasing number of private equity (or PE) and venture capital (or VC) activities in the certain regions, which provides us opportunities given what we believe are the limited exit options for mid-market companies in the region. We believe that there are many resources in Central Asia that have been left stranded because domestic investors have less access to cheap capital. This is reflected in the high interest rates in a number of prospective regions, as indicated below:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​
-----------+---+-------+--
Kazakhstan | | 16.75 | %
Uzbekistan | | 14.0 | %
Azerbaijan | | 8.5 | %
Tajikistan | | 13.0 | %
Kyrgyzstan | | 13.0 | %

​
In addition, these same countries face volatile exchange rates, further increasing the difficulty in securing foreign funding / loans.
As noted, we believe that the natural resources industry, specifically the oil and gas sectors, represent a particularly attractive deal sourcing environment that will allow us to leverage our team’s skill sets and experience to identify an initial business combination which can potentially serve as a strong platform for future add-on acquisitions. Our investment thesis is supported by what we believe are the following trends in our target sectors:
Strong Core Industry Fundamental: Despite the uncertainties, we believe that the U.S. oil and gas sectors can be profitably developed and/or produced at low break-even costs. As such, drilling and other exploration and production focused investments will continue to present viable opportunities to investors in 2021. Additionally, we believe that natural gas is generally viewed as a bridge fuel to more sustainable and environmentally friendly forms of electrical generation. The U.S. has recently become a leader in natural gas resource development and is a growing LNG exporter. We believe that investors have fundamentally changed their investment criteria for the exploration and production industry from high production growth targets to disciplined growth, focusing primarily on total returns and returns of cash to investors. The U.S. upstream sector is in a period of evolutionary change. We believe that the operators that accept the new climate and evolve to meet the challenges of 2021 and beyond will emerge successfully, strengthened by their resilient business models in the face of commodity price fluctuations, and serve a vital role in providing for the world’s energy needs.
Targeting of Fastest Growing Industries. The main industry we are targeting is the natural resources industry, specifically the oil and gas sectors. This is not just a function of our expertise in these fields, but it is also because these sectors are highly fragmented with hundreds of companies ranging from large established corporations to smaller start-ups. Many non-investment grade companies have struggled with excess leverage and have been forced to restructure their operations, while other companies have sought to reduce their leverage through asset sales. Historically, the exploration and production industry has used asset sales as one of its key sources of funding. The lack of access to capital and an active M&A market lead us to believe that many companies within our target industries currently lack the financial health and operating capabilities to succeed in today’s environment.
Lack of Competition. Recent sustained low commodity prices have deeply impacted the financial health and access to capital for both public and private companies within our target sectors. We believe the exodus of capital providers and changing market sentiments have created an opportunity for natural resources focused SPACs to fill the void and pursue acquisition targets in a buyer’s market.
Operator-Led SPACs outperform their Sectors: According to McKinsey & Company, SPACs that are led by executives with past C-Suite experience tend to outperform other SPACs (by about 40%) and their industry peers (by about 10%) after at least 18 months of publicly available trading data.

Our Acquisition Criteria
Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We have used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, though, if the Business Combination Agreement with Liberty Onshore Energy does not close, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with:

● | Target Size: Consistent with our investment thesis as described above, we plan to target businesses with total enterprise values ranging from $200.0 million to $2.0 billion in the natural resources industry, specifically within the oil and gas sectors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ownership: Liberty plans to outsource most of its downstream activities and prefers to use cash for dividends payments or new fields acquisition. We also propose to pursue an asset light policy while maintaining an optimal asset ownership plan. But at the same time, we will maintain a high degree of management control over the assets within acquired fields. Such an asset light strategy offers higher profit and greater flexibility for the Company.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Businesses with Revenue and Earnings Growth Potential. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of increased production capacity, expense reduction, and synergistic follow-on acquisitions resulting in increased operating leverage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Businesses with Potential for Strong Free Cash Flow Generation. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential to generate strong, stable, and increasing free cash flow. We intend to focus on one or more businesses that have predictable revenue streams and definable low working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We may also seek to prudently leverage this cash flow in order to enhance stockholder value.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong Management. We will seek companies with strong management teams already in place. We will spend significant time assessing a company’s leadership and human fabric and maximizing its efficiency over time.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefit from Being a Public Company. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that will benefit from being publicly traded and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Appropriate Valuations and Upside Potential. We intend to apply rigorous, criteria-based, disciplined, and valuation-centric metrics. We intend to acquire a target on terms that we believe provide significant upside potential while seeking to limit risk to our investors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that from time to time our management may deem relevant.
Our Acquisition Process
In evaluating a potential target business, we believe we have conducted a comprehensive due diligence review to seek to determine a company’s quality and its intrinsic value. That due diligence review included, among other things, financial statement analysis, detailed document reviews, technology diligence, multiple meetings with management, consultations with relevant industry and academic experts, competitors, customers and suppliers, as well as a review of additional information that we obtained as part of our analysis of a target company.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from either an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Furthermore, in the event that we seek such a business combination, we expect that the independent members of our board of directors would be involved in the process for considering and approving the transaction.

10




Members of our management team, including our officers and directors, directly or indirectly own our securities and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target company is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Each of our officers and directors, as well as our management team, may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination, including if the retention or resignation of any such officers, directors, and management team members was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to such business combination.
We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target.
Each of our directors, director nominees and officers presently have and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or complete our initial business combination.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company, and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.
Our founder, sponsor, officers, and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination and their respective participation in any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in respect of determining to which such company a particular business combination opportunity should be presented, particularly in the event there is overlap among the investment mandates of such companies. Additionally, one of our directors, Mr. Stein, has invested in other blank check companies. We do not believe Mr. Stein’s investments would affect our ability to identify and pursue business opportunities or complete our initial business combination.
Moreover, because our management team has significant experience in identifying and executing multiple acquisition opportunities simultaneously and we are not limited by industry or geography in terms of the acquisition opportunities we can pursue, except with respect to our prohibition from seeking target acquisitions in China and Hong Kong. In addition, our founder, sponsor, officers, and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.
Initial Business Combination
Nasdaq rules require that we complete one or more initial business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination.
If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects.

11




We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business for the post-acquisition company to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target or assets sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for the purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.
The net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the placement units released to us from the trust account upon the closing of our initial business combination may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may use the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account following the closing for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. In addition, we may be required to obtain additional financing in connection with the closing of our initial business combination to be used following the closing for general corporate purposes as described above.
There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. None of our sponsors, officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. We may also obtain financing prior to the closing of our initial business combination to fund our working capital needs and transaction costs in connection with our search for and completion of our initial business combination.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will be prohibited from issuing additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account; or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares: (a) on any initial business combination, or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to: (x) extend the time we have to consummate a business combination, or (y) amend the foregoing provisions, unless (in connection with any such amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation) we offer our public stockholders the opportunity to redeem their public shares.
