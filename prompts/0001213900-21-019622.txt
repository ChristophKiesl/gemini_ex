Our Industry
 
Advances in technology and communications architectures as well as the robust demand outlook of the telecommunication and technology industry is generating remarkable spending trends at top tier carriers and enterprise customers. Innovative new technologies, rising network utilization and dwindling broadband capacity are fueling the fundamental need for infrastructure expansion. The adoption of next generation technologies, quality of service and network availability will be key drivers in enabling service providers to enjoy continued subscriber growth and market competitiveness.
 
Wireless infrastructure which has been in place since the 1980’s includes towers, buildings, telephone poles and other facilities to place critical antennas and associated electronics to support a wind range of wireless protocols including WiMax, LTE and now 5G technologies. These wireless trends combined with the wireline transition from copper to fiber, and its corresponding order of magnitude change in bandwidth, are occurring to satisfy the world’s ever-increasing demand for data, which are significant long term drivers of our business model and continued success. According to iSuppli, 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) will garner the largest share of wireless infrastructure capital spending through 2019 with 5G enhanced mobile technologies trials commencing in the United States in 2017 and deployment past 2025. This important transition will accelerate migration to the next generation standard that allows for higher capacity, lower latency, and the architecture required to support new applications. The roll-out of enhanced mobile broadband, small cell architectures, 5G services and billions of new Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices greatly increases the need to modernize networks to accommodate this new breed of connectivity. This long-term trend is a significant enduring opportunity for companies like ours. The transition from trial-based deployments of 5G to a full nationwide implementation is expected to continue beyond 2025. Necessary investments in supporting infrastructure such as fiber optic backhaul is expected by Deloitte Consulting LLP to require $130-$150 Billion over the next 5-7 years to adequately support the consumer demand for broadband and wireless densification projects in the United States alone. It is mission-critical for these providers to deliver broadband capacity, reliably, securely and cost-effectively in a solution that supports the massive for data consumption of emerging applications such as: augmented reality/virtual reality, video streaming, mobile advertising, IoT, self-driving cars, personalized health monitoring and much more. The explosion of devices harnessing distributed mobility will require, innovative approaches like small cell deployments to handle the increased demands on both the wireline and wireless delivery networks.
 
The outlook indicator and anticipated growth in the telecommunications sector is at a faster rate over the next five (5) years to 2025 than experienced in the previous five (5) year period. Industry revenue is forecasted for the next five (5) years is to grow at an annual rate between 5%-7%. As a result, major carriers and enterprises are increasingly requiring rapid deployment of broadband solutions and network infrastructure upgrades to support an evolving array of communication technologies that attempt to cope with the mounting demand for higher mobile traffic capacity and coverage.

Competitors
 
We provide, professional and infrastructure services to carriers, service provider, utilities and enterprise clients on a national and international basis. Our primary business market is somewhat consolidated, and the business is characterized by several large companies, however the market servicing the telecommunications sector is fragmented with a large number of small, privately held, local competitors.
 
Our current and potential larger competitors include MasTec, Dycom Industries, Inc., Goodman Networks, Inc., Ericsson, and Black and Veatch. A significant portion of our services revenue is currently derived from MSAs and price is often an important factor in awarding such agreements. Accordingly, our competitors may underbid us if they elect to price their services aggressively to procure such business. It must be recognized that while these companies are competitors, under the right circumstance they are also our clients or potential clients. Our competitors may also develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position based on thresholds for margin and profitability that has been established as benchmarks within our telecommunications division. The principal competitive factors for our professional services include; agility to respond, geographic presence, breadth of service offerings, technical skills “in-house” professional licenses, price, quality of service, safety record, proven performance and industry reputation. We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of all of these factors.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
On the telecommunication sector we believe our market advantage is the long-term relationships, Master Service Agreements (MSAs), industry leading provider of wireless and wireline solutions and a reputations and track record of our ability to perform with agility, quality on a seamless and flawless manner for our clients is key in our success to date. Spectrum Global’s ability to provide a wide range of services in a turn-key integrated solution is critical to our clients. Our highly experienced and professional team provide such services as: RF, civil, electrical, architectural engineering and design, structural engineering, analysis and design, value engineering, network engineering services, network planning, site acquisition, land use planning, feasibility/environmental studies, lease/contract negotiations, Build-To-Suit (BTS) services, audits functions, program planning, professional services, product development, construction and installation, technical services, warehouse and logistics, network decommissioning and maintenance.
 
We believe our additional strengths described below will enable us to continue to compete effectively and to take advantage of anticipated growth in the telecommunications industry segment:
 

● | Service Provider Relationships: We have established relationships with leading wireless and wireline telecommunications providers, cable broadband MSOs, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), utility companies, Project Management Organizations (PMOs), enterprise clientele and others.

Our Growth Strategy
 

● | Under the leadership of our senior management team, we intend to continue to build our operational groups, invest in our sales/account management resources and continue to market our capabilities to support our rapid growth focusing on optimizing our operating margins. While organic growth will be a continued main focus in our telecommunications division to drive our business forward, acquisitions will play a strategic role in augmenting existing product and service lines, expanding geographic reach, diversifying customers and cross-selling opportunities. We are pursuing several strategies, including:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand Engineering and Telecom Offerings. We are building a company that can manage the existing network infrastructures of the largest domestic and international service providers, utilities, aggregators, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM’s) and Project Management Organizations (PMO’s) while delivering a broad range of professional services to meet accelerated demand for these services. We believe the ability to provide such solutions and services is a critical differentiator as we already have relationships for these professional services in place today. Each of our operating units within Spectrum Global intends to continue to expand into additional service offerings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Grow Revenues and Market Share through Selective Acquisitions. We plan to continue to acquire private companies that enhance our earnings and offer complementary services plus expand our geographic reach and client base. We believe such acquisitions will help us to accelerate our revenue growth, leverage our existing strengths, and capture and retain more work “in-house” from our clients, thereby contributing to our profitability. We also believe that increased scale will enable us to bid and take on larger project and contracts. We believe there are potential acquisition candidates in the somewhat fragmented professional services market and infrastructure arena which would be likely candidates for consolidation opportunities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Aggressively Expand Our Organic Growth Initiatives. Our customers include leading wireless and wireline telecommunications providers, cable broadband MSOs, OEMs, Utility Entities, technology and enterprise customers. As we have expanded the breadth of our service offerings through both organic growth and selective acquisitions, we believe we have opportunities to expand revenues with our existing clients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand Our Relationships with New Service Providers. We plan to capture and expand new relationships with cable broadband providers, competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), Fortune 1000 enterprise clients, institutional clients, competitive access providers (CAPs), etc. We believe that the business model for the expansion of these relationships, leveraging our core strengths, experience and broad array of service solutions, will support our business model for organic growth.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase Operating Margins by Leveraging Operating Efficiencies. We believe that by centralizing administrative functions, consolidating insurance coverage and eliminating redundancies across our newly acquired businesses, we will be positioned to offer more integrated end-to-end solutions and increase operating margins.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cross Selling and Marketing. We believe that through our acquisitions we will be able to effectively cross sell between business units and enhanced services offerings and gain even greater traction through coordinated and branded marketing indicatives.

Customers
 
Our customers include many Fortune 1000 enterprises, wireless and wireline service providers, cable broadband MSOs and telecommunications OEMs. Our current service provider and OEM customers include leading telecommunications companies, such as Ericsson, Inc., Verizon Communications, T-Mobile/Sprint Corporation and AT&T.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, our top four customers, Ericsson, Inc., Frontier Communications, CBM of America, Inc., and Sullivan & Powers, Inc. accounted for approximately 66% of our total revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our top four customers, Ericsson, Inc., AT&T, SAC Wireless, and Frontier Communications accounted for approximately 82% of our total revenues.
 
A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from work performed under multi-year master service agreements and multi-year service contracts. We have entered into master service agreements, or MSAs, with numerous service providers and OEMs, and generally have multiple agreements with each of our customers. MSAs are generally the contracting vehicle with work awarded primarily through a competitive bidding process based on the depth of our service offerings, experience, price, geographic coverage and capacity. MSAs generally contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discrete pricing for individual tasks, but do not require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services. To the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity, there are often a number of exceptions, including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers, perform work with the customer’s own employees and use other service providers. Most of our MSAs may be cancelled by our customers upon minimum notice (typically 60 days), regardless of whether we are or are not in default. In addition, many of these contracts permit cancellation of particular purchase orders or statements of work without any prior notice but do allow for payment for services performed up to the point of hold or cancellation.
