OVERVIEW

FalconStor is a data protection leader that enables enterprises to modernize their data backup and archival operations across sites and public clouds, delivering increased data security and providing fast recovery from a ransomware attack while driving down costs by up to 90 percent. A proven technology leader with 47 patents and patent applications, FalconStor has over an exabyte of data under management and is trusted by more than 600 enterprise customers and an ecosystem of managed service providers and resellers worldwide.
Our products are utilized by enterprises and managed service providers across the globe and address two key areas of enterprise data protection; long-term data retention and recovery, and business continuity driven data replication. Our innovative integration with modern cloud-based data storage environments, such as AWS and Microsoft Azure, enables our customers to significantly reduce costs, and improve the portability, security, and accessibility of their enterprise data. This accessibility is key in our modern world, where data is not only protected, but also intelligently leveraged to facilitate learning, improve product design, and drive competitive advantage. Our products are software-defined, which means that our technology allows our solutions to be hardware, cloud, and source-data agnostic, giving our customers maximum leverage of existing hardware and software investments.
The enterprise data protection segments in which we focus our attention are critical to the data protection plans of any enterprise. First, the absolute foundation of any enterprise data protection plan is based on long-term data archive, as this segment represents up to 80% of an enterprise’s data according to a 2019 Horizon Information Strategies study. Whether in the form of application databases, documents, emails, or digital media files, an enterprise is mandated to preserve these information assets for lengthy periods of time to fulfill operational, legal, and regulatory requirements. In fact, expanding government and industry regulations continue to increase mandated retention periods, which now exceed one hundred years in certain cases. In addition, beyond fundamental data retention, modern enterprises desire to leverage their long-term archives for strategic analysis and to unlock new revenue streams. As a result, enterprises are challenged with securely and cost effectively managing this data, while also adopting flexible and scalable cloud-based storage environments. Our long-term data retention products enable our customers to reduce their data storage footprint by up to 95% and seamlessly transition data to a wide-array of hybrid-cloud and public-cloud storage, including AWS and Microsoft Azure.
Second, in addition to their long-term data archive foundation, an enterprise must maintain operational data redundancy for specific data assets to ensure near real-time business continuity. Our data replication products and associated technologies allow an enterprise to capture snapshots of selected data or entire systems at user-defined intervals and include the ability to replicate data continuously as it is written or modified in real-time. These solutions allow our enterprise customers to recover data back to a specific millisecond in time to completely recover from operational data loss or corruption, including ransomware. As with our long-term data retention products, our business continuity driven data replication products are designed to leverage existing enterprise hardware and software investments, while seamlessly enabling the use of new cloud-based data storage technologies.

Our products are available and supported worldwide by a network of leading service providers, systems integrators, resellers, managed services providers, and OEMs.  

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

Enterprises of all sizes are increasingly challenged to securely archive, replicate, and make available their data assets. Their challenge is increased as business pressures to reduce cost and increase efficiency push the enterprise to adopt cloud-based technologies, which are critical to handling the growth in data and strategic uses of enterprise data. 

Long-term data archive is the fastest-growing segment of an enterprise’s data assets. This growth is accelerating as enterprises are increasingly subject to complex regulatory compliance, such as that driven by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As the volume of long-term archive continues to expand, the need for enterprises to securely and cost-effectively store the associated data will only increase.

Traditionally, enterprises have stored their long-term archives within physical tape libraries or on disc-based storage connected directly to internal servers. However, new distributed storage technologies, and hybrid and public cloud-based 
environments, such as AWS and Microsoft Azure, have created additional cost-effective and scalable options for archive storage. Movement to the cloud can be inhibited by many factors, but dealing with the complexity of the legacy environment, and the costs of data storage in the cloud are two areas where we provide differentiated capability built over many years of customer engagement and innovation. We believe for larger enterprise clients that this represents a significant portion of the available market.

The introduction of new long-term archive storage options has also given rise to a growth in managed service providers (MSPs) remotely managing data protection, primarily to smaller enterprises with a less complex array of data assets. The MSPs are able to leverage modern broadband connectivity and offer more scalable long-term storage options, which will serve to reduce data protection costs for their customers. We believe this trend to outsourced long-term archive data protection will continue.

OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SUPPORTING TECHNOLOGY

FalconStor’s software products create investment protection, flexibility, and leverage of modern cloud-based technologies, through software-defined functionality that provides backup and long-term retention, and business continuity driven data replication. As a result, our enterprise clients are able to utilize the underlying storage hardware, media, or environment (on-premise or cloud) that best aligns with their strategic needs. Our customers utilize our products to protect data residing in physical, virtual, private-cloud, public-cloud, and multi-cloud environments, and give our them the freedom to optimize their data protection infrastructure and eliminate costly hardware-vendor, cloud, and form-factor lock-in.
Long-Term Data Retention and Recovery Products

FalconStor Virtual Tape Library (“VTL”) - FalconStor was an early innovator in Virtual Tape Library (“VTL”) technology, which allows enterprise customers to emulate and replace cumbersome legacy physical tape libraries for archive related data preservation, without being forced to replace their enterprise backup and archive software and associated processes.

Our VTL product continues to be a leading virtual tape library solution, and we believe it is unmatched in terms of performance and scalability. With VTL, our enterprise customers are able to complete their data archive operations more reliably, with minimal change needed to the legacy archive environment. They are also able to leverage sophisticated physical tape emulation, advanced data security, data-deduplication, and public- or private-cloud based virtual tape archive storage, which are all now seamlessly integrated into our solution. We are dedicated to providing our enterprise customers with the highest performing VTL product in the industry. As such, we subject our VTL solution to independent performance testing, which has demonstrated that our product is 25% faster than the closest competitor and can be executed on hardware that is 1/3 the cost of that required by our closest competitor.

Beyond allowing our customers to benefit from sheer data archive speed, we also enable them to dramatically reduce the amount of data that needs to be archived, by processing their archive data through our integrated data deduplication engine. By eliminating redundant archive data, the archive storage capacity required can be reduced by as much as 95%. Our technology allows our enterprise customers to significantly reduce the cost of storing the ever-growing volume of data subject to long-term archive data protection mandates. 

FalconStor StorSafeTM (“StorSafe”) - Traditionally, enterprises have had limited choice and have been forced to store their archive data on physical tape or within storage arrays installed in an internal data center. Our newest and most innovative long-term archive data management software product, StorSafe, breaks these traditional storage limitations and enables enterprises to securely and cost effectively leverage a wide array of storage options, including ultra efficient and scalable cloud-based storage environments, such as AWS and Azure.
Launched in 2020, StorSafe, like our proven VTL solution, provides sophisticated physical tape emulation and seamless integration with an enterprise’s legacy backup and archive software and processes. In addition, StorSafe includes our advanced data deduplication technology. However, StorSafe takes long-term archive storage optimization to an entirely new and innovative level. By leveraging patent pending industry-standard Container technology to enable persistent long-term archive storage, our StorSafe solution dramatically improves archive data portability, accessibility, security, and integrity validation, especially as it relates to multi-cloud data storage leverage. As a result, a full spectrum of archive data storage options is made available to our enterprise customers to efficiently utilize essentially any storage environment, while confidently ensuring data security and efficient archive access. 
We have designed StorSafe to significantly reduce long-term archive data storage and legal or regulatory mandated compliance costs and redefine long-term archive storage optimization and accessibility for the next decade.

Business Continuity Driven Data Replication Products

The FalconStor StorGuardTM (“StorGuard”) Suite includes the functionality of the following point solutions.
FalconStor Continuous Data Protector (“CDP”)

In addition to retaining long-term archive data, enterprises routinely maintain short-term copies, or backups, of data generated by various user applications, to protect against data loss or natural disaster. FalconStor CDP technology reinvents the way data replication and recovery are implemented and performed. Moving beyond once-a-day backup models, CDP combines local and remote protection into a cost-effective, unified, disk-based solution that allows organizations to recover data back to the most recent transaction. Combining application-aware snapshot agents and continuous journaling functions, CDP enables customers to recover data effectively at any point in time. CDP delivers instant data availability and reliable recovery, bringing business applications back online in a matter of minutes after a failure. CDP protects application-specific data for Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and other business applications, ensuring high performance and stability for even the most complex business environments.

FalconStor Network Storage Server (“NSS”)

The ever expanding capacity of data managed by enterprises creates a continual challenge in ensuring the organization has an adequate amount of available storage. FalconStor NSS is a scalable, highly available solution that enables data storage virtualization and business continuity in heterogeneous environments. Supporting existing third-party disk arrays, NSS eliminates storage boundaries and vendor lock-in, providing fast and secure data storage provisioning and migration. From a small iSCSI virtual server lab to an enterprise-class Fiber Channel SAN running Tier-1 database applications, NSS is designed to meet the data storage needs of any enterprise.

Moving data between different data storage platforms can be complex, complicated, time-consuming, and disruptive to business operations. Our core storage virtualization technology provides a non-disruptive approach to data mobility across different SAN protocols and vendors. With NSS, it becomes a simple operation to move data from older platforms to newer ones or to introduce new storage capacity and tiers. This allows enterprises to respond to evolving performance and capacity requirements, as well as changing data protection mandates.

Our products are sold as stand-alone software, but can also be bundled with standard hardware configurations to simplify implementation for our customers.
 Supporting Technology

Our core long-term archive and business continuity driven products are complemented by a set of underlying technologies that streamline usability and overall solution performance.
FalconStor StorSightTM (“StorSight”)
StorSight gives our enterprise customers and MSPs the ability to administer long-term archive and business continuity driven data replication from one centralized management point and to easily test additional FalconStor products they may not be currently licensing. Prior to Q4 2019, our products were managed through two different user consoles; a Java-based console for VTL, and a modern HTML-based console (branded initially as FreeStorTM) for CDP and NSS. To simplify our development efforts and to enable broader use of our products by our enterprise customers, we have unified all user management into our modern HTML-based console and rebranded that unified tool as StorSight. As a result, StorSight is now our unified data protection console used to administer our VTL, StorSafe, CDP, and NSS products.

Our StorSight user console provides deep analytics relative to each FalconStor product as they are utilized in production. StorSight also includes a full array of functionality key to our MSP customers, such as multi-tenancy and charge-back.

StorSight usage licensing is included when customers and MSPs license any FalconStor product.
 FalconStor RecoverTracTM (“RecoverTrac”) Disaster Recovery Technology

Our patented RecoverTrac technology streamlines the implementation, testing, and execution of disaster recovery operations. It minimizes service failover time between sites and reduces disaster recovery costs by offering full recovery from physical-to-physical, virtual-to-virtual, and physical-to-virtual server infrastructures. This technology is a disaster recovery automation service, and is included as a standard feature of the FalconStor NSS and the FalconStor CDP products to automate complex, time-consuming, and error-prone failover and failback operations of systems, applications, services, and entire data centers. This technology can also work across those environments, enabling organizations to seamlessly migrate locally, remotely, or to and from cloud environments.

FalconStor MicroScanTM (“MicroScan”) Technology

The patented FalconStor MicroScan technology minimizes the amount of data transferred during replication by eliminating inefficiencies at the application and file system layer. Data changes are replicated at the smallest possible level of granularity, reducing LAN/WAN bandwidth and associated storage costs for disaster recovery (DR), and any time data is replicated from one source to another. Typical storage array-based solutions replicate changes track-by-track. This means that even when the smallest possible data change is made (512 bytes or one disk sector), the file system will write 8K of data, and the array will send the entire track (typically 32KB in size) or four times more than the file system change. In contrast, if MicroScan scans 8K of “new” data and concludes that only 512 bytes (1 disk sector) have truly changed. Only the 512-byte change is sent over the LAN/WAN network, making it 64 times more efficient than sending the full track. As a result, for every one terabyte needing to be sent over the network, FalconStor CDP or FalconStor NSS only needs to send 16 gigabytes. MicroScan is an integral part of the FalconStor replication option for CDP and NSS.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

FalconStor‘s products and supporting technologies serve enterprise IT organizations and managed service providers worldwide and are guided by the following strategies. 

Provide a Bridge to Cloud-Based Data Storage, While Protecting Investments

As enterprise IT organizations look to modernize their long-term archive and business continuity related data replication, they are challenged by the cost, risk, and disruption upgrades and migrations can cause. Because FalconStor abstracts the data protection services from the physical storage infrastructure, additional capabilities can be added to legacy hardware, eliminating the need and cost to replace that hardware. This delivers discrete value in terms of lowering capital and operational costs, reduced risk and disruption, and significantly faster time to deployment. For IT organizations wishing to deploy new hardware or storage paradigms, including the utilization of private- or public-cloud based storage, such as AWS or Azure, our products enable the migration and on-going optimization of data storage to and on those new platforms, versus being forced to start with a new or “greenfield” deployment required by many of the latest hardware vendors. FalconStor offers these organizations a path forward with an approach that minimizes or eliminates risk and disruption to business processes and workflows while lowering both capital and operational costs.

FalconStor intends to continue leveraging the protocol-independent, full featured, unified architecture, analytics, and robust open data services technology of its products to maintain a leadership position in the enterprise storage software market. With the addition of StorSafe, and its associated storage container technology, FalconStor has joined and is dedicated to the Open Source community, which has accelerated development and integration efforts across our entire product suite. FalconStor plans to continue its leadership in this market by delivering technical innovation that creates investment protection, flexibility, and leverage of modern cloud-based technologies for our enterprise customers.

Enable Managed Service Providers

As the managed service provider segment continues to grow, they increasingly have a need to support heterogeneous storage environments across their own data centers and their customer’s environments. Further, MSPs often have different hardware and software capabilities, making it significantly challenging to offer consistent data services across these environments. We believe FalconStor offers several strategic benefits for MSPs:

•Enables the seamless and non-disruptive movement of data from the customer premise to the service provider’s hosted environment;
•Offers common data services across customer’s environments regardless of underlying hardware or technology;
•Allows for the introduction and ability to monetize additional data services they may not have previously been able to offer;
•Provides a low-cost growth opportunity due to the flexibility of StorSight licensing, while eliminating the need to have multiple feature licenses array by array;
•Enables reduced storage management complexity and costs within their infrastructure by eliminating silos, reducing licensing costs and optimizing hardware;
•Optimizes storage hardware based on price/performance needs of customers; and
•Provides analytics for necessary real-time and historical information to achieve SLA's and make economic decisions.

Expand Software and Hardware Strategic Alliances with Industry Leaders

The Flash/SSD, High-Density Shingle Disk, and Cloud Data Archival markets should be key opportunities for us on two fronts: targeting customers wanting to integrate new Flash/SSD, High-Density Shingle Disk, Cloud Data Archival technology into existing IT environments, and OEMs needing to enhance their software stack in order to offer data movement and protection services on their platform. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) such as AWS, Azure, Wasabi, and Aliyun also represent a growth opportunity. Our mutual customers and partners need help moving data from the customer site to their own facilities as well as a way to deliver common data services across disparate and often incompatible hardware typically found across the provider and end customer environments. We believe FalconStor is positioned to continue to take advantage of these key opportunities in the global marketplace. Our strategic relationships with Hitachi Data Systems, Hitachi Vantara, Fujitsu, DSI, and others should fuel growth across all three major geographies.
Expanded Existing Product Offerings

We will continue to enhance our products to address the ever-changing market dynamics to ensure that FalconStor can be a leader in the data protection marketplace.

StorSafe is the newest innovation from FalconStor. It leverages the latest industry-standard software container technology that utilizes virtualization at the application layer versus the systems layer. This powerful differentiator allows StorSafe, the first enterprise-class, persistent storage container, to disaggregate data storage from the system-level components. With FalconStor's successful adaptation of transient container technology, it delivers a persistent, long-term data protection container that is agnostic, heterogeneous, and highly portable, as well as backward compatible and compatible with future technology advancements. It also delivers the capability to seamlessly operate across data centers, and public, private, hybrid, and multi-cloud data storage environment(s). Leveraging the power of container technologies has also allowed the development of robust active and passive features and functionality that are necessary to meet integrity, validation, and journal-based auditing. These advancements are essential to meet the chain of custody mandates that are inherent in long-term data retention plans subject to compliance, regulatory, legal discovery, and privacy laws that continue to evolve and mature.

We now also offered our capacity-based licenses on a subscription or term-based model, which gives a customer the right to utilize the licensed terabyte capacity over a designated period of time. We expect revenue from subscription-based per terabyte licensing to increase over the next several years.
COMPETITION

Long-Term Data Retention and Recovery

We believe our VTL and StorSafe products are positioned well in the marketplace. Given the fact that these products are designed to integrate with an enterprise’s legacy backup and archive software and processes, the level of competition we typically face is limited to DellEMC’s Data Domain virtual tape library product. 
One could argue that we also compete with legacy backup and archive vendors such as Veritas, and Commvault; however, in practice, our products are more complimentary to their solutions than competitive, as our solutions do not require their solutions to be retired or replaced. In fact, our enterprise customers view the ability to maintain their legacy software solutions and processes as a key differentiator for selecting FalconStor, as it is common for them to use backup and archive products from multiple vendors. By inserting our VTL or StorSafe product, they are able to aggregate all of their archive data easily and control global data deduplication and archive storage from one central point.

We believe our enterprise customers also view the fact that our VTL and StorSafe products operate effectively with Windows, Linux, and IBM i operating system (OS) environments as a key differentiator. As a result, we execute specific go-to-market efforts to identify enterprise customers that have multiple OS environments in production.

Beyond the differentiation our VTL and StorSafe products provide related to existing infrastructure integration, we also believe the innovations we are delivering to improve backup and long-term retention dramatically, will serve as important competitive differentiators for FalconStor over the next several years. This belief is founded on the fact that our new innovations are designed to significantly improve archive data portability, security, and integrity validation. In addition, our new innovations are designed to allow our enterprise customers to seamlessly leverage multiple private- or public-clouds at one time to significantly reduce archive data storage costs.

Business Continuity Driven Data Replication

Competition within the business continuity driven data replication space is significant and includes products from Veeam, Rubrik, Cohesity, Commvault, Veritas, DellEMC, DataCore, and others. As a result, it is imperative that we carefully select the areas in which we will compete to ensure they are aligned with our key product differentiations. Accordingly, our two areas of 
focus within this space are on-premise storage virtualization and granular application-aware data replication snapshots that enable our enterprise customers to recover data back to a specific millisecond in time for near real-time recovery time objectives (RTO).
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

FalconStor’s success is dependent in part upon its proprietary technology. We currently have forth seven patents and pending patent applications. The Company has multiple registered trademarks - including “FalconStor Software”, “StorSight”, “StorSafe”, and “Intelligent Abstraction” - as well as pending trademark applications related to FalconStor and its products.

FalconStor seeks to protect its proprietary rights and other intellectual property through a combination of copyright, patents, trademark, and trade secret protection, as well as through contractual protections such as proprietary information agreements and nondisclosure agreements. The technological and creative skills of its personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership.

FalconStor generally enters into confidentiality or license agreements with employees, consultants, and corporate partners and generally controls access to and distribution of its software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Despite the Company’s efforts to protect its proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use FalconStor’s products or technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of FalconStor’s products is difficult, and there can be no assurance that the steps FalconStor has taken will prevent misappropriation of its technology, particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect its proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States.

INTERNET ADDRESS AND AVAILABILITY OF FILINGS
Our internet address is www.falconstor.com. The Company makes available free of charge, on or through its Internet website, the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or (15)(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company complied with this policy for every Exchange Act (the "Exchange Act"), report filed during the year ended December 31, 2020.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Given the commercial uncertainty caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic, or COVID-19, the Company developed and implemented an even more aggressive expense control plan in March 2020, that it kept in place for the remainder of 2020. This plan reduced the Company's annual cash expense run rate by $4.0 million or 29%. The Company has furloughed 21 positions worldwide, and 20 of these positions were reinstated by the fourth quarter of 2020. We believe the reduced expense level should enable FalconStor to remain profitable during 2021, even with a prolonged impact of COVID-19 well into 2021.
