ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
We strive to be a leading platform for the operation of, and investment in, smaller and specialty market communications services and technology companies.  We have a long track record of delivering critical infrastructure-based solutions to underserved markets. Our majority-owned operating subsidiaries provide facilities-based 

1



communications services, along with related information technology solutions, in the United States, Bermuda, and the Caribbean. We also have non-controlling investments in several communications and technology companies, and we continue to consider opportunities to make controlling and minority investments in businesses that we believe have the potential for generating substantial and relatively steady cash flows over extended periods of time or have technologies or business models that might prove valuable to our main operating subsidiaries or create significant longer term growth potential for us as a whole.
​
At the holding company level, we oversee the allocation of capital within and among our subsidiaries, affiliates, minority investments, and stockholders. We also have developed significant operational expertise and resources that we use to augment the capabilities of our individual operating subsidiaries. Over the past 10 years, we have built a platform of resources and expertise to support our operating subsidiaries and to improve their quality of service, and customer acquisition, retention, and satisfaction while maintaining optimal operating efficiencies. We have a number of shared service functions, including billing, network and engineering and customer service, and the parent company also employs personnel with specialized skills that provide greater economies of scale and expertise than would typically be available at the operating subsidiary level. 
​
We were incorporated in Delaware in 1987, began trading publicly in 1991 and spun off more than half of our operations to stockholders in 1998. We actively evaluate potential acquisitions, investment opportunities and other strategic transactions, both domestic and international, that we believe have the potential for generating steady excess cash flows over extended periods of time. In addition, we consider non-controlling investments in earlier stage businesses that we consider strategically relevant, and which may offer long-term growth potential for us, either individually, or as research and development businesses that can support our operating subsidiaries in new technology, product, and service development and offerings. We have used the cash generated from our established operating units, and any asset sales, to re-invest in our existing businesses, to return cash to our investors, and to make strategic investments in additional businesses. We provide management, technical, financial, regulatory, and marketing services to our subsidiaries and typically receive a management fee equal to a percentage of their revenues, which is eliminated in consolidation. For further information about our financial segments and geographical information about our operating revenues and assets, see Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.
​
Through December 31, 2020, we had identified three operating segments to manage and review our operations and to facilitate investor presentations of our results. These three operating segments are as follows:
​

● | International Telecom. Businesses contained in our international telecom segment offer a mix of fixed data, internet and voice services (“Fixed”) as well as retail mobility (“Mobility”) services to customers in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guyana and the US Virgin Islands. We offer fixed video services in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, and the US Virgin Islands and managed information technology services (“Managed Services”) to enterprise customers in all our markets. We also offer services to other telecom providers (“Carrier Services”), such as international long-distance, transport and access services, and roaming from such telecom providers’ customers traveling in our network service areas. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | US Telecom. In the United States, primarily in the Southwest, we offer Carrier Services, including wholesale roaming services, the leasing of critical network infrastructure such as towers and transport facilities, and site maintenance. We also provide Fixed, Mobility, and Managed Services to our retail and enterprise customers, and private network services to enterprise customers, municipalities and other service providers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
●Renewable Energy. In India, we provided distributed generation solar power to commercial and industrial customers through January 27, 2021. Through November 6, 2018, we also provided distributed generation solar power in the United States in Massachusetts, California and New Jersey.
​
On December 31, 2020, we announced that we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Alaska Merger Agreement”) with Freedom 3 Capital, LLC (“Freedom3”) to acquire all of the shares of Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc. (“Alaska Communications”), a publicly listed company (Nasdaq:ALSK) for approximately $340 million, including the assumption of debt (the “Alaska Transaction”). Following the closing of the Alaska Transaction, 

2



we will, through our subsidiaries, own and control approximately 51% of Alaska Communications and Freedom3, through its affiliates, will own the remaining 49%. In February 2021, the required waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 expired, however the Alaska Transaction remains subject to customary closing terms and conditions including (i) the approval of Alaska Communications’ stockholders, (ii) the absence of certain legal impediments, and (iii) obtaining the necessary consents from the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska.
​
In January 2021, we completed the sale of 67% of the outstanding equity in our business that owns and operates distributed generation solar power projects operated under the Vibrant (“Vibrant”) name in India (the “Vibrant Transaction”). The post-sale results of our ownership interest in Vibrant will be recorded through the equity method of accounting within the Corporate and Other operating segment. As such, our consolidated financial statements will no longer include revenue and operating expenses from Vibrant, but instead, “other income (expense)” within the Corporate and Other operating segment will include our 33% share of Vibrant’s profits or losses. We will continue to present the historical results of our Renewable Energy segment for comparative purposes.
​
The operations of Vibrant did not qualify as discontinued operations because the disposition did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. 
​
The following chart summarizes the operating activities of our principal subsidiaries, the segments in which we reported our revenue and the markets we served during 2020:

​
Strategy
​
The key elements of our strategy consist of the following:
​

● | Target Underserved Markets Where We Can Compete Successfully. We operate our communications businesses primarily in smaller, rural or under-served markets where we believe we are or will be one of the leading providers of communications services. We seek opportunities to build, manage, and own critical communications infrastructure in areas of unmet need where we have the potential for generating substantial and relatively steady excess cash flows over extended periods of time. By supplementing the business with our operational capabilities and experience at the holding company level, we are able to take on unproven markets
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3




with more difficult operating or political environments at a more attractive value entry point. We strive to improve and expand our product and service offerings in the locations we serve in order to better satisfy customer needs, expand our customer bases and revenues and ensure the business is efficient and economically viable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Partner Directly with Investment Funds and Other Equity Investors. We seek opportunities to partner with investment funds and other equity investors looking to make direct investments in businesses that own and operate critical communications infrastructure. We believe we have a number of attributes that would make us an attractive partner for these funds, such as substantial operating know-how, experienced personnel, considerable resources and a long, public track record of successful management and operations of critical communications networks. We also have extensive transactional experience and a proven ability to source, develop, and exit investment opportunities and to take on the difficult task of integrating and optimizing acquired assets and businesses. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Provide Operational Expertise in Collaboration with Local Management. We believe that strong local management enhances our close relationship with customers and reduces risk. Our businesses typically have or develop strong local brand identities that help them become leaders in the markets they serve. Wherever feasible, we seek to partner with local investors, owners or management teams who have demonstrated a successful track record or have extensive knowledge of the industry or markets in which we operate, and who have local credibility. By maintaining these relationships and leveraging our comprehensive management experience and operational, technical, and financial expertise, we can assist these local management teams in further improving operations and growing their businesses. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Maintain a Disciplined Approach to Capital Allocation. We carefully assess the potential for cash flow stability and growth when we evaluate the performance of our subsidiaries, new investment opportunities, and prospective acquisitions or dispositions. In managing our more mature businesses, we seek to solidify our brands, improve customer satisfaction, add new services, control costs and preserve cash flow. In managing newer, early-stage businesses, we seek to invest capital to improve our competitive position, increase our market share and generate strong long-term revenue and cash flow potential. We consider new investments, acquisitions and dispositions on a disciplined, return-on-investment basis. In recent years, we have made several investments in earlier stage businesses whose technology-forward approach we consider strategically relevant and, in addition to the potential for creating attractive returns on our invested capital as they grow, may enhance the potential to expand our more mature businesses.

​
Communications Services
​
Our International Telecom segment generates Mobility, Fixed, Carrier Services, and Managed Services revenues in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guyana and the US Virgin Islands. Our revenues from our International Telecom segment were approximately 72% and 73% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our US Telecom segment generates Mobility, Fixed, Carrier Services, and Managed Services revenues in the mainland United States. Our revenues from our US Telecom segment were approximately 27% and 25% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.
​
International Telecom Segment
​
Mobility
​
We provide mobile, data, and voice services to retail and business customers in Bermuda under the “One” brand name, in Guyana under the “GTT+” brand name and in the US Virgin Islands under the “Viya” brand name. We also provide roaming services for many of the largest US providers’ customers visiting these locations. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 304,000 Mobility subscribers in our International Telecom segment and over 84% of those subscribers were on prepaid plans.
​

Products and Services. A significant majority of our customers in our International Telecom segment subscribe to one of our prepaid plans, which require customers to purchase an amount of voice minutes, text messages or data prior to use. A smaller minority of customers subscribe to our postpaid plans that allow customers to select a plan with voice minutes, text messaging, a given amount of data and other features that recur on a monthly basis, which services are billed at the end of the service period. 
​
Network and Operations: We offer our Mobility services over our 3G (WDCMA) 4G (LTE) wireless network in Bermuda and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In Guyana we offer our Mobility services over our 2G (GSM), 3G (WCDMA and 4G (LTE) wireless network. As of December 2020 we owned and operated a total of 454 wireless base stations in the international markets. All of our Mobility networks have their core supporting facilities in the home network in the US Virgin Islands, Bermuda and Guyana. Our local NOCs provide dedicated monitoring of our network to ensure quality and reliable service to our customers and during off hours, weekends and holidays our NOC in the mainland USA provides extended support to ensure we have 24 hours year round monitoring of all our wireless and wireline markets. In 2021 we will start the deployment of Volte in the markets and also trial and test some 5G wireless network deployments. 
​
The transport networks in all the markets are primarily fiber based with route diversity provided by the deployment of fiber rings where possible and supplemental microwave deployments. The vast majority of the networks are IP Based utilizing MPLS for redundancy to provide high availability networks. Standby power is provided by back up battery and generators. In the USVI where we have experienced extreme hurricane events lots of network hardening has been added to the network such as building tower structures to 160 MPH ratings and adding underground and alternate routes where ever possible. All the markets connect to the world thought sub-sea fiber networks described in our “International Telecom – Fixed – Network” section below.
​
Sales and Marketing. We maintain retail stores in our markets and allow customers to pay their bills and “top up,” or add additional data and/or minutes to their prepaid plans, through payment terminals at local stores, business centers or our website, by purchasing prepaid calling cards, or via mobile or web-based apps. Our handsets, prepaid cards and prepaid accounts are also sold through independent dealers that we pay on a commission basis.
​
Handsets and Accessories. We offer a diverse line of wireless devices and accessories designed to meet both the personal and professional needs of our customers. Our device assortment includes a wide range of smartphones including those featuring the Android™ and iOS™ operating systems in addition to a full line of feature phones, wireless hot spots and various wireless solutions for small businesses. To complement our phone offerings, we sell a complete range of original equipment manufacturer and after-market accessories that allow our customers to personalize their wireless experience, including phone protection, battery charging solutions and Bluetooth hands-free kits.
​
Competition. We believe we compete for wireless retail customers in our international markets based on features, price, technology deployed, network coverage (including through roaming arrangements), quality of service and customer care. We compete against Digicel and Liberty Latin America in the Caribbean region, other smaller local providers, and in some markets, against one or more US national operators.
​
Fixed Services
​
High-speed data and related services. We offer high-speed broadband services to both residential and enterprise customers in all our International Telecom markets. We provide a number of broadband internet plans with varying speeds to address different customer needs and price requirements in our various markets. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 141,000 high-speed broadband customers across our markets.
​
Voice services. We offer Fixed voice services that include local exchange, regional and long distance calling and voice messaging services in Bermuda, Guyana, and the US Virgin Islands. As of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate of approximately 169,000 access lines in service in our markets, which represent both residential and enterprise subscribers. With respect to our international long-distance business, we also collect payments from foreign carriers for handling international long-distance calls originating from the foreign carriers’ countries and terminating on 

5



our network. We also make payments to foreign carriers for international calls originating on one of our networks and terminating in the foreign carrier’s countries and collect from our subscribers or a local originating carrier a rate that is market-based or set by regulatory tariff.
​
Video services. We offer video services in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, and the US Virgin Islands. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 36,000 video customers across our markets. We have several offerings available to our video customers, including basic and tiered local and cable TV channels grouped into various content categories, such as news, sports and entertainment.
​
Network. We also offer our Fixed services over our coaxial cable and fiber-optic networks in our international markets. All of our Fixed access lines are digitally switched from our switching centers in the US Virgin Islands, Bermuda and Guyana. Our switching centers provide dedicated monitoring of our network to ensure quality and reliable service to our customers.
​
In Bermuda and the US Virgin Islands, we deliver our services via a hybrid fiber coaxial (“HFC”) cable network and via fiber GPON network in the Cayman Islands and Guyana. In Guyana, we also provide fixed services via DSL and FWA. These networks give us expanded Internet access coverage to an average of 95% of homes across our markets with speeds up to 500 Mbps for residential customers in most markets. Following Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 (collectively, the “Hurricanes”), service to our customers over the HFC network was impacted due to both the loss of power and damage to our network. We have completed remediation efforts to our network such as building tower structures to 160 MPH ratings and adding underground and alternate routes where ever possible.
​
Our international voice and data networks are linked with the rest of the world principally through our ownership and investments in six undersea fiber-optic cables in the Caribbean and Atlantic regions. These cables are crucial arteries that supply access to communications services for islands and remote markets like the ones in which we operate. For example, in Guyana we co-own with Telesur, the government-owned telecommunications provider in Suriname, the Suriname-Guyana Submarine Cable System that provides us with more robust redundancy, the capacity to meet growing data demands in Guyana, and the opportunity to provide new and enhanced services such as Internet service. In Bermuda, we own the Challenger Bermuda cable that provides us with capacity from Bermuda to the United States.
​
Sales and Marketing. Our businesses utilize four key sales channels: stores, telesales, business-to-business (“B2B”) channels and residential sales (inbound). Certain residential sales are made through inbound communications to customer service representatives who assist with a wide range of inquiries and sell different product offerings to help retain customers or improve their service with upgrades or bundles. Our revenues for our Fixed services are derived from installation charges for new lines, monthly line charges, data and video services and value added services, such as hosting or enterprise voice and data solutions. For our Fixed voice services, rates differ for residential and commercial customers and in certain markets, may be set by regulatory authorities.
​
Competition. We compete with a limited number of other providers, including Digicel, with respect to various products. We believe our breadth of services and local economies of scale provide us with a strong competitive position and the ability to win and retain an economically viable share of those markets.
​
In Guyana, we have an agreement with the Government of Guyana for the exclusive right to provide domestic fixed and international voice and data services. However, in October of 2020, the Government implemented new legislation to introduce legal competition into the sector.  We believe that our exclusive agreement continues to be valid unless and until such time as we enter into an alternative agreement with the Government. For further discussion regarding the change in competitive landscape following the 2020 Guyana election and new regulatory regime, see “—Guyana Regulation—Regulatory Developments” and “Risk Factors—Our operations in Guyana are subject to significant political and regulatory risk.”

US Telecom Segment 
​
Carrier & Mobility Services
​
Carrier Services. In the United States, we provide wholesale mobile voice and data roaming services in rural markets to national, regional, local and selected international wireless carriers as part of our Carrier Services as well as tower rental, backhaul and maintenance services. Our largest wholesale networks are located principally in the western United States. 
​
We currently have roaming agreements with approximately 32 United States-based wireless service providers and, as of December 31, 2020, had roaming arrangements with each of the three US national wireless network operators: Verizon Wireless, AT&T, and T-Mobile. Other than these agreements with the national carriers, our standard roaming agreements are usually terminable within 90 days. In 2020, the three national mobile service providers together accounted for a substantial portion of our Carrier Services revenues, with AT&T and Verizon accounting for an aggregate of approximately 15% of our total consolidated revenue for the year.
​
The revenue and profits of our Carrier Services business historically were primarily driven by the number of sites and base stations in operation, the amount of voice and data traffic that each of these sites generates, and the rates we receive from our carrier customers on that traffic. Many of our sites are located in popular tourist and seasonal visitor areas, which has historically resulted in higher wholesale revenues in those areas during the summer months.
​
We are increasingly providing network infrastructure services as part of our expanded Carrier Services, such as tower leasing and transport facilities to our carrier partners, to supplement our historic revenue base. In July 2019, we entered into a Network Build and Maintenance Agreement (the “FirstNet Agreement”) with AT&T to build a portion of AT&T’s network for the First Responder Network Authority (“FirstNet”) as well as a commercial wireless network in or near its current operating area in the Southwestern United States (the “FirstNet Transaction”). Pursuant to the FirstNet Agreement and subject to certain limitations contained therein, all cell sites must be completed and accepted within a specified period of time, which we jointly agreed to extend with AT&T in August 2020 due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and other permitting related delays. We began recording construction revenue in September 2020 and have recorded $10.9 million of construction revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect to record an additional $75 million through 2022 that will be mainly offset by construction costs as sites are completed. As such, revenues from construction are expected to have minimal impact on operating income. Also pursuant to the FirstNet Agreement AT&T has the option to repay construction costs, with interest, over and eight year period.  Accordingly, we entered into a receivables credit facility with CoBank, ACB (the “Receivables Credit Facility”) in order to assist with this repayment option.  The Receivables Credit Facility provides for a senior secured delayed draw term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $75 million with the proceeds being used to acquire the receivables related to the construction costs.
​
Following acceptance of a cell site, AT&T will own the cell site and we will assign to AT&T any third-party tower lease applicable to such cell site. If the cell site is located on a communications tower we own, AT&T will pay us pursuant to a separate lease agreement for an initial term of eight years. In addition to building the network, we will provide ongoing equipment and site maintenance and high capacity transport to and from these cell sites for an initial term ending in 2029.
​
AT&T will continue to use our wholesale domestic mobile network for roaming services at a fixed rate per site during the construction period until such time as the cell site is transferred to AT&T. Thereafter, revenue from the maintenance, leasing and transport services provided to AT&T is expected to offset revenue from AT&T’s decline in usage of wholesale mobile roaming services, albeit at lower operating income margins due to the increased operating expenses associated with leasing and transport services, as compared to our wholesale mobile roaming services. We began receiving roaming revenue from the FirstNet Transaction in the third quarter of 2019 and expect overall operating income contributions from the FirstNet Transaction to continue to have a relatively steady impact going forward.
​
Mobility Services. We also offer Mobility services to customers in certain rural markets already covered by our wholesale networks. In 2018, we invested in a new platform that provides comprehensive in-building cellular solutions 

7



to enable users and devices to roam across public carrier networks seamlessly and securely. Our private 5G/LTE mobile network offering interconnects seamlessly with major mobile operators, delivering a secure, robust and flexible network and services for private applications and high-performance coverage for tenants and visitors. 
​
Network and Operations. Our roaming network offers mobile communications service through a digital wireless voice and data network that utilizes multiple cellular mobile technologies including UMTS/HSPA, CDMA/EvDO and LTE that often will be deployed at a single cell site location in order to maximize revenue opportunities. We provide wireless communications network products and services with owned and leased cellular, PCS, BRS, EBS, AWS, and CBRS spectrum. Our networks comprise base stations and radio transceivers located on owned or leased towers and buildings, telecommunications switches and owned or leased transport facilities. We design and construct our network in a manner that will provide high-quality service to substantially all types of compatible wireless devices. Network reliability is carefully considered and redundancy is employed in many aspects of our network design.
​
Route diversity, redundant equipment, ring topologies and the use of emergency standby power are used to enhance network reliability and minimize service disruptions from any particular network element failure. We operate high-capacity, carrier-class digital wireless switching systems that are capable of serving multiple markets through a single mobile telephone switching office. Centralized equipment used for network and data management is located in high-availability facilities supported by multiple levels of power and network redundancy. Our systems are designed to incorporate Internet Protocol (IP) packet-based Ethernet technology, which allows for increased data capacity and a more efficient network. Interconnection between the mobile telephone switching office and the cell sites utilizes Ethernet technology over fiber or microwave links for virtually all of our 4G LTE sites.
​
As of December 31, 2020, we owned and operated a total of 1,044 domestic base stations on 453 owned and leased sites, a Network Operations Center (or “NOC”), and a switching center. We also maintained a presence in numerous leased data centers designed to support network virtualization and provide network resiliency. Our NOC provides dedicated, 24-hour, year-round monitoring of our network to ensure quality and reliable service to our customers. In 2020, we continued to expand and improve our network and plan to test and commercially deploy voLTE technology in 2021. voLTE technology allows customers to utilize a 4G LTE network for both voice and data services, and the migration of our wholesale and retail subscribers in the following years to the more efficient 4G technology from 2G/3G technologies will result in increased spectrum availability.
​
Competition. With respect to our Carrier Services, we compete with mobile service providers that operate networks in our markets and offer wholesale roaming services. However, the most significant competitive challenge we face in our US wholesale wireless business is the extent to which our carrier customers choose not to roam on our networks or elect to build or acquire their own infrastructure in a market in which we operate, reducing or eliminating their need for our services in those markets. We address this competitive threat mainly by providing a service that would be more costly for the carrier to provide itself, or, at least, a less attractive expenditure than alternative investments in its network or business. With respect to our Mobility services, we compete with other mobile service providers in our retail business and with a variety of providers of private network services.
​
Our ability to maintain appropriate capacity and relevant technology to respond to our roaming partners’ needs also shapes our competitive profile in the markets in which we operate. We believe that currently available technologies and appropriate capital additions will allow sufficient capacity on our networks to meet anticipated demand for voice and data services over the next few years. However, increasing retail demand for high-speed data may require the acquisition of additional spectrum licenses to provide sufficient capacity and throughput.
​
Fixed Services
​
Sales and Marketing. Our wholesale transport customers are predominately communications carriers such as local exchange carriers, wireless carriers, internet service providers and interstate integrated providers.
​
Competition. Our wholesale competitors include Zayo, other national fiber providers and regional wholesale providers and cable television companies that operate fiber-optic networks.
​

Renewable Energy Services
​
On April 7, 2016, we acquired Vibrant, and since that time, have constructed a total of 65 MWp of distributed generation solar power projects in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana based on a commercial and industrial business model, similar to our former US renewable energy operations. On January 27, 2021, we completed the Vibrant Transaction, and we continue to retain a 33% interest in Vibrant. In the Vibrant Transaction we received approximately $21 million at closing and the potential for up to $6.3 million of additional “earn out” consideration upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Vibrant Transaction is consistent with our strategy of seeking third party equity capital in order to build a larger portfolio and achieve economies of scale and diversification benefits. 
​
Services. Historically, our solar projects were in the “commercial and industrial” (“C&I”) sector of the solar market, which is distinguished from utilities and residential customers. Our customers or “offtakers” included high-credit quality corporate entities, utilities, schools, and municipalities, which purchased electricity from us under the terms of long-term power purchase agreements (“PPAs”). In India, we have also executed PPAs with offtakers utilizing a “group captive” construct whereby our offtakers own an equity interest in certain of our projects. This arrangement enables us to extend the term of a PPA for such projects up to twenty five years in duration at predictable and stable prices. As such, we believe the PPAs provide us with high-quality contracted cash flows, which, although our customers may terminate the PPAs with one-year notice, we nevertheless expect will continue over their average remaining life.
​
Infrastructure. Our existing facilities are located on land owned by Vibrant and are comprised of ground-mounted solar photovoltaic (“PV”) installations. We manage our facilities through third party operation and maintenance (“O&M”) contracts and our corporate staff tracks the data and services provided by the third-party service provider. We depend on a limited number of key suppliers for the PV modules that we purchase for installation at our facilities, with the majority of facilities constructed with Tier 1 PV modules supplied by GCL Systems, a Tier 1 Chinese module supplier.
​
ATN Ventures and Minority Investments
​
In addition to our core telecommunications operating companies, we have also made investments in earlier stage businesses, some of which are non-controlling investments whose technology-forward approach we consider strategically relevant and which, in addition to the potential for creating supplemental cash flow as they grow, can also provide a variety of benefits that enhance the potential to expand our more mature businesses. These benefits include providing entry points into emerging sectors of our existing businesses, enhancing our product offerings, providing visibility into newer technologies and establishing and enhancing strategic relationships. 
​
As a vehicle for our investments, in 2017 we formed ATN Ventures, our corporate venture capital arm that is an active, strategic investor with deep operational expertise seeking to partner with great entrepreneurs to build lasting value. Through ATN Ventures, we invest in services and technology companies that bring synergies to ATN’s operating businesses in the US and internationally.
​
To date, we have engaged in the below investments:

Human Capital
​
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,700 employees, of whom approximately 1,000 were employed by our international subsidiaries, and approximately 700 were employed in the United States (including in the US Virgin Islands). At the holding company level, we employ our executive management team and staff. Approximately half of our Guyana and US Virgin Islands full-time work forces are represented by unions. Approximately 20% of our Bermuda full-time workforce is represented by unions. 
​
We rely heavily on local management teams to run our subsidiary operating units.  Many of the markets in which we operate are small and remote, and in some cases are subject to government restrictions on granting work visas, all of which makes it difficult to attract and retain talented and qualified managers and staff in those markets.  We work hard to maintain positive and productive working environments and we believe we have good relations with our employees and management teams.  
​
It is our objective to maintain a respectful and diverse corporate culture.  Our culture is driven by our core values, including a demonstrated commitment to inclusion and diversity. Across our core businesses in all our markets, approximately 30% of senior management and an additional 40% of middle management identify as persons of color, including Afro-Caribbean, Latinx, Indo-Caribbean and other races or ethnicities and approximately 15% of senior management and an additional 40% of middle management are women. We are also committed to the principal of equal pay for equal work.

Our wireless and wireline communications and video services operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide services. Our operations in the United States and the US Virgin Islands are governed by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”), the implementing regulations adopted thereunder by the FCC, including the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as well as judicial and regulatory decisions interpreting and implementing the Communications Act, and other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Our operations are also governed by certain foreign laws and regulations.
The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation does not purport to describe all present and proposed federal, state, local, and foreign regulation and legislation that may affect our businesses. Legislative or regulatory requirements currently applicable to our businesses may change in the future and legislative or regulatory requirements may be adopted by those jurisdictions that currently have none. Any such changes could impose new obligations on us that could adversely affect our operating results.

US Federal Regulation
​
Wireless Services
​
The FCC regulates, among other things, the licensed and unlicensed use of radio spectrum; the ownership, lease, transfer of control and assignment of wireless licenses; the ongoing technical, operational and service requirements applicable to such licenses; the timing, nature and scope of network construction; the provision of certain services, such as enhanced 911 (“E 911”); and the interconnection of communications networks in the United States.


Licenses. We provide our wireless services pursuant to various commercial mobile radio services (“CMRS”) licenses, including cellular, broadband Personal Communications Services (“PCS”), 600 MHz Band, 700 MHz Band, Advanced Wireless Service (“AWS”), Broadband Radio Service (“BRS”) and Educational Broadband Service (“EBS”) licenses granted by the FCC, and pursuant to leases of licenses from FCC licensed operators. Some of these licenses are site based while others cover specified geographic market areas, e.g., Cellular Market Areas, Basic Trading Areas, and Partial Economic Areas, as defined by the FCC. The specific radio frequencies, the authorized spectrum amounts, and certain of the technical and service rules vary depending on the licensed service. The FCC generally allocates CMRS 

10



licenses through periodic auctions, after determining how many licenses to make available in particular frequency ranges, the applicable service rules, and the terms on which the license auction will be conducted. Such licenses are also available via secondary market mechanisms, using procedures and regulations set forth by the FCC. The FCC recently conducted auctions of high-band and mid-band spectrum, and is considering holding a further mid-band spectrum auction in 2021. In the FCC’s 2020 auction of Citizens Broadband Radio Service (“CBRS”) Priority Access Licenses (“PAL”) in the 3.5 GHz band, we won licenses in 590 U.S. counties, and expect these licenses to be issued in 2021. There is no certainty as to whether any of these licenses will be used for wireless services competitive with our services or as to the likelihood that we will acquire spectrum licenses made available in any future auction.
​
Construction Obligations. The FCC conditions licenses on the satisfaction of certain obligations to construct networks covering a specified geographic area or population by specific dates. The obligations vary depending on the licensed service. Failure to satisfy an applicable construction requirement can result in the assessment of fines and forfeitures by the FCC, a reduced license term, or automatic license cancellation. We are substantially in compliance with the applicable construction requirements that have arisen for the licenses we currently hold and expect to meet our future construction requirements as well. 
​
License Renewals. Our FCC licenses generally expire between 2021 and 2030 and are renewable upon application to the FCC. License renewal applications may be denied if the FCC determines, after appropriate notice and hearing, that renewal would not serve the public interest, convenience, or necessity. At the time of renewal, we must demonstrate that we have maintained operations (and service in some instances) at or above levels needed to satisfy our construction requirements, that we have not permanently discontinued operations at any time during our prior license term, and that we have substantially complied with the rules and regulations of the FCC and the Communications Act. If we are able to make these certifications, we may claim a license renewal safe harbor. If we cannot make these certifications, we must instead file a license renewal showing how we have used our license during our prior license term, which the FCC has broad discretion to approve or deny. If a renewal showing is denied, our license renewal application will be dismissed, and our license will not be renewed for an additional license term. While our licenses have been renewed regularly by the FCC in the past, there can be no assurance that all of our licenses will be renewed in the future.
​
The FCC may deny license applications and, in extreme cases, revoke licenses if it finds that an entity lacks the requisite qualifications to be a licensee. In making that determination, the FCC considers whether an applicant or licensee has been the subject of adverse findings in a judicial or administrative proceeding involving felonies, the possession or sale of unlawful drugs, fraud, antitrust violations, or unfair competition, employment discrimination, misrepresentations to the FCC or other government agencies, or serious violations of the Communications Act or FCC regulations. To our knowledge, there are no activities and no judicial or administrative proceedings involving either us or the licensees in which we hold a controlling interest that would warrant such a finding by the FCC.
​
License Acquisitions. Prior FCC approval typically is required for transfers or assignments of a controlling interest in any license or construction permit, or of any rights thereunder. The FCC may approve or prohibit such transactions altogether, or approve such transactions subject to certain conditions such as divestitures or other requirements. Non-controlling minority interests in an entity that holds an FCC license generally may be bought or sold without FCC approval, subject to any applicable FCC notification requirements. The FCC permits licensees to lease spectrum to third parties under certain conditions, subject to prior FCC approval, or in some instances, notification to the FCC. These mechanisms provide additional flexibility for wireless providers to structure transactions and create additional business and investment opportunities.
​
The FCC no longer caps the amount of CMRS spectrum in which an entity may hold an attributable interest and now instead engages in a case-by-case review of proposed wireless transactions, including spectrum acquired via auction, to ensure that the proposed transaction serves the public interest and would not result in a rule violation or an undue concentration of market power. The FCC utilizes a spectrum aggregation “screen” to determine whether a proposed secondary market transaction requires additional scrutiny. Under this approach, a transaction will be reviewed by the FCC for potential competitive effects if it will result in the acquiring entity having (1) total spectrum holdings generally exceeding approximately one-third of the total amount of suitable and available spectrum in any county (which the FCC raised in 2020 from 240 MHz to 250 MHz) or (2) over 68 MHz of spectrum under 1 GHz. The FCC’s 

11



additional scrutiny would also be triggered if a proposed transaction results in a material change in the post transaction market share in a particular market as measured by the Herfindahl Hirschman Index. We are well below the spectrum aggregation screen in the majority of geographic areas in which we hold or have access to licenses, and thus we may be able to acquire additional spectrum either from the FCC in an auction or from third parties in private transactions in most locations in which we operate. However, we could trigger the spectrum screen if we attempt to acquire significant additional spectrum in the US Virgin Islands. Similarly, our competitors may be able to strengthen their operations by making additional acquisitions of spectrum in our markets or by further consolidating the industry.
​
Other Requirements. The Communications Act and the FCC’s rules impose a number of additional requirements upon wireless service providers. A failure to meet or maintain compliance with the Communications Act and/or the FCC’s rules may subject us to fines, forfeitures, penalties or other sanctions.
​
Wireless licensees must satisfy a variety of FCC requirements relating to technical and reporting matters. Licensees must often coordinate frequency usage with adjacent licensees and permittees to avoid interference between adjacent systems. In addition, the height and power of transmitting facilities and the type of signals emitted must fall within specified parameters. For certain licensed services, a variety of incumbent government and non-government operations may have to be relocated before a licensee may commence operations, which may trigger the incurrence of relocation costs by the incoming licensee.
​
The radio systems towers that we own and lease are subject to Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations that govern the location, marking, lighting and construction of towers and are subject to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and other environmental statutes enforced by the FCC. The FCC has also adopted guidelines and methods for evaluating human exposure to radiofrequency field emissions from radio equipment. We believe that all of our radio systems on towers that we own or lease comply in all material respects with these requirements, guidelines and methods.
​
The FCC has adopted requirements for cellular, PCS and other CMRS providers to implement basic 911 and E- 911 services. These services provide state and local emergency service providers with the ability to better identify and locate 911 callers using wireless services, including callers using special devices for the hearing impaired. Because the implementation of these obligations requires that the local emergency services provider have certain facilities available, our specific obligations are set on a market-by-market basis as emergency service providers request the implementation of E-911 services within their locales. As part of an E-911 initiative, the FCC adopted stronger rules regarding E-911 location accuracy and continues to evaluate the potential for improving location accuracy for 911 calls. The extent to which we are required to deploy E-911 services will affect our capital spending obligations. Federal law limits our liability for uncompleted 911 calls to a degree commensurate with wireline carriers in our markets.
​
The FCC also has adopted rules requiring wireless carriers and certain other text messaging service providers to provide text-to-911 service and an automatic “bounce back” text message to consumers who try to text 911 where text to 911 is not available, indicating the unavailability of such services. Like E-911 services, the obligation to provide these services is largely tied to requests from emergency service providers for these services. We are currently in compliance with all public safety answering point requests we have received. The FCC has also sought further comment regarding additional regulations pertaining to the provision of text to 911 service.
​
In addition to CMRS licenses, our wireless business relies on FCC-licensed spectrum for “Common Carrier Fixed Point to Point Microwave,” referred to as common carrier microwave. We currently operate over 250 licensed microwave links. Common carrier microwave stations are generally used in a point-to-point configuration for cellular site backhaul connections or to connect points on the telephone network that cannot be connected using standard wireline or fiber optic cable because of cost or terrain. The majority of our license grants are for a period of 10 years. The FCC grants license renewal applications in the ordinary course.
​
The FCC established a Wireless Emergency Alerts system that allows CMRS providers to transmit emergency alerts to the public. This system is voluntary. We have partially opted in to the service and are currently providing it to all of our retail wireless customers to the extent required by applicable regulations and where technically feasible. The rules governing participation contain many requirements, such as point of sale disclosures, geo-targeting alerts, alert logging, 

12



maximum message lengths, alert preservation, alerts regarding threats to police officers, and support for non- English messages.
​
In 2019, the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act (“TRACED Act”) was signed into law requiring all IP-based voice service providers to implement, by July 2021, the secure telephone identity revisited and signature-based handling of asserted information using tokens (“STIR/SHAKEN”) call authentication standards or take reasonable measures to implement an effective call authentication framework in their non-IP networks or in networks operated by carriers with fewer than 100,000 customers. During 2020, the FCC adopted several Orders to implement the provisions of the TRACED Act.  The Company is taking the steps necessary to comply with the new requirements.
​
The FCC’s rules require CMRS providers to offer “roaming” services to other providers. Roaming enables one provider’s customers to obtain service from another provider when the customer is using their wireless device in an area served by the second provider. These rules apply to voice, messaging, and data services, including Internet access, although the roaming rules vary somewhat among these services. We are obligated to offer roaming, and we have the right to seek roaming from other providers, on reasonable terms and conditions. The FCC has identified a variety of factors that are relevant to whether an offer to provide roaming is reasonable, including the price, terms and conditions, and whether the two providers’ networks are technologically compatible. Changes in the FCC’s roaming regulations may affect the terms under which we provide roaming services to third parties and may affect our ability to secure roaming arrangements with other CMRS providers on behalf of our retail wireless customers.
​
We are obligated to pay certain annual regulatory fees and assessments to support FCC wireless industry regulation, as well as fees supporting federal universal service programs, number portability, regional database costs, centralized telephone numbering administration, telecommunications relay service for the hearing impaired and application filing fees. These fees are subject to change periodically by the FCC and the manner in which carriers may recoup these fees from customers is subject to various restrictions.
​
Wireline Services
​
The Communications Act encourages competition in local telecommunications markets by removing barriers to market entry and imposing on non-rural incumbent local exchange carriers (“ILECs”) various requirements related to, among other things, interconnection, access to unbundled network elements, co-location, access to poles, ducts, conduits, and rights of way, wholesale and resale obligations, and telephone number portability. Our ILEC operations in the US Virgin Islands through Viya are exempt from most such federal requirements pursuant to a rural exemption.
​
While, to date, the FCC has declined to classify interconnected voice-over Internet protocol (“VoIP”) service as a telecommunications service or information service, it has imposed a number of consumer protection and public safety obligations on interconnected VoIP providers, relying in large part on its general ancillary jurisdiction powers. To the extent that we provide interconnected VoIP service, we are subject to a number of these obligations.
​
In recent years, the FCC has taken actions to help expedite the deployment of wireline (and wireless) network infrastructure. Those actions include adopting rules to facilitate the attachment of new facilities to utility poles and eliminating or reducing requirements to provide notice of service discontinuance. We expect these FCC actions will facilitate our ability to expand our wireline network coverage. 
​
Video Services
​
Video services systems are regulated by the FCC under the Communications Act. The FCC regulates our programming selection through local broadcast TV station mandatory carriage obligations, constraints on our retransmission consent negotiations with local broadcast TV stations, and limited regulation of our carriage negotiations with cable programming networks. The FCC and federal laws also impose rules governing, among other things, leased cable set-top boxes, our ability to collect and disclose subscribers’ personally identifiable information, access to inside wiring in multiple dwelling units, cable pole attachments, customer service and technical standards, and disability access requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to penalties. The FCC is examining whether it should modernize its video regulations and already has updated or eliminated some requirements, but we cannot predict whether and to what extent the FCC will continue to pursue deregulation in this space.

Wireless and Wireline Services
​
Universal Service. In general, all telecommunications providers are obligated to contribute to the USF, which is used to promote the availability of qualifying telecommunications and broadband service to individuals and families qualifying for federal assistance, households located in rural and high cost areas and to schools, libraries, and rural health care providers. Contributions to the federal USF are based on end-user interstate and international telecommunications revenue. Some states have similar programs that also require contribution. The FCC has suggested that it may examine the way in which it collects carrier contributions to the USF, including a proposal to base collections on the number of telephone numbers or network connections in use by each carrier, and some states have changed or are considering changing their contribution methodologies. We contribute to the USF as required by the rules throughout the US, and receive funds from the USF for providing service in rural areas of the United States, including the US Virgin Islands.
​
The collection of USF fees and distribution of USF support is under continual review by state and federal legislative and regulatory bodies, and changes to these programs could affect our revenues. We are subject to audit by the Universal Service Administration Company with respect to our contributions and our receipts of universal service funding. We believe we are substantially compliant with all FCC and state regulations related to the receipt and collection of universal service support.
​
In November 2011, the FCC released an order reforming the USF program for high-cost areas in the continental U.S. As part of the USF reforms, the FCC created a new program, the Connect America Fund.
​
In August 2018, we were awarded $79.9 million over 10 years under a portion of the Connect America Fund program called the Connect America Fund Phase II Auction. The funding requires us to provide Fixed broadband and voice services to certain eligible areas in the United States. We are subject to operational and reporting requirements under the program. Funding began in the second quarter of 2019 and we record the amounts received as revenue in our financial statements. In the 2020 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Phase I Auction, pending the FCC’s conclusion of the award process, we expect to receive approximately $20.1 million over 10 years to provide broadband coverage to over 10,000 households. Once confirmed, we will be obligated to provide broadband and voice services to certain eligible areas in the United States.
​
Our business in the US Virgin Islands also benefits from USF support. Our US Virgin Islands wireline business has historically received, and continues to receive, annual support of approximately $16.4 million. In addition, after the devastation caused by the Hurricanes in September 2017, the FCC provided approximately $9.7 million in recovery support in November 2017, and an additional $7.3 million in recovery support in August 2018. In 2018, the FCC initiated a proceeding to reform the USF program for high cost in the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in which it proposed to allocate USF funding of up to $18.7 million per year (inclusive of the $16.4 million per year currently allocated to Viya) for 10 years to support fixed voice and broadband services in the US Virgin Islands through a new Connect USVI Fund. 
​
In September 2019, the FCC adopted an order in this proceeding establishing a new competitive proposal process for awarding the Connect USVI Fund support that will supplant the $16.4 million that Viya currently receives per year. While Viya applied for Connect USVI Fund support allocated for the US Virgin Islands, on November 16, 2020, the FCC announced that Viya was not the recipient of the provisional award and that the FCC had provisionally accepted a bid of approximately $8.6 million per year for a term of 10 years. Viya has challenged this decision and its challenge remains pending before the FCC. If Viya’s challenge is not granted, pursuant to the terms of the program, Viya’s USF support will be reduced, to 2/3 of the legacy total amount, or $10.9 million during the first year following the finalization of the award and to 1/3 of the legacy total amount, or $5.5 million, during the second year. Thereafter, Viya will not receive high-cost USF support. 
​
Intercarrier Compensation. Under federal and state law, telecommunications providers are sometimes required to compensate one another for originating and terminating traffic for other carriers. Consistent with these provisions, we currently receive compensation from other carriers and also pay compensation to other carriers. In October 2011, the FCC significantly revised its intercarrier compensation regime such that most of these compensation obligations ceased 

14



by July 1, 2017, and most remaining obligations ceased on July 1, 2020. As a result, this type of intercarrier compensation is no longer material to our business.
​
Net Neutrality. In January 2018, the FCC released a decision rescinding various “net neutrality” requirements, which had governed how broadband Internet access providers were permitted to offer broadband service. This decision largely eliminated the FCC’s regulation of our ability to block, throttle, or prioritize specific types of Internet traffic, and put a revised transparency-centered regulatory regime in place. Under the 2018 decision’s approach, broadband Internet access providers still must publicly disclose detailed information regarding their service offerings, Internet traffic management processes, and other practices affecting broadband customers. The FCC also held that states are preempted from enacting their own versions of these or similar requirements. A federal appeals court upheld most of the FCC’s 2018 decision, but it reversed the FCC’s blanket preemption of state broadband rules. The court also (1) held that state broadband laws only may be preempted on a case-by-case basis when they conflict with state or federal policy, and (2) remanded certain issues to the FCC. The court subsequently declined to rehear the case, and no party sought review by the U.S. Supreme Court. In October 2020, the FCC affirmed its 2018 decision after addressing the issues remanded by the court. Meanwhile, a number of states have adopted – or are considering – state-level net neutrality requirements. These efforts include enacted legislation and executive orders dating back to 2018. Some state efforts are currently subject to legal challenge by broadband providers and/or the United States government in federal district court. These legal challenges were paused during the appellate proceedings on the FCC’s 2018 decision, but have now resumed. We cannot predict with any certainty the likely timing or outcome of these or future challenges, or how state or federal efforts to adopt net neutrality requirements will continue to evolve.
​
Telecommunications Privacy Regulations. We are subject to federal regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business. Certain federal statutory and regulatory privacy and data security requirements apply to our telecommunications and cable services. Other parts of our business are subject to privacy and data security oversight by other federal regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission. In addition, federal and state regulators have adopted or are considering adopting new privacy laws. For instance, the state of California has enacted two broad new privacy statutes, the first effective January 1, 2020, and the second effective January 1, 2023 although we do not believe that they are applicable to our business. Such state privacy regulations could impact at least some of our operations. In addition, the US Congress is actively discussing establishing a new privacy regime that would impose a uniform privacy framework across the United States and its territories. We believe that we comply with all currently applicable requirements, but we cannot predict the timeline for any future changes of law in this area or the impact of any such changes on our businesses.
​
CALEA. Under certain circumstances, federal law also requires telecommunications carriers to provide law enforcement agencies with capacity and technical capabilities to support lawful wiretaps pursuant to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (“CALEA”). Federal law also requires compliance with wiretap related record keeping and personnel related obligations. The FCC has adopted rules that apply CALEA obligations to high-speed Internet access and VoIP services. We believe that we are in compliance with all such requirements currently applicable to us. Maintaining compliance with these law enforcement requirements may impose additional capital spending obligations on us to make necessary system upgrades.
​
Obligations Due to Economic Stimulus Grants. One of our subsidiaries has received awards from the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (“BTOP”) of the US Department of Commerce (“DOC”) pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”). As a BTOP sub-recipient, we are subject to the various terms and conditions included in the agency’s Notice of Funds Availability published in the Federal Register on July 9, 2009. We are also required to comply with other terms and conditions of the individual DOC grants. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with all BTOP and DOC requirements applicable to our grants.
​
US State Regulation
​
Wireless Services
​
Federal law generally preempts state and local regulation of the entry of, or the rates charged by, any CMRS provider. For this reason, as a practical matter, we are generally free to establish wireless rates and offer new wireless 

15



products and services, and our wireless businesses are subject to minimal state regulatory requirements. However, the states in which we operate maintain nominal oversight jurisdiction. For example, states may regulate the “terms and conditions” of a CMRS provider’s service other than rates. States and localities also assess taxes and fees on wireless carriers.
​
The location and construction of our wireless transmission towers and antennas are subject to state and local environmental regulation, as well as state or local zoning, land use and other regulation. Before we can put a system into commercial operation or expand a system, we must obtain all necessary zoning and building permit approvals for the cell site and tower locations. The time needed to obtain zoning approvals and requisite permits varies from market to market and state to state. Likewise, variations exist in local zoning processes. If zoning approval or requisite state permits cannot be obtained, or if environmental rules make construction impossible or infeasible on a particular site, our network design might be adversely affected, network design costs could increase and the service provided to our customers might be limited.
​
In recent years, the FCC has taken actions to help expedite the deployment of wireless network infrastructure. Those actions include limiting state and local regulations governing the construction or modification of towers and the installation of small cells and other facilities within and outside public rights-of-way when the FCC determines those regulations can be barriers to deployment. Among other things, the FCC established new shorter shot clocks for completion of local reviews of small wireless facility applications, and required that fees which states and localities may charge for the location of small cells in rights-of-way must be cost-based. Several of the FCC’s most recent decisions were challenged in court by individual localities and organizations representing local governments. While some of the FCC’s actions have been upheld, others have been vacated or remanded, and others remain subject to petitions for reconsideration or appeal. We cannot predict with certainty the likely timing or outcome of these challenges. 
​
US Virgin Islands Regulation
​
Virgin Islands Public Service Commission
​
In addition to the regulations described above, our operations in the US Virgin Islands are also subject to the US Virgin Islands Public Utilities Code, pursuant to which the Virgin Islands Public Service Commission (“PSC”) regulates certain telecommunications and cable TV services that Viya provides in the US Virgin Islands. Among other things, the PSC establishes the rates and fees that we may charge local exchange residential and enterprise customers in the US Virgin Islands for certain wireline telecommunications services. The PSC is required by US Virgin Islands law to review local utility rates every five years. In June 2016, the PSC adopted an order increasing the rates and fees that we may charge subject to certain conditions and future obligations and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a transfer of control agreement with the PSC on July 1, 2016, which imposes certain operational and reporting obligations on the Viya companies. We believe that we have satisfied these requirements. Further, as a condition to Viya’s receipt of USF funds from the FCC, the PSC is required to certify on an annual basis that Viya is in compliance with certain eligible telecommunication carrier (“ETC”) obligations. We believe that we comply with all such obligations but cannot predict the outcome of future PSC proceedings relating to Viya’s ETC status.
​
Our subsidiaries provide cable TV service in the US Virgin Islands pursuant to two franchises granted by the PSC. Each franchise was renewed in July 2015 by an order issued by the PSC, but the PSC has not yet issued new franchise agreements memorializing these renewals. We cannot predict what requirements will be included in the renewed franchise agreements. However, we understand that the renewed franchise agreements will likely contain substantially similar terms and conditions as the prior franchise agreements, including a 15-year term. We also believe that the renewed franchise agreements will exclude prior language permitting the PSC to regulate our cable rates. In August 2019, the FCC issued a decision placing some limits on the powers of local cable franchising authorities such as the PSC, including limits on their ability to impose franchise fees and to regulate non-cable services. A number of local franchising authorities have challenged that decision in federal appeals court. We cannot predict the outcome of that appeal, or how the FCC’s actions will impact our business.

Virgin Islands Research and Technology Park
​
Our video, internet and wireless companies in the US Virgin Islands also receive tax benefits as qualifying participants in the US Virgin Islands’ Research & Technology Park (“RTPark”) program. RTPark was chartered with the goal of promoting technology-based economic development in the territory and offering attractive economic incentives to companies that contribute to the development of the Virgin Islands through local employment and sourcing, as well as significant contributions to both the economy and the non-profit sectors of the community. As part of the program, our participating entities currently receive a 100% tax exemption applied against gross receipts, property, and excise taxes as well as a 90% exemption against income taxes and a reduction in customs duties from 6% to 1%. These benefits resulted in tax exemptions of approximately $1.9 million and $1.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
​
In order to qualify, we are required to maintain certain capital investments over the first five years of the agreement, pay monthly management fees of 0.4% of tenant company revenue, make annual charitable contributions to the University of the Virgin Islands, purchase products and services locally when feasible and provide in-kind services to RTPark.

​
Guyana Regulation
​
Our subsidiary, Guyana Telephone & Telegraph Limited (“GTT”), in which we hold an 80% interest, is subject to regulation in Guyana under the provisions of GTT’s License from the Government of Guyana, the Guyana Public Utilities Commission Act of 2016 as amended (or “PUC Law”) and the Guyana Telecommunications Act of 2016 (or “Telecommunications Law”). The Ministry of Telecommunications, an agency of the Government of Guyana, has formal authority over telecommunications licensing and related issues. The Public Utilities Commission of Guyana (or “PUC”) is an independent statutory body with the principal responsibility for regulating telecommunications rates and services in Guyana. The Telecommunications Agency (or “TA”) advises and makes recommendations to the Minister of Telecommunications, implements policy and has principal responsibility for operating licenses and frequency authorizations.
​
Licenses. GTT provides domestic Fixed (both wireline and wireless) and international voice and data services in Guyana pursuant to licenses from the Government of Guyana granting GTT the right to provide a variety of domestic Fixed services (both wireline and wireless) and international voice and data services. These licenses were issued in October 2020. Pursuant to the licenses, GTT also provides mobile wireless telephone service in Guyana.
​
PUC Law and Telecommunications Law. The PUC Law and the Telecommunications Law, and related regulations adopted in October 2020, provide the general framework for the regulation of telecommunications services in Guyana. As a general matter, the PUC has authority to regulate GTT’s domestic and international telecommunications services and rates and to require GTT to supply certain technical, administrative and financial information as it may request. The PUC claims broad authority to review and amend any of GTT’s programs for development and expansion of facilities or services, although GTT has challenged the PUC’s view on the scope of its authority. For a description of recent actions of the PUC, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.
​
Regulatory Developments. On October 5, 2020, the Prime Minister of Guyana formally implemented telecommunications legislation previously passed by the Guyana Parliament in 2016 that introduces material changes to many features of Guyana’s existing telecommunications regulatory regime with the stated intention of creating a more competitive market. At that time, we were issued a new license to provide domestic and international voice as well as data services and mobile services in Guyana. Two of our competitors, who had previously provided fixed voice and internet services on an unlicensed basis, were issued service licenses as well. While we have requested details of our competitors’ licenses, such information has not been made public by the Guyana Telecommunications Agency, and we are not yet able to ascertain whether the licenses issued to our competitors permit any competitors to provide services that have been subject to GTT’s exclusive rights contained in its 1990 license. 
​
On October 23, 2020, the Government of Guyana also brought into effect new telecommunications regulations called for by the telecommunications legislation. The regulations include new requirements for the market as a whole, 

17



which impact our operations, administrative reporting and services. There can be no assurance that these regulations will be effectively implemented, or that they will be administered in a fair and transparent manner.
​
FCC Rule-Making and International Long-Distance Rates. The actions of foreign telecommunications regulators, especially the FCC in the United States, can affect the settlement or termination rate payable by foreign carriers to GTT for incoming international voice calls. While the FCC continues to monitor and evaluate termination rate levels and benchmarks, we cannot predict when and if the FCC will further reduce settlement rates or the effect lower rates will have on revenue in our International Telecom segment.
​
Bermuda Regulation
​
The Regulatory Authority of Bermuda (the “RA”) is the primary regulator of our operations in Bermuda.  The relevant legislation is the Regulatory Authority Act 2011 and the Electronic Communications Act 2011.  Pursuant to these statutes, the RA is responsible for regulating all electronic communications services in Bermuda, including the broadband, mobile and video services we offer.  The statutory framework provides the RA powers in respect of licensing, consumer protections, ex post competition issues, and the identification and remedying of significant market power concerns.
​
On September 1, 2020, the RA completed its second market review and affirmed its determination that we have significant market power in certain broadband and mobile services.  As a consequence, we are subject to, and have initiated a legal challenge of, a series of ex ante remedies that include wholesale obligations, price caps, accounting separation and reporting obligations in addition to the ex post competition rules that generally apply.  The ex-ante remedies are burdensome and, if implemented, will require financial, operational, legal and regulatory resources be allocated to ensure compliance.
​
