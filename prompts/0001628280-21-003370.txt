ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, that offer a clinically meaningful benefit for cancer patients with significant unmet need. We have leveraged over 20 years of industry learning in the ADC field to develop proprietary and differentiated technology platforms that enable us to design ADCs that have improved efficacy, safety and tolerability relative to existing ADC therapies.
Our innovative platforms, which include Dolaflexin and Dolasynthen, delivering our DolaLock payload, as well as Immunosynthen, delivering a novel stimulator of interferon genes, or STING, agonist, compose a highly efficient product engine that has enabled a robust discovery pipeline for us and our partners. Our ADCs in preclinical and clinical studies include 
first-in-class molecules that target multiple tumor types with high unmet medical need and have exhibited improved safety and efficacy compared to ADCs developed using first-generation technology.
We have assembled a management team with extensive and relevant experience, including specific ADC experience, from prior work at leading pharmaceutical companies such as Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Biogen, Inc., Bayer AG, Tesaro, Inc., Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Bristol Myers Squibb. We are supported by our board of directors and scientific advisory board, who offer complementary experience in drug discovery and development, as well as expertise in building public companies, management and business development. We believe that our highly differentiated platforms, together with the team we have assembled, position us well to discover and develop life-changing antibody-drug conjugates for patients fighting cancer.
Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading oncology company by leveraging the potential of our innovative and differentiated ADC technologies and the experience and competencies of our management team to discover and develop promising ADC product candidates and to commercialize cancer therapeutics that address unmet medical needs or provide significant benefit to patients. Key components of our strategy to achieve this goal are as follows:
•Rapidly advance upifitamab rilsodotin (UpRi, XMT-1536).  Our lead product candidate, UpRi, is a first-in-class Dolaflexin ADC currently in a Phase 1 proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with tumors likely to express NaPi2b, an antigen broadly expressed in ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, adenocarcinoma. We expect to initiate a single-arm registration strategy in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, UPLIFT, and a combination dose escalation study, UPGRADE, in earlier lines of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in 2021. 
•Rapidly advance XMT-1592 through dose escalation.  Mersana’s second product candidate targeting NaPi2b-expressing tumors, XMT-1592, is an ADC created using our Dolasynthen platform. In the first half of 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 dose escalation study of XMT-1592 in ovarian cancer and NSCLC adenocarcinoma. We believe that we have a path to advance XMT-1592 through rapid dose escalation and clinical validation.
•Expand our ADC pipeline.  We intend to establish a leading position in the field of ADCs by continuing to advance platform innovations that further broaden the potential of our ADCs to deliver clinically meaningful benefit for cancer patients, by focusing on first-in-class targets and payloads, and by pursuing fast-to-market opportunities. We are advancing a new, potentially first-in-class ADC targeting B7-H4, XMT-1660, which leverages our Dolasynthen platform in IND-enabling studies. We have taken ADCs beyond cytotoxics by developing the Immunosynthen platform, an approach that may allow tumor-targeted activation of the innate immune system. Our first Immunosynthen STING-agonist ADC development candidate, XMT-2056, is in IND-enabling studies.
•Attract and retain talented and experienced people. In addition to our team’s deep experience with ADC science, drug development and operational management, we believe that our accomplishments are a testament to the talent and commitment of our people. Our team is driven by a shared passion to advance therapies that make a significant difference in the lives of cancer patients. We will continue to cultivate the collaborative and passionate workplace culture that has allowed us to advance this mission.
•Build strategic partnerships to maximize the value of our programs and platforms.  Our platform technologies, and product discovery and development capabilities, drive the potential for multiple clinically meaningful opportunities for cancer patients. In order to preserve a disciplined drug development and commercialization focus, we may choose to enter into strategic partnerships that facilitate our ability to bring differentiated product candidates to more patients. Our current partnerships with Merck KGaA and Asana Biosciences exemplify different aspects of this strategy.
Our current pipeline is summarized in the chart below:
ADC Background
Traditional ADCs are a class of cancer biotherapeutics that combine the targeting capabilities of monoclonal antibodies with the cancer-killing ability of cytotoxic drug payloads. Antibodies and payloads are chemically linked, allowing specific drug delivery to cancer cells targeted by the antibody. After ADCs enter a cell, the conjugated payload is released and kills the cell. Despite the promise of ADCs, companies in the field have faced certain challenges in developing product candidates that achieve the optimal therapeutic index, or the balance between efficacy and tolerability. These challenges are characterized as follows:
•Linker stability:  Linkers must be stable in the bloodstream to ensure that free payload is not released into circulation prior to delivery into the tumor. Free payload in circulation causes toxicity. Efforts to design better linkers to increase stability have, in turn, reduced the efficiency of payload release once the ADC is internalized in the tumor cell, resulting in decreased efficacy.
•Drug-to-antibody ratio:  Increasing the number of payload molecules delivered per antibody internalization event increases potency. However, the drug-to-antibody ratio, or DAR, has typically been limited to three to four payload molecules per antibody due to aggregation, poor pharmacokinetics and loss of drug-like properties of the ADC at levels above this threshold. Other attempts to increase efficacy have involved the introduction of ultra-potent payloads, however these efforts appear to face safety and tolerability challenges, necessitating even further reduced DAR to maintain acceptable pharmacokinetics and drug-like properties.
•Target antigen expression level:  Tumor cells typically require a threshold number of payload molecules to be internalized in order to kill the cell. Antigens with lower levels of expression have proven less desirable as targets for ADCs, as a result of fewer binding, internalization and payload delivery events to drive cell-killing activity. In turn, this has limited the number of cancers amenable to treatment with low-DAR ADC approaches, as the use of ADCs requires antigen targets to be highly expressed on tumor cells.
•Bystander effect:  Once ADCs release their cytotoxic payload into targeted cells, the drug is often able to cross cell membranes, entering and potentially killing neighboring cells whether those cells are cancerous or not. This is known as the ‘bystander effect,’ which is advantageous when bystander cells are cancerous, but toxic if the cytotoxic drug is able to enter adjacent healthy cells, leading to dose-limiting toxicities such as neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, or ocular toxicity.
Our Technologies and Platforms
The development of ADCs is not a one-size-fits-all approach. In fact, a number of diverse factors impact the properties of an ADC, including payload, drug-to-antibody ratio, site of conjugation and homogeneity. For each target antigen, there is an optimal combination of these factors. Our novel and highly differentiated platforms are designed to allow us to optimize these properties for a given target and develop ADCs that best address patient needs.
DolaLock Payload
Our DolaLock payload is a proprietary auristatin cytotoxic drug and is a highly potent anti-tubulin agent selectively toxic to rapidly dividing cells. The DolaLock payload has been shown in preclinical studies to control the bystander effect by locking the cytotoxic drug inside cells after allowing a short period of diffusion throughout the tumor. As the drug diffuses through neighboring tissue, the DolaLock payload is metabolized to a form that is still highly potent but is no longer able to cross the cell membrane, effectively locking the drug inside cells and controlling the bystander effect for a safer and more effective cancer therapy.
A common mechanism of resistance in cancer is the up-regulation of multi-drug resistance, or MDR, pumps, such as P-glycoproteins, or PgPs, which actively pump drugs out of cancer cells to help them survive. Once metabolized, our DolaLock payload cannot be pumped out by PgPs, thereby avoiding this resistance mechanism. In addition, our proprietary auristatin payload has also been shown in preclinical studies to cause immunogenic cell death and to stimulate the immune system through dendritic cell activation. Because of this, synergy with immuno-oncology agents such as PD-1 inhibitors has been observed in preclinical models. Our DolaLock payload with controlled bystander effect is designed to allow us to create ADCs that produce a highly potent, well-tolerated and specifically-targeted cancer therapy.
Figure 1. DolaLock Payload with Controlled Bystander Effect
Dolaflexin Platform
The Dolaflexin platform was designed to increase the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ADCs. Dolaflexin utilizes our proprietary Fleximer polymer, a biodegradable, highly biocompatible, water-soluble polymer able to carry multiple drug molecules. Instead of direct conjugation to an antibody, drug molecules are attached through an optimized, cleavable linker to the Fleximer scaffold, which is then conjugated to the antibody through a non-cleavable linker. Fleximer has demonstrated dramatically improved drug solubility, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity, and an increased number of drug molecules carried by each ADC compared with traditional ADC therapies.
As a result, we believe Dolaflexin has the potential to offer the following benefits relative to traditional ADCs:
•Proprietary DolaLock Payload: Dolaflexin is loaded with our proprietary auristatin chemotherapeutic drug, which is a highly potent anti-tubulin agent selectively toxic to rapidly dividing cells, with the advantages of the DolaLock controlled bystander effect.
•Higher Drug-to-Antibody Ratio: Historically, ADCs have been limited to a DAR of 3-4. The Dolaflexin platform can deliver ADCs with DAR of about 10, allowing for greater efficacy while also maintaining pharmacokinetics and drug-like properties.
•Expanded Range of Addressable Tumor Targets: The higher DAR enabled by Dolaflexin results in more chemotherapeutic drug released into the tumor cell for every ADC internalized. As a result, Dolaflexin ADCs can have efficacy against tumor targets with lower levels of antigen expression where traditional ADCs have not been effective.
We believe these advantageous characteristics of our Dolaflexin platform provide a substantial opportunity to develop clinically meaningful ADC therapies with potential to address a broader range of cancers than traditional ADC-based approaches. Our lead clinical candidate, UpRi, is a Dolaflexin ADC that targets NaPi2b. UpRi is currently in a proof-of-concept study in patients with ovarian cancer and NSCLC adenocarcinoma.
Dolasynthen Platform
The Dolasynthen platform enables an iterative approach to develop the right ADC for a given indication through customization and optimization. Dolasynthen utilizes a synthetic scaffold for precise control of DAR, from 2-24, and site-specific antibody bioconjugation. The platform is also able to homogeneously generate ADCs with precisely defined DARs for consistent drug delivery to cancer cells. The Dolasynthen scaffold has been precisely designed to provide optimal water solubility, charge balance, linker stability and DAR. We believe that Dolasynthen retains the favorable properties of Dolaflexin, including our proprietary DolaLock technology for a controlled bystander effect, with superior physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties.
Illustrated by our preclinical data, optimized Dolasynthen ADCs exhibit a broad therapeutic index as a cancer therapy. These data demonstrate the ability of the Dolasynthen platform to generate and identify the optimal ADC for a given target and antibody.
We believe that Dolasynthen offers the benefits of Dolaflexin, including the proprietary DolaLock payload, and has the potential to offer the following benefits relative to traditional ADCs:
•Precise Control of DAR: The optimal DAR may vary between different targets and antigens. Dolasynthen allows for precise DARs between 2-24, enabling optimization of the DAR for specific antigens and antibodies.
•Site-Specific Bioconjugation: The site of scaffold bioconjugation to an antibody impacts the overall properties of that ADC. Dolasynthen enables site-specific bioconjugation allowing further ADC optimization.
•Homogenous ADC Development: The DAR and antibody bioconjugation is consistent throughout ADCs developed with the Dolasynthen platform allowing for consistent and precise drug delivery to targeted cancer cells.
•Increased Hydrophilicity: The precise optimization of the hydrophilic moiety on Dolasynthen ADCs allows for increased aqueous solubility and enhanced pharmacokinetic properties.
Our second clinical candidate, XMT-1592, is a Dolasynthen ADC targeting NaPi2b-expressing tumors. In the first half of 2020 we initiated a Phase 1 dose escalation trial of XMT-1592 in ovarian cancer and NSCLC adenocarcinoma. XMT-1660, our B7-H4 targeted ADC, was selected as our next Dolasynthen ADC and is currently in IND-enabling studies.
Immunosynthen STING-Agonist ADC Platform and Pipeline
Immunosynthen is our novel immunostimulatory ADC platform designed to take ADCs beyond traditional cytotoxic payloads and into targeted stimulation of the innate immune system. Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) is a well-studied innate immune pathway capable of inducing anti-tumor immune activity. Through the tumor-targeted delivery of a novel STING agonist, ADCs created with our Immunosynthen platform have the potential to address the challenges of efficacy, delivery and tolerability posed by the intratumoral or intravenous injection of free STING agonist. Our preclinical data show that the anti-tumor activity of Immunosynthen STING-agonist ADCs is driven by the targeted activation of the STING pathway in tumor-resident immune cells and in tumor cells, in a target dependent manner. STING pathway activation in both cell types within the tumor provides the potential for enhanced anti-tumor activity with a STING-agonist ADC compared to other innate immune approaches that activate only the immune cells. Further, we have generated preclinical data across multiple, diverse targets by creating Immunosynthen ADCs based on a variety of antibodies directed to those targets and evaluating them in a range of tumor models. In each case we have demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in vivo (including complete tumor regressions) after a single low, well-tolerated dose. Additional characterization has demonstrated increased cytokine expression and immune cell infiltration in the tumor micro environment, as well as the induction of immunological memory. We have demonstrated excellent tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of Immunosynthen ADCs in non-human primates, after multiple intravenous doses and at exposures significantly higher than those required for robust efficacy in mice.
Immunosynthen ADCs have been designed to overcome the limitations of free STING agonists and to offer a highly differentiated approach from other innate immune activators due to the following:
•Systemic Administration with Targeted Delivery: ADCs have the convenience of systemic administration with potential to provide targeted delivery specifically to all tumor lesions, including metastatic sites.
•Improved Therapeutic Index: Conjugation of the STING agonist provides protection in the systemic circulation to minimize off-target effects.
•Enhanced Pharmacokinetic Properties: The prolonged pharmacokinetics of ADCs and active transport into tumor cells and tumor-resident immune cells can overcome pharmacokinetic and permeability issues of the free agonists, resulting in more robust and sustained activation of the innate immune response in the tumor.
•Immunosynthen STING ADCs Provide Targeted Activation in Two Cell Types:  Because STING, unlike other innate immune pathways, can be activated in tumor cells and tumor-resident immune cells, target-dependent delivery can result in innate immune activation of both cell types, providing potent and robust anti-tumor responses and the induction of immunological memory.
Figure 2. Immunosynthen ADCs Active Against Diverse Tumor Antigens and Tumor-Associated Antigens in Multiple Models After Single, Low IV Dose
We are building a pipeline of Immunosynthen ADC candidates applicable to a broad range of clinical indications. Our first Immunosynthen ADC development candidate, XMT-2056, is in IND-enabling studies.
Our product candidates
We are leveraging our platforms to develop a robust pipeline of clinically meaningful cancer therapies. Our pipeline strategy focuses on targets that have been biologically validated (either as ADCs or through another modality), where the advantages of our platforms may lead to clinically superior therapeutic benefits, where we have the potential to achieve first-in-class status, and where fast-to-market opportunities are available. Our lead product candidate, UpRi, is in a Phase 1 proof-of-concept study with expansion cohorts in ovarian cancer and NSCLC adenocarcinoma. We expect to initiate a single-arm registration strategy in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, UPLIFT, and a combination dose escalation study, UPGRADE, in ovarian cancer in 2021. Our next product candidate, XMT-1592, is in a Phase 1 dose escalation study. We are also advancing a potentially first-in-class B7-H4-targeted Dolasynthen ADC, XMT-1660, currently in IND-enabling studies and have nominated our first Immunosynthen development candidate, XMT-2056, currently in IND-enabling studies. In addition, our partners have multiple ADC product candidates leveraging our Dolaflexin technology in development.
Upifitamab rilsodotin (UpRi, XMT-1536): our NaPi2b-targeted Dolaflexin ADC
UpRi, a first-in-class ADC targeting the sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein NaPi2b, utilizes the Dolaflexin platform to deliver about 10 DolaLock payload molecules per antibody. The NaPi2b antigen is broadly expressed in NSCLC adenocarcinoma and ovarian cancer with limited expression in normal tissue. NaPi2b is a member of the SLC34 family of sodium-dependent transporters and plays an important role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis. There are currently no tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to measure NaPi2b expression on tumor cells. Given the prevalence of its expression on epithelial ovarian and NSCLC adenocarcinoma tumors, our initial clinical studies of UpRi are being conducted without prospective identification of patients with NaPi2b-expressing tumors. Nonetheless, we have developed 
an immunohistochemistry assay to measure NaPi2b expression which we intend to use retrospectively to confirm the broad prevalence of NaPi2b expression in our target patient populations while correlating those expression levels with the efficacy observed in such patients. We are currently collaborating with a third party to create and obtain regulatory approval for our assay as a commercial companion or complementary diagnostic.
In March 2020, we presented data from the UpRi Phase 1 dose escalation study establishing the maximum tolerated dose and showing encouraging clinical activity with confirmed responses and prolonged stable disease in heavily pretreated patients, without pre-selection for NaPi2b expression. Interim data from the expansion portion of the ongoing UpRi Phase 1 study were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) virtual meeting in May 2020. Updated interim data from the ovarian cancer cohort of the UpRi Phase 1 Expansion Study were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) virtual meeting in September 2020, as well as at a virtual analyst and investor day in January 2021. These data showed clinically meaningful activity in heavily-pretreated patients with an objective response rate >30% and complete responses in patients with ovarian cancer with higher NaPi2b expression. While serious adverse events have been experienced in this heavily-pretreated population, the data showed that UpRi was generally well tolerated without the severe toxicities commonly seen with other ADCs such as neutropenia, ocular toxicities, or peripheral neuropathy. We continue to enroll ovarian cancer and NSCLC adenocarcinoma patients in the expansion portion of the Phase 1 study.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, data from the expansion portion of the Phase 1 study of UpRi in ovarian cancer were discussed with the FDA in order to inform the design and initiation of a single-arm registration strategy in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, to be named UPLIFT. We plan to initiate UPLIFT to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UpRi in heavily-pretreated platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. Patients with one to four prior lines of therapy may enroll without regard to NaPi2b expression; however, the role of the biomarker will be evaluated retrospectively. Patients with three to four prior lines of therapy may enroll without prior bevacizumab treatment, accommodating differences in bevacizumab use in early disease. The primary endpoint will be the objective response rate, or ORR, in the higher NaPi2b patient population and the secondary endpoints will be the ORR regardless of NaPi2b expression, as well as duration of response and safety. The single-arm registration strategy will be initiated as an amendment to the ongoing multinational, multi-center, open label study protocol leveraging expansion enrollment momentum. We expect to enroll approximately 100 patients with higher NaPi2b expression and up to 180 patients overall. The single-arm registration strategy is intended to support a potential regulatory submission under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway.
We also expect to initiate a combination dose escalation study, to be named UPGRADE, in earlier lines of ovarian cancer in 2021. UPGRADE is expected to evaluate the combination of UpRi with a variety of other agents, starting with a platinum chemotherapy. This study is designed to inform the lifecycle management strategy for UpRi in earlier lines of ovarian cancer, including platinum-sensitive disease.
In August 2020, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for UpRi.
XMT-1592: our NaPi2b targeted Dolasynthen ADC
XMT-1592 was created using our Dolasynthen platform and also targets NaPi2b. XMT-1592 comprises the same proprietary NaPi2b antibody and potent auristatin DolaLock payload with controlled bystander effect as UpRi, with the additional features of homogeneous, site-specific bioconjugation and precise DAR. Preclinically, XMT-1592 has shown a differentiated profile particularly in NSCLC adenocarcinoma, where it was four times more efficacious than UpRi, consistent with higher tumor penetration, as described in below in Figure 2. Based on these preclinical data, we believe that XMT-1592 has the potential to provide us with a second opportunity to treat NSCLC adenocarcinoma patients. XMT-1592 is in a Phase 1 dose escalation study in patients with ovarian cancer and NSCLC adenocarcinoma. We plan to evaluate the clinical differentiation of Dolasynthen by leveraging our experience in NaPi2b to rapidly progress XMT-1592 through dose escalation.
Figure 3. XMT-1592 Shows Four-Fold Greater Efficacy in Lung Tumor Model

XMT-1660: our B7-H4 targeted Dolasynthen ADC candidate
Our early stage programs include XMT-1660, a potentially first-in-class B7-H4-targeted ADC development candidate, created with our Dolasynthen platform, addressing areas of high unmet medical need. The expression profile of B7-H4 is well suited for our unique DolaLock payload. B7-H4 can be expressed in two places: on tumor cells and on immunosuppressive tumor associated macrophages, or TAMs, which may lead to additional processing of the ADC and more payload in the tumor environment. DolaLock’s dual mechanisms of action with a direct cytotoxic effect as well as an immunostimulatory effect through dendritic cell activation and immunogenic cell death are well suited to the biology of the B7-H4 target. We have generated favorable efficacy and non-human primate tolerability data with both Dolaflexin and Dolasynthen ADCs targeting B7-H4. Our objective in 2021 is to rapidly progress XMT-1660 through IND-enabling studies and scale up manufacturing activities with third parties. B7-H4 provides significant opportunities for development in areas of high unmet need such as breast cancer, endometrial and ovarian cancer. 
Figure 4. XMT-1660 Selected Based on Direct Comparison of Candidates in Multiple In Vivo Models

XMT-2056: our First Immunosynthen ADC candidate
Our early stage programs also include XMT-2056, our first STING-agonist ADC development candidate, created using our Immunosynthen platform. The therapeutic rationale of an Immunosynthen ADC is to selectively deliver the STING agonist to tumor cells and tumor-resident immune cells in a target-dependent manner, while avoiding delivery to healthy tissues. Our preclinical studies have demonstrated that XMT-2056 has robust activity, resulting in complete tumor regressions in mouse models after a single intravenous low dose. In addition, preclinical studies have also shown excellent tolerability in multi-dose non-human primate, or NHP, studies after intravenous dosing, at exposure levels far exceeding those needed for complete responses in mouse models, which indicates a high preclinical therapeutic index. XMT-2056 is in IND-enabling studies.

Ovarian cancer unmet need and epidemiology
Worldwide, ovarian cancer had incidence of approximately 295,000 and caused an estimated 185,000 deaths in 2018. With a U.S. incidence of approximately 25,000 new cases (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers) and mortality of 14,000 in 2020, ovarian cancer was the second most common gynecologic malignancy and the most common cause of gynecologic cancer death in the United States. The majority of ovarian malignancies (approximately 90%) are derived from epithelial cells. Diagnosis is made histologically, and evaluation is commonly performed following surgical removal of an ovary or fallopian tube or biopsies of the peritoneum. The ovarian cancer standard of care is characterized by initial surgery followed by platinum-containing chemotherapy followed by periods of either observation or maintenance. Nearly 85% of ovarian cancer patients typically relapse following initial treatment. Subsequent treatment depends on the depth and duration of response to initial platinum treatment. Ovarian cancer patients who progress within six months of completion of platinum-based therapy are considered to have platinum-resistant disease. Unmet medical need is significant for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer as treatment options are mainly limited to single agent chemotherapies such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan and paclitaxel. Multiple Phase 3 studies of single agent chemotherapies in patients with platinum-resistant disease and one to three prior therapies have exhibited an overall response rate of 4-12% and median progression-free survival of 3-4 months.
With targeted agents approved in platinum-resistant disease increasingly being prescribed in earlier lines of therapy, the unmet need is expected to remain severe. Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy is indicated to treat a subset of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients with no more than two prior therapies but it is not always well-tolerated and has shown no overall survival benefit. Use of bevacizumab in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy in the frontline and platinum-sensitive recurrent settings mean an increasing number of platinum-resistant patients are pre-treated with bevacizumab and are not candidates for additional bevacizumab combination treatment. More recently, PARP inhibitors have been approved for heavily-pretreated ovarian cancer including platinum-resistant disease. However, they are predominantly used in a subset of patients with cancers harboring BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Similarly, use of PARP inhibitors in earlier lines of recurrent platinum-sensitive maintenance and more recently frontline maintenance therapy following platinum-based chemotherapy means an increasing number of platinum-resistant patients are pre-treated with PARP inhibitors and are not candidates for additional PARP inhibitor therapy.
NSCLC unmet need and epidemiology
Worldwide, lung cancer had an incidence of approximately 2.1 million and caused an estimated 1.7 million deaths in 2018. With a U.S. incidence of approximately 230,000 new cases and over 130,000 deaths in 2020, lung cancer was the most deadly form of cancer in the United States. The five year survival rate is less than 20% on average. Approximately 95% of all lung cancers are classified as either small cell lung cancer or NSCLC. NSCLC can be further divided into squamous or non-squamous. The majority of non-squamous NSCLC is classified as adenocarcinoma. These histological distinctions are important for proper staging, treatment and prognosis. For patients with NSCLC, initial treatment is largely determined by the stage of disease. Surgical resection offers the best opportunity for long-term survival and cure in patients with resectable early-stage NSCLC. Locally-advanced NSCLC is treated by combinations of radiotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. The majority of patients present with inoperable disease. Metastatic NSCLC is managed with systemic chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
The standard of care is evolving for NSCLC with the introduction of immunotherapies for patients without oncogenic driver mutations and new targeted therapies for patients with EGFR, ALK, ROS-1, NTRK or BRAF mutations. For patients with metastatic disease without oncogenic driver mutations, frontline platinum-based chemotherapy is combined with or, depending on PD-L1 expression status, replaced by, immunotherapy using anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies. For patients with metastatic disease harboring oncogenic driver mutations, several generations of targeted agents are available with different resistance profiles. Frontline therapy is often followed by relapse and recurrence and treatment options for these patients are substantially more limited. The standard of care of docetaxel alone or in combination with targeted agents has an overall response rate of 14-23%, median progression-free survival of 3-4 months and median overall survival of 9-12 months.
With PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors and next generation targeted therapies moving into frontline, the unmet need in recurrent lung cancer is expected to remain severe.
Strategic partnerships
Strategic partnerships with leading biopharmaceutical companies to advance Fleximer ADC product candidates
We believe that our ADC platforms have broad applicability across a number of targets. We have used strategic partnering to accelerate bringing Fleximer ADCs to patients. Fleximer is our proprietary, biodegradable, highly biocompatible and water-soluble polymer that is able to carry multiple drug molecules, and it is a key component of our Dolaflexin platform. Since 2012, we have entered into strategic research and development partnerships with Merck KGaA and Asana BioSciences, LLC (by assignment from Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.) to enable development of certain ADC product candidates utilizing Fleximer. In establishing each of these partnerships, our primary objectives were to collaborate with leading biopharmaceutical companies to validate the potential of ADC product candidates utilizing Fleximer, gain meaningful near-term funding and drive significant long-term value. Under each of our partnerships, we own the rights to any improvements to our ADC platform. The details of our material existing strategic partnerships are as follows:
Merck KGaA strategic research and development partnership
In June 2014, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Merck KGaA for the development and commercialization of ADC product candidates utilizing Fleximer for up to six target antigens. We formed a strategic partnership with Merck KGaA because of their expertise in oncology drug development. Under this agreement, we are responsible for generating ADC product candidates against Merck KGaA-selected target antigens. Merck KGaA received rights to select up to six target antigens, of which it has selected all six. Merck KGaA is responsible for generating antibodies against the target antigens, and we are responsible for generating Fleximer and our proprietary payloads and conjugating this to such antibodies to create the ADC product candidates. With respect to each target antigen selected by Merck KGaA, we granted Merck KGaA an exclusive, worldwide license under certain of our Fleximer ADC-related patents and know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize ADC product candidates directed to such target antigen. Merck KGaA is then responsible for the further development and commercialization of these ADC product candidates. In addition, if Merck KGaA advances candidates, we are responsible for manufacturing these ADC product candidates for GLP toxicology studies and Phase 1 clinical studies at Merck KGaA’s expense and Merck KGaA is responsible for all further manufacture of these ADC product candidates. Merck KGaA is required to pay its own costs in the development, commercialization and manufacture of these ADC product candidates and to reimburse us for our costs incurred in performing our research activities under this agreement. The most advanced product candidates in this partnership are in the lead optimization stage.
Through December 31, 2020, we have received an upfront payment of $12 million and milestone payments of $3 million under this agreement. If products are successfully developed and commercialized against all six target antigens, we would be entitled 
to receive future development, regulatory and commercial milestones of up to $777 million. We are entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low- to mid-single digit percentages on net sales of products targeting Merck KGaA’s target antigens during the applicable royalty term if products are successfully developed and commercialized by Merck KGaA under this agreement.
Unless earlier terminated, this agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last royalty term for a product under the agreement in all countries or, if Merck KGaA does not designate any ADC product candidates produced by us under the agreement as preclinical development candidates, upon the expiration of the last-to-expire research program. The royalty term means, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, the period commencing upon the first commercial sale of a product and ending upon the later to occur of: (i) the expiration of the last Mersana patent right that covers or claims the exploitation of such product in such country, or (ii) 10 years from the date of first commercial sale of such product in such country. Upon the expiration of each royalty term for each product on a country-by-country basis, Merck KGaA’s exclusive license will convert to a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license with respect to such product in such country. Merck KGaA may terminate this agreement in its entirety or with respect to any target antigen for convenience upon 60 days’ prior written notice. Each party may terminate this agreement in its entirety upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party.
Asana Biosciences collaboration agreement
In March 2012, we entered to a collaboration agreement with Asana Biosciences, or Asana, formerly part of Endo Pharmaceuticals, to develop next-generation ADCs. Under this agreement, Asana paid us an upfront fee for the right to utilize our Fleximer technology to develop novel ADC candidates against a single cancer target. We are responsible for conducting research and creating ADCs that are conjugates of our diverse, highly potent cytotoxic payloads, our Fleximer polymer and custom linkers, and Asana’s novel antibodies. In addition to providing novel antibodies, Asana is responsible for product development, manufacturing and commercialization of any Fleximer ADC products. Through December 31, 2020, we have received an upfront payment of $0.8 million and milestone payments of $3.3 million under this agreement.
Strategic partnerships to access antibodies and develop new platforms to progress our proprietary pipeline
Our focus is to progress our proprietary pipeline of ADCs. For this reason, we have partnered with biotechnology companies that have the capability to generate high quality antibodies or that have existing antibodies that we can license for inclusion in our ADCs. We have also entered into license agreements with biotechnology companies that own certain patent rights and related know-how that enable us to develop new ADC platforms. These strategic partnerships have facilitated the acceleration of our proprietary pipeline.
Recepta license for the NaPi2b antibody
In July 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Recepta Biopharma S.A., or Recepta, a Brazilian biopharmaceutical company, licensing Recepta’s NaPi2b antibody for use in UpRi and XMT-1592 and granting Recepta the exclusive right to commercialize UpRi and XMT-1592 in Brazil. Under this agreement, Recepta granted us an exclusive license and sub-license with respect to certain patents licensed by Recepta from Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and technology owned by Recepta to develop and exploit products containing Recepta’s NaPi2b antibody, including UpRi and XMT-1592, worldwide for the diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment of human cancer. We granted Recepta an exclusive license under our rights in such patents and technology and certain of our ADC-related patents and technology to commercialize any such products developed by us, including UpRi and XMT-1592, in Brazil. We are responsible for the worldwide development and commercialization of products under this agreement at our own expense in certain major markets, including at least one study site in our Phase 3 clinical studies in Brazil. Recepta may conduct development activities in Brazil at its own expense after providing us the opportunity to first conduct such activities at Recepta’s expense. If a product is successfully developed and commercialized by Recepta in Brazil, we will use diligent efforts to enter into an agreement for the supply of such products to Recepta for sale in Brazil.
Under this agreement, we paid Recepta an upfront payment of $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and are obligated to pay Recepta up to $65.5 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones and tiered royalties in the low-single digit percentages on net sales of products outside of Brazil until the expiration of the royalty term if products are successfully developed and commercialized. Through December 31, 2020, we have paid $1.9 million in milestone payments. We are entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low- to mid-single digit percentages on net sales of products in Brazil until the expiration of the royalty term if products are successfully developed and commercialized. The royalty term means, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, the period ending upon the later of (i) with respect to products commercialized by Mersana, the expiration of the last-to-expire Recepta patent that covers the product in such country (including the term of any applicable supplementary protection certificate) or with respect to products commercialized by 
Recepta, the expiration of the last-to-expire Mersana Patent that covers the product in Brazil (including the term of any applicable supplementary protection certificate) or (ii) 10 years from the date of first commercial sale of such product in such country. Upon the expiration of each royalty term in each country for each applicable product, the exclusive licenses granted to each party under the agreement will become fully-paid up and royalty-free. This agreement will remain in effect until otherwise terminated as set forth below. We may terminate this agreement for convenience in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis (except with respect to Brazil) or product-by-product basis upon 180 days’ prior written notice for a termination in its entirety or upon 45 days’ prior written notice for a termination in part. Each party may terminate this agreement in its entirety upon bankruptcy or similar proceedings of the other party, upon a patent challenge by the other party or upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party. However, if such breach only relates to one country, the agreement may only be terminated with respect to such country.
Synaffix commercial license agreement
In January 2019, we entered into a commercial license agreement with Synaffix B.V., or Synaffix, to develop, manufacture and commercialize ADC targets using Synaffix’s proprietary site-specific conjugation technology for a total of six targets, including XMT-1592. At contract inception we designated the first target and paid an upfront, non-refundable license fee of $0.8 million. We are required to make milestone payments to Synaffix of up to an aggregate of $24.8 million in development and regulatory milestones and up to $20.0 million in one-time sales milestones based on the achievement of annual sales objectives for the first target. In addition, upon designation of additional targets, we will be obligated to pay in the range of $44.8 million to $62.0 million for issuance, development, regulatory and one time sales milestones. Through December 31, 2020, we have paid $0.8 million in milestone payments. Pursuant to the terms this license agreement, upon commencement of commercial sales of a product, if any, we are required to pay to Synaffix tiered royalties in the low-single digit percentages on net sales of the respective products.
The agreement remains in effect on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim in a patent licensed under the agreement covering such product in such country. Upon the expiration of the agreement for each licensed product in each country, the licenses granted to us for such product in such country will become fully paid-up and perpetual. We may terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis at any time. Either party may terminate the agreement, subject to a specified notice and cure period, for a breach by the other party of a material provision of the agreement or upon an insolvency-related event experienced by the other party.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate and currently have no plans to establish any cGMP compliant manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on external Contract Manufacturing Organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture of product to support our activities through regulatory approval and commercial manufacturing. We have personnel with pharmaceutical development and manufacturing experience who are responsible for the relationships with our CMOs. In the future, we expect to use these CMOs to manufacture commercial supply of our products, which will require these CMOs to increase scale of production. We do not currently have qualified alternate suppliers in the event the current CMOs that we utilize are unable to scale production for commercial manufacturing. The Dolaflexin and Dolasynthen manufacturing processes involve readily available starting materials and use unit operations that are well-precedented in the field of chemical/pharmaceutical production. The current UpRi supply chain utilizes the same vendors that we could use for commercialization. The current XMT-1592 supply chain utilizes the same vendors that we could use for commercialization with the exception of components necessary for the Synaffix bioconjugation technology, where the identification of a commercially capable vendor is ongoing.
Government regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, clinical and preclinical studies, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including imposition of a clinical hold, refusal to approve marketing applications, withdrawal of an approval, import/export delays, issuance of warning letters and other types of 
enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties.
Review and approval in the United States
In the United States, our ADC product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. The FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and associated implementing regulations. The failure to comply with the FDCA, the PHS Act and other applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement-related letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities.
A biologic may not be marketed in the United States until it has been approved by the FDA. The steps before a biological product may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
•the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND application which must take effect before human clinical studies may begin in the United States;
•approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB representing each clinical site before each clinical study may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for each indication, conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements;
•preparation and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA;
•FDA acceptance and review of the BLA, which might include an Advisory Committee review;
•satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•satisfactory completion of any FDA inspections or audits of the sponsor, clinical research organizations and clinical study sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the clinical data;
•payment of user fees, if any, for FDA review of the BLA; 
•FDA approval of the BLA; and 
•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, where applicable, and post-approval studies required by the FDA as a condition of approval.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain.
Preclinical studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate for use in humans. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Additional preclinical testing, such as toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
Clinical studies
Clinical studies involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. GCP requirements include, among other things, conducting the study in accordance with a written protocol, maintaining the integrity of study data, obtaining informed consent from study subjects and approval and ongoing review of the study by an IRB.
A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical study or places the study on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin.
Clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, which may overlap or be combined:
Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in some cases, patients with the target disease (e.g., cancer) or condition. In Phase 1, the product candidate is typically tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites, in well-controlled clinical studies to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Phase 4 clinical studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of products approved under accelerated approval regulations or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post-market requirements or commitments.
Clinical studies at each phase of development may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA, an IRB, the sponsor or the data monitoring committee, if applicable, may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
Submission of a marketing application to the FDA
Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
BLA pathway
Our ADC product candidates must be licensed via FDA approval of a BLA under Section 351 of the PHS Act on the basis of a demonstration that the product is safe, pure and potent. Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review BLAs within ten months of the filing date for standard review or six months of the filing date for priority review. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
Before approving the BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the biological product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the facility is compliant with cGMPs. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical study sites for compliance with GCP and integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy.
During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether to require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 clinical studies and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved biologics after they are commercialized. In addition, the FDA will determine whether the biologic will require a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA will issue either an approval of the BLA or a Complete Response Letter, detailing the deficiencies in the submission and the additional testing or information required for reconsideration of the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical studies, be conducted to further assess the product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions, including a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Fast track, breakthrough therapy and priority review designations
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
First, the FDA may designate a product for “fast track” review if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s BLA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees.
Second, the FDA may designate a product as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical studies in an efficient manner.
Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications and shortens the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months from the filing date.
Accelerated approval pathway
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments. A product eligible for accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of 
products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large studies to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical studies to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Post-approval requirements
Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for certain supplemental applications.
In addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences of regulatory non-compliance or post-market problems with a product include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning or other enforcement-related letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Such products may be promoted only for the approved indications and consistent with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Biosimilars and exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, or the Health Care Reform Act, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be 
biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity requires a showing that the product is “highly similar” to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
A reference biologic is entitled to 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product. In addition, the first biological product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with, not just biosimilar to, the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Further, since the BPCIA was enacted as part of the overall Health Care Reform Act, current litigation challenges to that Act, discussed more in full below, could impact the validity of the BPCIA. As a result, there still remains significant uncertainty as to the ultimate impact, implementation and regulatory interpretation of the BPCIA.
Pediatric studies and exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, all applications for new active ingredients, new indications, new dosage forms, new dosing regimens or new routes of administration are required to contain an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication in pediatric patients unless this requirement is waived, deferred or inapplicable.
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, a product may be eligible for pediatric exclusivity, which, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued written request for such a study.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product, including a biological product, as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, a disease for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.
A product that receives the first FDA approval for a product for the indication for which it has orphan designation is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity.
Patent term restoration
A patent claiming a new product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
FDA Approval or Clearance of Companion Diagnostics
As described above, we may seek approval or partner with a third-party to seek approval of a companion diagnostic for one or more of our ADC product candidates. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs and biologics, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostic devices on issues related to co-development of the products. 
Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. 
The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to a product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee.
A clinical trial is typically required for a PMA application and, in a small percentage of cases, the FDA may require a clinical study in support of a 510(k) submission. A manufacturer that wishes to conduct a clinical study involving the device is subject to the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulation. The IDE regulations distinguish between significant and non-significant risk device studies and the procedures for obtaining approval to begin the study differ accordingly. Also, some types of studies are exempt from the IDE regulations. A significant risk device presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. Significant risk devices are devices that are substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or in preventing impairment to human health. Studies of devices that pose a significant risk require both FDA and an IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study. Many companion diagnostics are considered significant risk devices due to their role in diagnosing a disease or condition. Non-significant risk devices are devices that do not pose a significant risk to the human subjects. A non-significant risk device study requires only IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. 
In the United States, device manufacturers are also subject to FDA’s medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur, and FDA’s correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
Review and approval outside the United States
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical studies or 
marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and other geographies, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to the national health authority and an independent ethics committee in each country in which the company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs and other applicable regulatory requirements and ethical principles.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, region-specific document requirements.
The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, upon receiving marketing authorization, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
The collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Economic Area, including personal health data, is subject to the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches and taking certain measures when engaging third-party data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability and adequacy of third-party payor reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, including authorities at the U.S. federal and state level, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for, examining the medical necessity of and assessing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the 
product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs and biologics have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies, or so called health technology assessments, to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company.
The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and biologics, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
Healthcare law and regulation
Within the United States, the activities of pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation and our activities could possibly be subject to challenge as a result. Laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate (including certain laws that will apply if and when we have a product approved for marketing) include:
•federal false claims, false statements and civil monetary penalties laws prohibiting, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid;
•the federal anti-kickback law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchasing or ordering of, a good or service, for which payment may be made, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;
•the federal anti-kickback prohibition known as Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act or EKRA, enacted in 2018, which prohibits certain payments related to referrals of patients to certain providers (recovery homes, clinical treatment facilities and laboratories) and applies to services reimbursed by private health plans as well as government health care programs;
•the federal law known as HIPAA, which, in addition to privacy protections applicable to healthcare providers and other entities (see “Government regulation – Data privacy and security”), prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program (which may include private health plans) or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
•the FDCA, which among other things, strictly regulates drug marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of samples;
•the federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs;
•the so-called “federal sunshine” law, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report certain financial interactions with teaching hospitals, physicians, and certain non-physician practitioners to the federal government for re-disclosure to the public ; and
•state law analogues of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private health plans, and state and local laws regulating interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers, requiring disclosure of such financial interactions or mandating adoption of certain compliance standards, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.
We will be required to spend substantial time and money to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. Violations of these laws can subject us to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions including monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and reputational harm. Additionally, we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. Moreover, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state laws and regulations, proposed and implemented, that could impact our future operations and business.
Healthcare reform
Our revenue and operations could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the United States and elsewhere. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery or payment for healthcare products and services could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition.
In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of significant legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. Federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, the Health Care Reform Act expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs. Under the Trump administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Act. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty established under Health Care Reform Act for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The Health Care Reform Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. The case Texas v. Azar, which challenges the constitutionality of the Health Care Reform Act, including provisions that are unrelated to healthcare reform but were enacted as part of the Health Care Reform Act, was argued before the Supreme Court in November 2020. Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the Health Care Reform Act but the individual mandate to buy health insurance remains in effect.
Beyond the Health Care Reform Act, there have been ongoing health care reform efforts, including a number of recent actions. Some recent healthcare reform efforts have sought to address certain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including an expansion of telehealth coverage under Medicare and accelerated or advanced Medicare payments to healthcare providers. Other reform efforts affect pricing or payment for drug products. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program has been subject to statutory and regulatory changes and the discount that manufacturers of Medicare Part D brand name drugs must provide to Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap from 50% to 70%. A number of regulations were issued in late 2020 and early 2021. For example, effective January, 2022, revisions to the federal antikickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to PBMs and health plans. Some of these changes have been and may continue to be subject to legal challenge. For example, courts temporarily enjoined a new “most favored nation” payment model for select drugs covered under Medicare Part B that was to take effect on January 1, 2021 and would limit payment based on international drug price. The nature and scope of health care reform in the wake of the transition from the Trump administration to the Biden administration remains uncertain. President Biden has temporarily halted implementation of new rules issued immediately prior to the transition that had not yet taken effect (which include a number of health care reforms) to allow for review by the new administration. More generally, President Biden supported reforms to lower drug prices during his campaign for the presidency.
There have also been efforts by federal and state government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There 
have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices.
Adoption of new healthcare reform legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our product candidates if approved for sale. We cannot predict, however, the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or action, or its impact on us, and healthcare reform could increase compliance costs and may adversely affect our future business and financial results.
Data privacy and security
We may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business.
Within the United States, our operations may be affected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, collectively, HIPAA, which impose obligations on certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) and certain of their “business associate” contractors with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Although we believe that we currently are neither a “covered entity” nor a “business associate” under the legislation, HIPAA may affect our interactions with customers who are covered entities or their business associates because HIPAA affects the ability of these entities to disclose patient health information to us. Various states also have laws that regulate the privacy and security of patient information and so may affect our business operations. For example, we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, that became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California consumers (defined to include all California residents) certain rights, including the right to ask companies to disclose the types of personal information collected, specific pieces of information collected by a company, the categories of sources from which such information was collected, the business purpose for collecting or selling the consumer’s personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom a company shares personal information. The CCPA also imposes several obligations on companies to provide notice to California consumers regarding a company’s data processing activities. Additionally, the CCPA gives California consumers the right to ask companies to delete a consumer’s personal information and it places limitations on a company’s ability to sell personal information, including providing consumers a right to opt out of sales of their personal information.
Outside the United States, other data privacy and security regulations may apply. For example, the processing of personal data in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which took effect in May 2018. The GDPR increases obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA, such as in relation to the provision of fair processing notices, exercising data subject rights and reporting certain data breaches to regulators and affected individuals, as well as how we document our relationships with third parties that process GDPR-covered personal data on our behalf. The GDPR also increases the scrutiny applied to transfers of personal data from the EEA (including from clinical trial sites in the EEA) to countries that are considered by the European Commission to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the United States. Adoption of new healthcare reform legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our product candidates if approved for sale. We cannot predict, however, the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or action, or its impact on us, and healthcare reform could increase compliance costs and may adversely affect our future business and financial results.
Compliance with data privacy and security regulation can require allocation of resources as well as changes in operations. Any failure to comply with data protection and privacy laws could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, claims for damages by data subjects, regulatory investigations and enforcement action, litigation and significant costs for remediation, any of which could adversely affect our business. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
Additional regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in foreign countries that impose similar obligations.
Intellectual property
We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including pursuing patents that cover our ADC platform, proprietary composition of matter, ADC product candidates and methods of using and manufacturing the same, as well as any other relevant inventions and improvements that are considered commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position.
Our commercial success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary protection for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business, and to defend our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing U.S., international (under Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT) and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that we consider to be important to the development and implementation of our business.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. In the future, if and when our drug candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical studies for each drug and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustments to the terms of any of our patents.
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our drug candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may currently own or license or may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or have the scope of their claims narrowed. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, which is highly unpredictable. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drug candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property.”
As of January 31, 2021, we owned, in all of our patent portfolios, 21 issued U.S. patents, 12 pending non-provisional U.S. patent applications (including one allowed U.S. patent application), seven pending provisional U.S. patent applications, 95 issued foreign patents, five pending PCT patent applications and 102 pending foreign patent applications (including two allowed foreign patent applications) in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including, but being not limited to, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Eurasia, Gulf Cooperation Council, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Mexico, Macau, Pakistan, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea, South Africa, and Taiwan. Our 10 issued U.S. patents covering our Fleximer ADC platform are projected to expire in 2032, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions; our two issued U.S. patents covering our Dolaflexin ADC platform are projected to expire in 2034 and 2038, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions; our additional nine issued U.S. patents are projected to expire between 2030 and 2037, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions; and any patent that may issue from our pending U.S. applications is projected to expire between 2037 and 2042, in each case, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. In addition, we have exclusively in licensed four issued U.S. patents and one issued European patent for the NaPi2b antibody from Recepta. These in licensed issued U.S. and foreign patents are projected to expire in 2029, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. We have so far not filed for patent protection in all national and regional jurisdictions where such protection may be available. In addition, we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before they are granted. Finally, the grant proceeding of each national or regional patent is an independent proceeding which may lead to 
situations in which applications might in some jurisdictions be refused by the relevant registration authorities, while granted by others. It is also quite common that depending on the country, various scopes of patent protection may be granted on the same product candidate or technology.
The intellectual property portfolio of our ADC platform, our ADC product candidates and components thereof and companion diagnostics are summarized below. Some of these portfolios are in very early stages and prosecution has yet to commence on most of the pending patent applications. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the USPTO may be narrowed (sometimes significantly) by the time they issue, if they issue at all. We expect this to be the case with respect to our pending patent applications referred to below.
Fleximer ADC platform
The intellectual property portfolio for our Fleximer ADC platform is directed to compositions of matter for the Fleximer ADCs, as well as methods of using and making these novel conjugates, compositions of matter for Fleximer drug conjugates prior to conjugation with the antibody or antibody fragment and methods of making the same, and compositions of matter for our proprietary auristatin compounds (and by extension our proprietary DolaLock feature) and conjugates thereof (e.g., to Fleximer and/or an antibody or antibody fragment). As of January 31, 2021, we owned 10 issued U.S. patents, one pending non-provisional U.S. patent application, 48 issued foreign patents, and three pending foreign patent applications in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Macau, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan.

Any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering Dolaflexin ADC platform is projected to expire in 2034, and any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering the method of making the Dolaflexin ADC is projected to expire in 2038, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
UpRi ADC
The intellectual property portfolio for our NaPi2b ADC product candidate, UpRi, is directed to compositions of matter for our novel ADC based on exclusively in licensed NaPi2b antibody and our Dolaflexin platform, as well as methods of using, making these novel conjugates, methods of administration and companion diagnostics. As of January 31, 2021, we owned four pending non-provisional U.S. patent applications (including one allowed U.S. patent application), 37 pending foreign patent applications, and one pending PCT application directed to the composition of matter for UpRi, methods of using and making same, companion diagnostics for UpRi ADC and UpRi dosing regimens. We also intend to enter the national/regional phase of the pending PCT patent application in foreign jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Macau, Mexico and South Africa. Any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering UpRi is projected to expire in 2037, and any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering UpRi companion diagnostics is projected to expire in 2038, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions, and any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering the UpRi dosing regimens is projected to expire in 2039.
In addition, we have exclusively in licensed four issued U.S. patents and one issued European patent for the novel NaPi2b antibody from Recepta, which Recepta licensed from Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. These in licensed issued U.S. and European patents are projected to expire in 2029, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. Recepta still owns one pending Brazilian patent application for the NaPi2b antibody, which is not licensed to us. A patent issuing from this Brazilian patent application is projected to expire in 2029.
Dolasynthen ADC platform
The intellectual property portfolio for our novel Dolasynthen platform is directed to compositions of matter for the novel scaffold and ADCs thereof, as well as methods of using and making these novel conjugates and scaffolds.

We intend to enter the national/regional phase of the PCT patent applications in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including, but mot limited to, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Macau, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan. Any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications is projected to expire between 2040 and 2041, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors and non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that we will have executed such agreements with all applicable employees and contractors, or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights. With respect to the building of our proprietary compound library, we consider trade secrets and know-how to be our primary intellectual property. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, we anticipate that with respect to this technology platform, these trade secrets and know-how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development and public presentations describing the methodology. For more information regarding the risks associated with our trade secrets, please see “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property—Confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.”
Competition
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, and the oncology subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our proprietary ADC platforms and scientific expertise provide us with competitive advantages, a wide variety of institutions, including large biopharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, academic research departments and public and private research institutions, are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies. These competitors generally fall within the following categories:
New cancer treatments: Many global pharmaceutical companies, as well as medium and small biotechnology companies, are pursuing new cancer treatments whether small molecules, biologics or ADCs. Any of these treatments could prove to be superior clinically to our products.
ADC platforms: Although Dolaflexin, Dolasynthen and the new platform initiatives we have underway are highly differentiated and proprietary, many companies continue to invest in innovation in the ADC field including new payload classes, new conjugation approaches and new targeting moieties. Any of these initiatives could lead to a platform that has superior properties to ours. We are also aware of multiple companies with ADC technologies that may be competitive to our platforms, including Daiichi Sankyo, ImmunoGen, Gilead (Immunomedics), Pfizer and SeaGen. These companies or their partners, including Astellas, AstraZeneca, AbbVie, Genentech/Roche and Takeda, may develop product candidates which compete in the same indications as our current and future product candidates. We expect to compete on improved efficacy, safety and tolerability compared to other product candidates and if our products are not demonstrably superior in these respects compared to other approved therapeutics, we may not be able to compete effectively.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our products’ entry. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety and tolerability of our product candidates.
Employees and Human Capital
As of January 31, 2021, we had 110 full time employees, including 76 with M.D., Ph.D. or other advanced degrees. Of these full time employees, 87 are engaged in research and development and 23 are engaged in general and administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunity for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth, and a robust employment package that promotes wellness across all aspects of their lives, including healthcare, retirement planning, and paid time off. 
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We occupy approximately 35,000 square feet of office and laboratory space that we lease in the multi-tenant building in which our corporate headquarters are located. We have an option to extend the lease term for an additional five years thereafter. We believe that this office and laboratory space is sufficient to meet our current needs and that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed.
