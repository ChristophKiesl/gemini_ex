ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We were incorporated under the name Foreclosure Solutions, Inc. in the State of Texas on December 9, 2010. On July 25, 2013, the Company’s predecessor, CannaVest Corp., a Texas corporation (“CannaVest Texas”), merged with the Company, a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary of CannaVest Texas, to effectuate a change in the Company’s state of incorporation from Texas to Delaware. On January 4, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, reflecting its corporate name change to “CV Sciences, Inc.”, effective on January 5, 2016. In addition, on January 4, 2016, the Company amended its Bylaws to reflect its corporate name change to “CV Sciences, Inc.” The Company previously operated under the corporate name of CannaVest Corp. On June 8, 2016, the Company changed its trading symbol from CANV to CVSI, and continues to be traded on the OTC: QB.
 
The change in corporate name was undertaken in connection with the acquisition of CanX Inc., a Florida corporation (“CanX”). As more fully set forth in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 4, 2016 (the “CanX 8-K”), on December 30, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Purchase Agreement”) with CANNAVEST Merger Sub, Inc., a Florida corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), CANNAVEST Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “LLC”), CanX and the Starwood Trust, as the Shareholders’ Representative (the “CanX Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into CanX with CanX surviving such merger. Immediately following effectiveness of the merger, CanX merged with and into the LLC with the LLC surviving such merger. Upon consummation of these transactions, CanX ceased to exist and all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of CanX vested in the LLC, and all debts, liabilities and duties of CanX became the debts, liabilities and duties of the LLC. In consideration for the acquisition of CanX and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cannabine, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, the Company paid and issued to the former shareholders of CanX at closing an aggregate sum of $250,000 in cash and 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, subject to the Company achieving certain post-closing milestones, the Company was previously required to pay and issue certain additional contingent consideration to the former shareholders of CanX, as more particularly set forth in the CanX 8-K. As further discussed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 22, 2017 (the March 2017 8-K), on March 16, 2017, the parties to the Purchase Agreement entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue the additional contingent consideration without the Company having achieved the remaining post-closing milestones and agreed to certain revisions to the buy-out option of the Company for the royalty payments otherwise due to the former shareholders of CanX, as further discussed in the CanX 8-K.
 
Following the CanX Acquisition, the Company has two distinct business segments, a specialty pharmaceutical segment focused on developing and commercializing novel therapeutics utilizing synthetic Cannabidiol (“CBD”); and, a consumer product segment focused on manufacturing, marketing and selling plant-based CBD products to a range of market sectors.
 
Pharmaceuticals
 Our specialty pharmaceutical segment is developing synthetic cannabinoids to treat a range of medical conditions. Cannabinoids are compounds derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, which contain two primary cannabinoids, CBD, and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Clinical and preclinical data suggest that CBD has promising results in treating a range of medical indications. We acquired two product candidates in the CanX Acquisition, each utilizing synthetic CBD as the active pharmaceutical ingredient.
 
The Company’s first patent-pending product candidate, CVSI-007, combines CBD and nicotine in treatment of smokeless tobacco use and addiction. There are currently no drugs approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) for treatment of smokeless tobacco use and addiction. We believe this product candidate will provide treatment options for this significant unmet medical need. The Company is hopeful to be in a position to file an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) with the FDA in the future. We expect to hold a pre-IND meeting with the FDA during the first half of 2017 to obtain guidance on this development program. CVSI-007 is based on proprietary formulations, processes and technology that we believe are patent-protectable, with an application that expires in 2036.
 
Consumer Products
 We manufacture, market and sell consumer products containing plant-based CBD under our PlusCBD™ brand in a range of market sectors including nutraceutical, beauty care, specialty foods and vape. We expect to continue to add new products to our PlusCBD™ portfolio to enhance our line of CBD and hemp-related consumer products. We also expect to develop and launch new brands to more effectively market and sell certain products. We also sell raw materials acquired by us through our supply relationships in Europe to various customers that produce products for resale into the market.
 
We seek to take advantage of an emerging worldwide trend to re-energize the production of industrial hemp and to foster its many uses for consumers. Historically cultivated for industrial and practical purposes, hemp is used today for textiles, paper, auto parts, biofuel, cosmetics, animal feed, nutritional supplements and much more. The market for hemp-derived products is expected to increase substantially over the next five years, and we believe CV Sciences is well positioned to be a significant player in the hemp industry.

We expect to realize revenue to fund a portion of our working capital needs through the sale of finished products and raw materials to third parties. However, in order to fund our drug development efforts, we will need to raise additional capital either through the issuance of equity and/or the issuance of debt. 
 
Current Operations
 
Specialty Pharmaceuticals
 We currently contract with qualified parties and contract research organizations for our preclinical research and IND preparation and development. Commercialization of future specialty pharmaceutical products in the United States and other territories may rely on licensing and co-promotion agreements with strategic partners. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States, such commercial infrastructure could include a sales organization, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support.
Consumer Products
 We utilize internal resources to manufacture, market, and sell products containing hemp-derived CBD primarily under our PlusCBD™ brand. Hemp-derived CBD is one of at least 80 cannabinoids found in hemp, and is non-psychoactive. Our U.S. based operations oversee our raw material supply chain, raw material processing, product development and manufacturing, and sales and marketing. We will continue to scale-up our processing capability to accommodate new products in our pipeline.
 
Description of our Subsidiaries
 
The Company owns 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of two subsidiaries: Plus CBD, LLC (formerly, “Global Hemp Source, LLC”) (“Plus CBD”), and the LLC. The Company also owned a 70% interest in CannaVest Europe, GmbH. On May 2, 2016, the Company filed Articles of Dissolution for its wholly-owned subsidiaries US Hemp Oil, LLC and CannaVest Laboratories, LLC (formerly, “PhytoSPHERE Systems, LLC”) with the Secretary of State of Nevada, effective as of April 29, 2016. On January 20, 2017, the Company filed for dissolution of CannaVest Europe, GmbH, an entity that prior to dissolution, the Company had a 70% interest in, with the District Court, Dusseldorf Germany, effective December 31, 2016. None of US Hemp Oil, CannaVest Laboratories and CannaVest Europe GmbH had any assets or liabilities at the time of their dissolution.
 
Inventory and Sales
 
Based on expected increasing demand, we have invested significant capital to develop and maintain relationships with growers on a global scale to ensure access to raw materials to support anticipated revenue growth. We source our raw materials from well-established and well-recognized hemp growers in Europe. We have arrangements with some of these growers for exclusive rights to their supply. Despite this already large footprint, we continue to explore and develop other relationships to ensure that we can meet the expected demand for bulk hemp products well into the future. Our current inventory levels are sufficient to support sales through 2017, resulting in reduced cash outflow for inventory purchases. In addition, we do not intend to purchase raw inventory from our supply chain arrangements from the 2017 crop and/or 2018 crop. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment of inventory expense of $3,562,459 (See Note 4 of the Company’s consolidated financial statements).
 
Subject to applicable law, we have initiated hemp research and development studies in the U.S. in Kentucky through partnerships with the Kentucky State Department of Agriculture and several universities, on a pilot scale.
 
Changes in the Law and Development Programs
 
For the first time since 1937, industrial hemp has been decriminalized at the federal level and can be grown legally in the United States, but on a limited basis. A landmark provision passed in the Agricultural Act of 2014 recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana. Federal law now exempts industrial hemp from U.S. drug laws to allow for crop research by universities, colleges and state agriculture departments. The new Federal law allows for agricultural pilot programs for industrial hemp “in states that permit the growth or cultivation of hemp.”
 
Under the jurisdiction of the Agricultural Act of 2014, we entered into two separate agreements during 2015. We entered an agreement with the Kentucky State Department of Agriculture to complete research under pilot studies with farmers and processors of CBD. In addition, we entered into an agreement with the University of Kentucky to fund research regarding cultivation techniques to increase CBD production. We are also evaluating opportunities within Kentucky to invest in processing facilities and equipment in support of our consumer products business segment.

Market, Customers and Distribution Methods
 
The market, customers and distribution methods for hemp-based products are large and diverse. These markets range from hemp-based bio plastics to textiles. This is an ever-evolving distribution system that today includes early adopter retailers and ecommerce entities, and product development companies that use our PlusCBD™ brand oil to develop consumer products for distribution. The number of “mainstream” commercial and retail stores that currently stock and sell our products is increasing primarily through customer awareness. We believe that as awareness grows for the “green”, environmentally-friendly products derived from hemp\cannabis, the consumer market will adapt its current product lines to integrate them with hemp-based additives or replace harmful components in their existing products with the components of hemp.
 
Our target customers for our consumer product segment are first and foremost end consumers via internet sales, direct-to-consumer health and wellness stores, collectives, cooperatives, affiliate sales and master distributors. Secondarily, we are targeting manufacturers of products that can readily replace their raw base materials for our base materials, making the products more environmentally friendly and sustainable. In the future, we intend to target national and regional broker networks and major distribution companies who have preexisting relationships with major retail chain stores. In addition, we are directly pursuing distribution opportunities with national retailers. As we continue to develop our business, these markets may change, be re-prioritized or eliminated as management responds to consumer and regulatory developments.
 
Competition
 
There are several companies developing cannabinoid therapeutics for a range of medical indications. The cannabinoid therapeutic area currently includes formulated extracts of the Cannabis plant and synthetic formulations. These formulations include CBD and THC, or a combination of CBD/THC as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Certain companies such as GW Pharmaceuticals, PLC have focused on plant-based CBD formulations; while other companies such as Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Insys Therapeutics Inc. have focused on synthetic CBD formulations.
 
The CBD-based consumer product industry is highly fragmented with numerous companies, many of which are under-capitalized. We routinely evaluate internal and external opportunities to optimize value for shareholders through new product development or by asset acquisitions or sales. There are also large, well-funded companies that currently do not offer hemp-based consumer products but may do so in the future.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have filed trademark applications on our brands, logos and marks including, but not limited to CV Sciences and Plus CBD. On January 30, 2016, we received a Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for our utility patent application number 14/791,184, Novel Process for Generating Hemp Oil with a High CBD Content. This patent covers our solvent-free and highly repeatable process for producing hemp oil with higher concentrations of CBD and expires in 2033.
 
We have a pending patent application for our product candidate CVSI-007 in the United States that will expire in 2037.
 
We review our intellectual property portfolio on a periodic basis and we will continue to broaden our portfolio in a fiscally prudent manner. We intend to file for patent protection on our pharmaceutical products based on proprietary formulations, processes and technology.
 
Research and Development
 
We opened a laboratory facility in San Diego, California in September 2013 to advance our CBD consumer products business. Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and include, but are not limited to, employee salaries and benefits, cost of inventory used in product development, consulting service fees, the cost of renting and maintaining our laboratory facility and depreciation of laboratory equipment. Our lab specializes in process development and product testing. We incurred research and development expenses of $1,159,009 and $1,320,003, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Source and Availability of Raw Materials
 
The Company sources its raw materials from well-established and well-recognized hemp growers in Europe. We have arrangements with some of these growers to have exclusive rights to their supply. The Company has two supply arrangements in place with European farmers to supply raw material in future years. We have contractual rights for the growth and processing of hemp oil for delivery through October 2018 under both contracts. We do not intend to purchase any inventory under these supply agreements from the 2017 crop and/or 2018 crop. As such, we recorded an impairment expense during the year ended December 31, 2016, related to acquired goodwill and intangible assets from PhytoSPHERE (See Note 7 of the Company’s consolidated financial statements). In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $3,562,459 impairment of certain raw material inventory (See Note 4 of the Company’s consolidated financial statements).

Environmental Matters
 
Compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had, nor are they expected to have, any material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.
Employees
 
As of March 23, 2017, we had a total of 39 employees; 38 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and none are represented by labor unions. Management believes the Company has good relationships with its employees.
