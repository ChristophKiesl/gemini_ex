Item 1. | Business

Overview
RealNetworks invented the streaming media category in 1995 and continues to build on its foundation of digital media expertise and innovation, creating a new generation of products and services to enhance and secure our daily lives. In recent years, we have increasingly focused on developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based products and services such as our Secure Accurate Facial Recognition (SAFR) computer vision platform and our Kontxt natural language processing-based message classification and analysis product. We provide our software and services to consumers, mobile carriers, device manufacturers, system integrators, and other businesses.
Consumers use our digital media products and services to store, organize, play, manage and enjoy their digital media content, either directly from us or through our distribution partners. For 25 years, RealNetworks has advanced the renowned RealPlayer, which has provided millions of people worldwide a powerful way to download, store, organize, and experience the rapidly expanding universe of digital media content, regardless of format. Our SAFR computer vision platform, a key investment initiative for us, enables new applications for security, convenience, and analytics, and is optimized for live video. Our consumer products feature GameHouse Original Stories, a unique IP portfolio of free-to-play mobile games. Our consumer products also include ringback tones, which we license to mobile operators, and our video compression and enhancement technology, which we primarily license to OEMs, including manufacturers of mobile devices, smart TVs, and set-top boxes. Our product line also includes Kontxt, our AI-based platform for categorizing Application to Person (A2P) messages to help messaging aggregators and mobile carriers provide a better customer experience, strengthen customer loyalty, and drive new revenue through text message management, classification and anti-spam.
The monetization, distribution, and licensing of our technology products and services are heavily dependent on contracts with third parties, such as mobile carriers, system integrators, and device manufacturers. 
We were incorporated in 1994 in the State of Washington. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol "RNWK."
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("10-K") for the year ended December 31, 2020, RealNetworks, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is referred to as "RealNetworks," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our." "RealPlayer," "RMHD," "RealMedia," "GameHouse," "Kontxt," "SAFR" and other trademarks of ours appearing in this report are our property.
Segments
We report revenue and operating income (loss) in three segments: (1) Consumer Media, (2) Mobile Services, and (3) Games. RealNetworks allocates to its Consumer Media, Mobile Services, and Games segments certain corporate expenses which are directly attributable to supporting these businesses, including but not limited to a portion of finance, IT, legal, human resources and headquarters facilities. Remaining expenses, which are not directly attributable to supporting these businesses, are reported as corporate items. These corporate items also can include restructuring charges and stock compensation expense. 
As described in Note 4. Acquisitions and Dispositions, RealNetworks acquired an additional 42% interest in Rhapsody International, Inc. (doing business as Napster) on January 18, 2019, which brought our ownership of Napster's outstanding stock to 84%, thus giving us a majority voting interest. For fiscal periods following the closing of the acquisition, we consolidated Napster's financial results into our financial statements, where Napster was reported as a separate segment. In August 2020, we entered into a Support Agreement in connection with the execution by Napster of a definitive agreement pursuant to which Napster would become a wholly owned subsidiary of MelodyVR Group PLC. The transaction closed on December 30, 2020, resulting in our full disposition of our Napster stake. Effective on the execution of the Napster/MelodyVR merger agreement on August 25, 2020, Napster was treated as discontinued operations for accounting and disclosure purposes. As such, Napster's operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and financial condition as of December 31, 2019 have been recast to conform to this presentation. 
Consumer Media
In our Consumer Media segment, revenue is primarily derived from the licensing of our portfolio of video compression and enhancement technology, also known as codec technology. Codecs are an encoding and decoding technology designed to reduce the amount of bits required to stream or store media content, and modern codecs achieve significant savings in streaming bandwidth and storage costs. Our main codec products are RealMedia High Definition, which we refer to as RealMedia HD or RMHD, and RealMedia Variable Bitrate, or RMVB. Our codec technologies business is primarily focused on the Chinese market, where RMVB remains a prevalent, though declining format. 
We continue to develop and innovate our video compression and enhancement technology to meet or exceed user demands for increasing compression efficiency and visual quality. We license our codec technology to a variety of electronic equipment, microchip, and integrated circuit manufacturers who embed our codec in their products, including mobile devices, 
laptops, smart TVs and other devices. To ensure a robust ecosystem for our codec technologies, we also promote the use of our codec technology to producers of media content and users of RealPlayer, thus encouraging the widespread adoption by device manufacturers.
We also generate revenue through online sales to consumers of our PC-based RealPlayer subscription products, including our SuperPass service, which provides consumers with access to digital entertainment content for a monthly fee. The RealPlayer media player, our enduring yet continually evolving software product, includes features and services that enable consumers to discover, play, download, manage and edit digital video, stream audio and video, download and save photos and videos from the web, transfer and share content on social networks, and edit their own photo and video content. As part of our RealPlayer download process, we also offer distribution of third-party software products to consumers, which generates additional revenue.
Mobile Services
Mobile Services consists of the various digital media services we provide to mobile and online service providers as software as a service (SaaS) offerings. In recent years, we have increasingly focused on AI-based products and services such as SAFR and Kontxt.
Included in our SaaS offerings are our messaging products, which include our Metcalfe intercarrier messaging service; Kontxt, our AI-based text message management, anti-spam, and classification product; and our ringback tone service. We provide these services to a large number of mobile carriers around the world, although a significant portion of our revenue for this segment results from contracts with a few mobile carriers and one service partner. We also offer business intelligence, subscriber management and billing for the carriers who make our offerings available to their customers. Also included in this segment is our computer vision platform, SAFR (Secure Accurate Facial Recognition) and our RealTimes platform. 
Our Metcalfe intercarrier messaging platform enables operators to send and receive SMS messages worldwide between networks and service providers, regardless of network technology, typically processing billions of SMS messages per day between users on hundreds of different networks. A portion of the revenue we earn from our intercarrier messaging service is based on a revenue-sharing arrangement with one service partner. Our next-generation AI-based mobile messaging platform, Kontxt, evaluates message streams sent from an application to a person (A2P) and classifies those messages into various categories allowing network operators and other service providers to create policies for prioritization and delivery of messages and blocking spam and fraudulent messages, resulting in more efficient text message delivery. 
Our ringback tone services enable callers to hear subscriber-selected music or messages instead of the traditional electronic ringing sound while waiting for the person they have called to answer. We primarily offer ringback tone services via mobile carriers, where, in return for providing, operating and managing the ringback tone service for the carrier customers, we generally enter into revenue-sharing arrangements with the carriers based on monthly subscription fees, content download fees or a combination of such fees paid by subscribers. 
Our photo and video sharing platform, RealTimes, is offered to wireless carriers for integration in their hosted cloud solutions. Within our Mobile Services group, we focus on leveraging current and prospective wireless carrier relationships to increase integration of the RealTimes platform.
Our computer vision platform, SAFR, detects faces and other types of objects by leveraging AI-based machine learning. We continue to invest in and build industry partnerships for SAFR, typically licensing it to technology partners and system integrators through third-party resellers and directly to end customers. Our SAFR platform is a key investment initiative for us.
 Games
Our Games segment is focused on the development, publishing, and distribution of casual games, which are offered via mobile devices, digital downloads, and subscription play. Casual games typically have simple graphics, rules and controls, are quick to learn, and often include time-management, board, card, puzzle, word and hidden-object games. Our primary focus is our free-to-play mobile games, most notably our Delicious Bed and Breakfast and our Delicious World games. These free-to-play games generate revenue from player purchases of in-game goods and from advertising displayed to consumers during play. 
Our mobile games are digitally distributed through third-party application storefronts, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play, and are principally offered in North America, Europe and Latin America. Historically, we have also offered premium games that we typically introduce to consumers upon release on a free-trial basis. After reaching a certain level of game play, consumers then have the option of purchasing the full game. Although games previously offered for individual purchase will continue to be available, during 2019, we began to shift our strategy to free-to-play games and away from premium mobile games.
PC consumers can access and play both our Original Stories and hundreds of third-party games through individual purchases or a subscription service offered through our GameHouse and Zylom websites, and through websites owned or 
managed by third parties. Consistent with our mobile offerings, we have historically introduced new games by offering a free trial before purchase on an individual-game basis or as part of one of our subscription services. 
 See Note 18. Segment Information, in this 10-K for additional details on our segments and geographic concentrations.
Customers 
Our customers include consumers and businesses located throughout the world. Sales to customers outside the U.S., primarily in Europe and Asia, were 36% and 40% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 18. Segment Information, for details on geographic concentrations, and see Note 6. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable and Sales Returns, for details on customer revenue concentrations.
Research and Development
We devote a substantial portion of our resources to developing new products, enhancing existing products, expanding and improving our fundamental technology, and strengthening our technological expertise in all our businesses. 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Our marketing programs are aimed at increasing brand awareness of our products and services and stimulating demand. We use a variety of methods to market our products and services, including paid search advertising, affiliate marketing programs, electronic and other online media, and email offers to qualified potential and existing customers, and providing product specific information through our websites. We also cross-market products and services offered by some of our businesses through the RealPlayer and Games marketing and distribution channels. We have subsidiaries and offices in several countries that market and sell our products outside the U.S.
Our products and services are marketed through direct and indirect channels. We use public relations, trade shows, events and speaking opportunities to market our products and services. We also use a variety of online channels, including social media, to promote and sell our products and services directly.
In our Consumer Media business, we market and sell our various RealPlayer services directly through our own websites such as Real.com, as well as indirectly through third party distribution partners. We also employ a sales team in China which works with distribution partners on marketing our codec technologies. 
Our Mobile Services sales, marketing and business development teams works closely with many of our enterprise, infrastructure, wireless, broadband, media and governmental customers to identify new business opportunities for our entertainment applications, services and systems. Through ongoing communications with the product and marketing divisions of our customers, we tailor our SaaS offerings to their strategic needs and the needs of their subscribers. 
In our Games business, we market directly from our GameHouse and Zylom websites and through third-party distribution channels, such as application storefronts, search engines, online portals, and content publishers.
Customer Support
Customer support is integral to the provision of nearly all of our consumer products and services. Consumers who purchase and use our consumer software products and services can get assistance primarily via the Internet or email, depending on the product or service. For some of our consumer products, we contract with third-party outsource support vendors to provide the primary staffing for our first-tier customer support globally. We also provide various support service options for our business customers and for software developers using our software products and associated services. Support service options include online support services and on-site support personnel covering technical and business-related support topics.
Competition
The market for software and services for digital media delivery over the Internet and wireless networks is intensely competitive. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition or brand awareness, more employees or significantly greater resources than we do.
In our Consumer Media segment, our codec technology faces competition from other next-generation video codecs, and many of our competitors have come together in patent pools to market and license a shared codec solution that competes with our own codecs. This coalition of multiple companies, which include some of the largest global technology companies, benefits from a significant inherent market penetration and, thus, a substantial competitive advantage over us. In addition, our RealPlayer media player continues to face competition from alternative streaming media playback applications that have obtained very broad market penetration. 
In our Mobile Services segment, our SaaS business competes with a large and diverse number of domestic and international companies, and each of our SaaS offerings tends to face competitors specific to that product or service. Our SaaS 
business continues to experience significant competitive pricing pressure from carriers and the proliferation of smartphone applications and services, some of which do not depend on our carrier customers for distribution to consumers. Many of our SaaS services require a high degree of integration with carrier or service provider networks and thus require a high degree of operational expertise. Our ability to enhance services with new features as the digital entertainment market evolves is critical to our competitive position, as is our knowledge of the consumer environment to which these services are targeted. Also within our Mobile Services segment, our computer vision SAFR platform competes with a wide variety of companies, including small startups and well established, heavily resourced global companies. These competitors continue to develop technologies and launch products in the artificial intelligence and facial recognition markets.
Our Games business competes with a variety of distributors and publishers of casual games for PC and mobile platforms. Our in-house game development studios compete with other developers and publishers of mobile games based on our ability to create high quality games that resonate with consumers, and our ability to secure broad distribution.
Intellectual Property
We maintain patents in the U.S. and other jurisdictions relating to various aspects of our technology. We regularly analyze our patent portfolio and prepare additional patent applications on current and anticipated features of our technology, or sell or abandon patents or applications that are no longer relevant or valuable to our operations.
In addition to our patent portfolio, we have assembled, over time, an international portfolio of trademarks and service marks that covers certain of our products and services. We also have applications pending for additional trademarks and service marks in jurisdictions around the world, and have several unregistered trademarks. Many of our marks begin with the word “Real” (such as RealPlayer). We are aware of other companies that use “Real” in their marks alone or in combination with other words, and we do not expect to be able to prevent all third-party uses of the word “Real” for all goods and services.
Our ability to compete across our businesses partly depends on the superiority, uniqueness and value of the technology that we both develop and license from third parties. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. These efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our technology, or may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those we develop.
Human Capital
Recognizing that our employees are the company’s most meaningful asset, RealNetworks is committed to employing great people, treating each other with respect, and strictly adhering to the highest ethical and legal principles in its business activities. Each of our business units – Mobile Services, Consumer Media, and Games – have unique brands and products tied together by a workforce that is focused on excellence and on providing industry-leading technologies, applications, and products. This structure strongly informs our corporate culture: We strive to run a lean, agile organization that prioritizes innovation in all facets of our work.
Guiding Management Principles
Part of the fabric of the organization and key to the operation of a performance-based environment are our management principles including commitment to innovation, delivering results, raising the bar in all facets of our work, being inclusive and respectful, being great teammates for each other, and embracing the journey by working hard and celebrating our successes. We consider our workforce a significant competitive advantage and actively seek opportunities to reinforce behaviors that exemplify our management principles. We celebrate employees whose work and actions reflect and embody our management principles with company-wide acknowledgment and awards. 
Respectful and Safe Workplace
We want RealNetworks to be a workplace that is open, respectful and safe. RealNetworks encourages and expects the individual actions of its employees at all levels to be consistent with our commitment to a respectful workplace including annual reconfirmation of individual employees’ adherence to our Global Code of Conduct and Ethics. RealNetworks has been and will continue to be fully committed to providing a work environment free from unlawful discrimination or harassment. Our global policies include prohibition of harassment, threatened or actual workplace violence, or any conduct that undermines an employee’s integrity or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment even if it does not rise to the level of illegal harassment under the law. 
RealNetworks is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all employees in compliance with occupational health, safety, and environmental laws. To accomplish this, RealNetworks and its employees adhere to work practices that will prevent accidents, injuries, and illnesses. We consider safety and health issues to be the responsibility of every employee of RealNetworks and we strive to maintain a preventative and cooperative attitude relating to safety issues. 
We have had a heightened focus on the safety of our employees and their families during the COVID-19 pandemic. In early March 2020, we quickly pivoted to a predominantly remote workforce and restricted employee travel. We have since followed guidance from local health experts to ensure our staff across the globe remain safe. We helped our employees with home office set up and added new system applications to foster virtual collaboration. We have also implemented mitigation practices in all offices to ensure employees are safe when on-site. We will continue to prioritize the well-being of our employees as the pandemic continues.
Compensation and Benefits
We operate in a highly competitive, global, and technologically challenging environment. We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs for our employees. In addition to market competitive salaries, we offer additional compensation in the forms of bonuses and stock, which will vary based on job level and location. 
Our U.S. benefit programs include a 401(k) plan with employer matching, medical, dental and vision insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, group and voluntary life and disability insurance, business/travel and accident coverage, subsidized transit programs, paid time off, paid family leave including bonding time for new parents, financial literacy programs, and employee assistance programs. Our benefit programs in our international locations are tailored to local practices and compliant with local labor laws.
Talent Acquisition and Retention
RealNetworks strives to attract and retain a highly skilled, highly talented, and diverse work force. We recognize that we operate in a highly competitive, globally diverse marketplace when it comes to finding top talent. As a result, talent acquisition and the retention of employees continue to be a priority initiative for RealNetworks, and the Company complies with all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which RealNetworks operates. All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or protected veteran status.
In 2020, we implemented an Affirmative Action Plan, or AAP, as required by our new U.S. government contractor status. As part of our AAP, we will conduct annual internal reporting and auditing to ensure we are providing equal employment and pay opportunities for all applicants and existing employees. Equally important, we hope that this regular focus on the diversity of our U.S. workforce will make for a more dynamic culture and inclusive workplace.
RealNetworks maintains a global, ongoing performance review program, and encourages mentoring, stretch assignments, and other opportunities for internal career and occupational growth. Our median employee tenure is just over 5 years. We have a long-demonstrated history of employee advancement and promotion from within the organization. We also provide a variety of tools and methods for employees to provide feedback to managers and company leadership including global and local town hall forums, employee surveys, performance review discussions, and anonymous reporting tools.
Corporate Giving
RealNetworks has a strong history of giving back to the community. In 2000, the Company created the RealNetworks Foundation, which in recent years has generally made two annual grants to multiple charities, totaling about $1 million in annual charitable grants. The Foundation also makes ad hoc, emergency grants when deemed needed to support an urgent issue in the community. In 2020, our Foundation donated $500,000 to charities supporting racial justice and $500,000 to charities supporting COVID-19 relief. In addition, the Foundation's matching program supports the dollars and time that RealNetworks employees devote to eligible 501(c)(3) nonprofits.
RealNetworks also regularly supports participation by employees in activities of service to our local communities, including Day of Caring, local food drives and holiday toy and gift donations. 
Employees
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 325 employees, of which 101 were based in the Americas, 59 were based in Asia, and 165 were based in Europe. The number of our employees represented by unions is not significant.
