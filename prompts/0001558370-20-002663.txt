     ITEM 1.BUSINESS 
     GENERAL
     The Company is the holding company for Essex Bank (the “Bank”), a Virginia state bank with 24 full-service offices in Virginia and Maryland. The Bank also operates two loan production offices in Virginia. 
     The Bank was established in 1926. The Bank engages in a general commercial banking business and provides a wide range of financial services primarily to individuals, small businesses and larger commercial companies, including individual and commercial demand and time deposit accounts, commercial and industrial loans, consumer and small business loans, real estate and mortgage loans, investment services, on-line and mobile banking products, and cash management services.
     Essex Services, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank. Essex Services and its financial consultants offer a broad range of investment products and alternatives through an affiliation with Infinex Investments, Inc., an independent broker-dealer.  It also offers insurance products through the Bank’s ownership interest in Bankers Insurance, LLC, an independent insurance agency.
     The Company’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “ESXB”. 
     STRATEGY
     The Company operates in some of the strongest growth markets in Virginia and Maryland.  Its operating strategy has been to provide the products and services of the larger financial institutions, but delivered with the individual service focus of a small community bank.  This strategy has allowed the Company to have organic growth in its core markets.
     The Company’s markets are geographically diverse enough to spread economic risk throughout a number of different customer bases.  Operating under the individual community delivery philosophy, the Company seeks to enhance customer relationships through superior products delivered with extraordinary service, while maintaining a prudent approach to credit quality and risk controls.  The Company’s associates are the most important element in its strategy for success, and therefore there is significant focus on training and building a team-oriented environment.  In a constantly changing world, competition remains intense among community banks.  One of the features that sets the Company apart from other organizations is the ability and desire to give superior personal service to customers.  
     The Company continues to expand on its internal “Growing to Win” campaign and engage its associates to determine and reflect on the core values that the Company wants to deliver to associates, customers and shareholders.  The Company’s mission statement is “To provide financial inspiration through intriguingly unique experiences that educate and empower action”.  What makes the Company intriguingly unique is the consistent delivery of core values to the customers and the communities of which it is a part.  The Company believes that this strategy not only gives a competitive advantage over larger banks, but also over web-based financial technology companies.
     Building a strong and cohesive culture for the Company is a primary objective of management. The Company’s strategic focus on offering a broad array of products delivered with individual service has resulted in expanded market presence, earnings growth and increased value for shareholders.  Since this strategy has been historically successful, management believes that it will continue to provide solid results.  Additionally, the Company has been focused on controlling risks and allowing growth in a safe and sound manner.  The Company continues to build the capital strength and growth capacities to execute its strategies to create superior value for shareholders.
     OPERATIONS
     The Company’s operating strategy is delineated by business lines and by the functional support areas that help accomplish the stated goals and financial budget of the organization. A major component of future income is growth in 

 
  3
 
three core business lines – retail and business banking, commercial and industrial banking and real estate lending. These core businesses, combined with the Company’s geographic locations, dictate the market position that the Company needs to take to be successful. The majority of new loan growth will occur in all three lines, although the retail segment primarily provides the funding through core deposit relationship growth.
     Retail and Business Banking 
     The Company markets to consumers in geographic areas around its branch network not only through existing bricks and mortar, but also with alternative delivery mechanisms and new product development such as online banking, remote deposit capture, mobile banking and telephonic banking. In addition, the Company attracts new customers by making its service through these distribution points convenient. All of the Company’s existing markets are prime targets for expanding the consumer side of its business with full loan and deposit relationships, and the Company has restructured its retail group to accommodate growth.      Commercial and Industrial Banking 
     In the commercial and industrial banking group, the Company focuses on small to mid-sized business customers (sales of $5 million to $15 million each year) who are not targeted by larger banks and for whom smaller community banks have limited expertise. The Company has an experienced team with a strong loan pipeline. The typical relationship consists of working capital lines and equipment loans with the primary deposit accounts of the customer. Many of these relationships will be new to the Company and create strong and positive growth potential.      Commercial Real Estate Lending 
     The Company has historically held a significant concentration in real estate loans. The current strategy is to manage the existing real estate portfolio and add income producing property loans and builders and other development loans to the portfolio. The Company originates both owner occupied and non-owner occupied borrowings where the cash flows provide significant debt coverage for the relationship.      COMPETITION
     Within its market areas in Virginia and Maryland, the Company operates in a highly competitive environment, competing for deposits and loans with commercial corporations, savings banks and other financial institutions, including non-bank competitors such as financial technology companies, many of which possess substantially greater financial resources than those available to the Company. Many of these institutions have significantly higher lending limits than the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that other financial institutions, with substantially greater resources than the Company, will not establish operations in its service area. The financial services industry remains highly competitive and is constantly evolving. 
     The activities in which the Company engages are highly competitive. Financial institutions such as credit unions, consumer finance companies, financial technology companies, insurance companies, brokerage companies and other financial institutions with varying degrees of regulatory restrictions compete vigorously for a share of the financial services market. Brokerage and insurance companies continue to become more competitive in the financial services arena and pose an ever increasing challenge to banks. Legislative changes also greatly affect the level of competition that the Company faces. Federal legislation allows credit unions to use their expanded membership capabilities, combined with tax-free status, to compete more fiercely for traditional bank business. The tax-free status granted to credit unions provides them a significant competitive advantage. Many of the largest banks operating in Virginia and Maryland, including some of the largest banks in the country, have offices in the Company’s market areas. Many of these institutions have capital resources, broader geographic markets, and legal lending limits substantially in excess of those available to the Company.  The Company faces competition from institutions that offer products and services that it does not or cannot currently offer. Some institutions with which the Company competes offer interest rate levels on loan and deposit products that the Company is unwilling to offer due to interest rate risk and overall profitability concerns. The Company expects the level of competition to increase.

 Factors such as rates offered on loan and deposit products, types of products offered, and the number and location of branch offices, as well as the reputation of institutions in the market, affect competition for loans and deposits. The Company emphasizes customer service, establishing long-term relationships with its customers, thereby creating customer loyalty, and providing adequate product lines for individuals and small to medium-sized business customers. 
     The Company would not be materially or adversely impacted by the loss of a single customer. The Company is not dependent upon a single or a few customers.
     EMPLOYEES 
     As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 243 full-time equivalent employees, including executive officers, loan and other banking officers, branch personnel, operations personnel and other support personnel. None of the Company’s employees is represented by a union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. Management of the Company considers its employee relations to be excellent.

     SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
     General 
     Bank holding companies, banks and their affiliates are extensively regulated under both federal and state law.  The following summary discusses certain provisions of federal and state laws and certain regulations and the potential impact of such provisions on the Company and the Bank. These federal and state laws and regulations have been enacted generally for the protection of depositors in banks and not for the protection of shareholders of bank holding companies or banks.  This summary is not complete, and we refer you to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals for more information     The Company
     As a bank holding company, we are subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”).  Under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or ownership constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.  The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) have adopted guidelines and released interpretative materials that establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safe and sound operation of banks and bank holding companies.  These standards relate to the institution’s key operating functions, including but not limited to capital management, internal controls, internal audit systems, information systems, data and cybersecurity, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure and risk management, vendor management, executive management and its compensation, corporate governance, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, liquidity and risk management.

 The BHCA generally limits the activities of a bank holding company and its subsidiaries to that of banking, managing or controlling banks, or any other activity that is so closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident to it. While federal law permits bank holding companies from any state to acquire banks and bank holding companies located in any other state, or to establish interstate de novo branches, the Federal Reserve has jurisdiction under the BHCA to approve any bank or non-bank acquisition, merger or consolidation, or the establishment of any interstate de novo branches, proposed by a bank holding company. 
     There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositor of such depository institutions and to the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default or in default. For example, under a policy of the Federal Reserve with respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so otherwise. 
     The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”) also provides that amounts received from the liquidation or other resolution of any insured depository institution by any receiver must be distributed (after payment of secured claims) to pay the deposit liabilities of the institution prior to payment of any other general or unsecured senior liability, subordinated liability, general creditor or shareholders in the event that a receiver is appointed to distribute the assets of the Bank. 
     The Company is also subject to regulation and supervision by the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the “Bureau”) under the financial institution holding company laws of Virginia.
     The Bank
     The Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Bureau and its primary federal regulator, the FDIC. The various laws and regulations issued and administered by the regulatory agencies affect corporate practices, such as the payment of dividends, the incurrence of debt and the acquisition of financial institutions and other companies, and affect business practices and operations, such as the payment of interest on deposits, the charging of interest on loans, the types of business conducted, the products and terms offered to customers and the location of offices. Prior approval of the applicable primary federal regulator and the Bureau is required for a Virginia chartered bank or bank holding company to merge with another bank or bank holding company, to purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank or bank holding company, or to acquire control of another bank or bank holding company. 
     The Dodd-Frank Act and the EGRRCPA
     The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) has significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the United States and has had a broad impact on the financial services industry.
     The Dodd-Frank Act implemented far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including changes that have significantly affected the business of all bank holding companies and banks, including the Company and the Bank.  Some of the rules that have been proposed and, in some cases, adopted to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act's mandates are discussed further below. In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”) was enacted to reduce the regulatory burden on certain banking organizations, including community banks, by modifying or eliminating certain federal regulatory requirements. While the EGRRCPA maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion as well as for larger banks with assets above $50 billion. In addition, the EGRRCPA included regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, application of the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures, qualified mortgages, and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans. However, federal banking regulators retain broad discretion to impose additional regulatory requirements on banking organizations based on safety and soundness and U.S. financial system stability considerations.

     The Company continues to experience ongoing regulatory reform. These regulatory changes could have a significant effect on how the Company conducts its business. The specific implications of the Dodd-Frank Act, the EGRRCPA, and other potential regulatory reforms cannot yet be fully predicted and will depend to a large extent on the specific regulations that are to be adopted in the future.  Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and the EGRRCPA are discussed in more detail below. 
     Capital Requirements 
     Basel III Capital Framework. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted rules to implement the Basel III capital framework as outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and standards for calculating risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital measurements (collectively, the “Basel III Final Rules”) that apply to banking institutions they supervise. For the purposes of these capital rules, (i) common equity tier 1 capital (“CET1”) consists principally of common stock (including surplus) and retained earnings; (ii) Tier 1 capital consists principally of CET1 plus non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, and certain grandfathered cumulative preferred stocks and trust preferred securities; and (iii) Tier 2 capital consists of other capital instruments, principally qualifying subordinated debt and preferred stock, and limited amounts of an institution’s allowance for loan losses. Each regulatory capital classification is subject to certain adjustments and limitations, as implemented by the Basel III Final Rules. The Basel III Final Rules also establish risk weightings that are applied to many classes of assets held by community banks, importantly including applying higher risk weightings to certain commercial real estate loans. 
      The Basel III Final Rules and minimum capital ratios required to be maintained by banks were effective January 1, 2015. The Basel III Final Rules also include a requirement that banks maintain additional capital (the “capital conservation buffer”), which was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 and was fully phased in effective January 1, 2019. The Basel III Final Rules and fully phased in capital conservation buffer require banks to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 percent, plus a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer (which is added to the minimum CET1 ratio, effectively resulting in a required ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7 percent), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 percent, plus the capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a required Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 percent), (iii) a minimum ratio of total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 percent, plus the capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a required total capital ratio of 10.5 percent) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets, subject to certain adjustments and limitations. 
 The Basel III Final Rules provide deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital measures, primarily to CET1, including deductions and adjustments that were not applied to reduce CET1 under historical regulatory capital rules. For example, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income, and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 percent of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 percent of CET1. 
      Community Bank Leverage Ratio. As a result of the EGRRCPA, the federal banking agencies were required to develop a Community Bank Leverage Ratio (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for banking organizations with assets of less than $10 billion, such as the Bank. On October 29, 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that implements the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework (the “CBLRF”).  To qualify for the CBLRF, a bank must have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities, and a leverage ratio greater than 9 percent. A bank that elects the CBLRF and has a leverage ratio greater than 9 percent will be considered to be in compliance with Basel III capital requirements and exempt from the complex Basel III calculations and will also be deemed “well capitalized” under Prompt Corrective Action regulations, discussed below.  A bank that falls out of compliance with the CBLRF will have a two-quarter grace period to come back into full compliance, provided its leverage ratio remains above 8 percent (a bank will be deemed “well capitalized” during the grace period).  The CBLRF will be available for banking organizations to use as of March 31, 2020 (with the flexibility for banking organizations to subsequently opt into or out of the CBLRF, as applicable).  
      Small Bank Holding Company. The EGRRCPA also expanded the category of bank holding companies that may rely on the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement by raising the maximum amount of 

 
  7
 
assets a qualifying bank holding company may have from $1 billion to $3 billion. In addition to meeting the asset threshold, a bank holding company must not engage in significant nonbanking activities, not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities, and not have a material amount of debt or equity securities outstanding and registered with the SEC (subject to certain exceptions). The Federal Reserve may, in its discretion, exclude any bank holding company from the application of the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement if such action is warranted for supervisory purposes. 
      In August 2018, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule to apply the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement to bank holding companies with consolidated total assets of less than $3 billion. The policy statement, which, among other things, exempts certain bank holding companies from minimum consolidated regulatory capital ratios that apply to other bank holding companies. As a result of the interim final rule, which was effective August 30, 2018, the Company expects that it will be treated as a small bank holding company and will not be subject to regulatory capital requirements. The comment period on the interim final rule closed on October 29, 2018 and, to date, the Federal Reserve has not issued a final rule to replace the interim final rule. The Bank remains subject to the regulatory capital requirements described above. 
     Dividends 
     The Company is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from the Bank.  The Company’s ability to distribute cash dividends will depend primarily on the ability of its banking subsidiary to pay dividends to it. The Bank is subject to legal limitations on the amount of dividends that it is permitted to pay under Section 5199(b) of the Revised Statues (12 U.S.C. 60), and the approval of the Federal Reserve would be required if the total of all dividends declared by a state member bank in any calendar year shall exceed the total of its net profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years.  Additionally, the Bank is further restricted by Regulation H, Section 208.5, Dividends and Other Distributions, which requires pre-approval of dividends that exceed undivided profits. Furthermore, neither the Company nor the Bank may declare or pay a cash dividend on any of its capital stock if it is insolvent or if the payment of the dividend would render the entity insolvent or unable to pay its obligations as they become due in the ordinary course of business.
     Bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank or the Company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its respective business. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, or the Company, could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice.
     Under the FDIA, insured depository institutions such as the Bank, are prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distributions, the institution would become “undercapitalized” (as such term is used in the statute). Based on the Bank’s current financial condition, the Company does not expect that this provision will have any impact on its ability to receive dividends from the Bank. 
     Deposit Insurance 
     The Bank’s deposits are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the standard maximum insurance amount for each deposit insurance ownership category. The basic limit on FDIC deposit insurance coverage is $250,000 per depositor. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations as an insured institution, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC, subject to administrative and potential judicial hearing and review processes. 
      The DIF is funded by assessments on banks and other depository institutions calculated based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital). As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted a large-bank pricing assessment scheme, set a target “designated reserve ratio” (described in more detail below) of 2 percent for the DIF and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower assessment rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2 percent and 2.5 percent. An institution's assessment rate is based on a statistical analysis of financial ratios that estimates the likelihood of failure over a three-year period, which considers the institution’s weighted average CAMELS component rating, and is subject to further adjustments including those related to levels of 

 
  8
 
unsecured debt and brokered deposits (not applicable to banks with less than $10 billion in assets).  At December 31, 2019, total base assessment rates for institutions that have been insured for at least five years range from 1.5 to 30 basis points applying to banks with less than $10 billion in assets. 
      The Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the FDIC increased discretion with regard to managing the required amount of reserves for the DIF, or the “designated reserve ratio.” The FDIA requires that the FDIC consider the appropriate level for the designated reserve ratio on at least an annual basis. As of December 31, 2019, the designated reserve ratio was 2.00 percent and the minimum designated reserve ratio was 1.35 percent. 
      Banks with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets are eligible for credits to offset the portion of their assessments that helped to raise the reserve ratio to 1.35 percent. The FDIC automatically applies these credits to reduce an eligible bank’s regular DIF assessment up to the entire amount of the assessment.  The FDIC will remit any such remaining credits in a lump sum to the appropriate bank following application to the bank’s regular DIF assessment for four quarterly assessment periods. The Bank was awarded credits of $365,000, of which $207,000 was used to offset its DIF assessment in the third and fourth quarters of 2019.  The Company expects that the remainder of the credits will be utilized to offset the Bank’s DIF assessment during 2020. 
     Consumer Laws and Regulations
     The Bank is subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth-in-Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act, and regulations issued under such acts, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such customers.
     The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining, and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB focuses on (i) risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws, (ii) the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets, (iii) depository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services, and (iv) non-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services.
     The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction.
     Community Reinvestment Act 
     The Bank is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”), which imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with their safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of entire communities where the bank accepts deposits, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the Bank’s CRA record is made available to the public. Further, a less than satisfactory CRA rating will slow, if not preclude, expansion of banking activities and prevent a company from becoming or remaining a financial holding company. Federal CRA regulations require, among other things, that evidence of discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis, and illegal or abusive lending practices be considered in the CRA evaluation. The Bank has a rating of “Satisfactory” in its most recent CRA evaluation.

 Cybersecurity
     The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of a financial institution’s board of directors. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial products and services. The federal banking agencies expect financial institutions to establish lines of defense and ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, and also expect financial institutions to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack. If the Company or the Bank fails to meet the expectations set forth in this regulatory guidance, the Company or the Bank could be subject to various regulatory actions and any remediation efforts may require significant resources of the Company or the Bank.  In addition, all federal and state bank regulatory agencies continue to increase focus on cybersecurity programs and risks as part of regular supervisory exams. 
     In October 2016, the federal banking agencies issued proposed rules on enhanced cybersecurity risk-management and resilience standards that would apply to very large financial institutions and to services provided by third parties to these institutions. The comment period for these proposed rules has closed and a final rule has not been published. Although the proposed rules would apply only to bank holding companies and banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, these rules could influence the federal banking agencies’ expectations and supervisory requirements for information security standards and cybersecurity programs of smaller financial institutions, such as the Company and the Bank. 
     Incentive Compensation
     The federal banking agencies have issued regulatory guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” The findings will be included in reports of examination, and deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 
      In 2016, the SEC and the federal banking agencies proposed rules that prohibit covered financial institutions (including bank holding companies and banks) from establishing or maintaining incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing covered persons (consisting of senior executive officers and significant risk takers, as defined in the rules) with excessive compensation, fees or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the financial institution.  The proposed rules outline factors to be considered when analyzing whether compensation is excessive and whether an incentive-based compensation arrangement encourages inappropriate risks that could lead to material loss to the covered financial institution, and establishes minimum requirements that incentive-based compensation arrangements must meet to be considered to not encourage inappropriate risks and to appropriately balance risk and reward.  The proposed rules also impose additional corporate governance requirements on the boards of directors of covered financial institutions and impose additional record-keeping requirements.  The comment period for these proposed rules has closed and a final rule has not yet been published.   
     Prompt Corrective Action
     The federal banking agencies have broad powers under current federal law to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” These terms are defined under uniform regulations issued by each of the federal banking agencies regulating these institutions. An insured depository institution which is less than adequately capitalized must 

 
  10
 
adopt an acceptable capital restoration plan, is subject to increased regulatory oversight and is increasingly restricted in the scope of its permissible activities. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank was considered “well capitalized.” 
     Governmental Policies 
     The Federal Reserve regulates money, credit and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions. These policies influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits. These policies also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for time and savings deposits. Federal Reserve monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.      Future Regulations
     From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company and the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company or the Bank.
