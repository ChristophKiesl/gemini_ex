ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Background
 
We were incorporated in Colorado on January 16, 2002. In April 2012, we became active in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties.
 
Effective September 2, 2016, we formally changed our name to Petrolia Energy Corporation and moved the corporation from Colorado to Texas, pursuant to the filing of a Statement of Conversion with the Secretary of State of Colorado and a Certificate of Conversion with the Secretary of State of Texas, authorized by the Plan of Conversion which was approved by our stockholders at our April 14, 2016, annual meeting of stockholders, each of which are described in greater detail in the Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 23, 2016. In addition to the Certificate of Conversion filing, we filed a Certificate of Correction filing with the Secretary of State of Texas (correcting certain errors in our originally filed Certificate of Formation) on August 24, 2016.
Plan of Operation
 
Since 2015, we have established a strategy to acquire, enhance and redevelop high-quality, resource in place assets. As of 2018, the Company has been focusing on strategic acquisitions in western Canada while actively pursuing the strategy to execute low-cost operational solutions, and affordable technology. We believe our conventional, low-risk resource plays and the redevelopment of our late-stage plays is a solid foundation for continued oil production growth and future revenue growth.


Our strategy is to acquire and operate low risk, conventionally producing oil fields. This strategy allows us to incorporate new technology to minimize risk and maximize the recoverability of existing reservoirs. This approach allows us to reduce the environmental impact caused by exploratory development.
 
Our growth related activities will primarily be dependent upon oil prices and available financing.
 
Oil and gas leases are considered real property. Title to properties which we may acquire will be subject to landowner’s royalties, overriding royalties, carried working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, to liens for current taxes not yet due, liens for amounts owing to persons operating wells, and other encumbrances. As is customary in the industry, in the case of undeveloped properties, little investigation of record title will be made at the time of acquisition (other than a preliminary review of local records). However, drilling title opinions may be obtained before commencement of drilling operations.

Slick Unit Dutcher Sands (“SUDS”) Field
 
The SUDS oilfield consists of 2,604 acres located in Creek County, Oklahoma and Petrolia owns a 100% Working Interest (“WI”) with a 76.5% net revenue interest (NRI). The first oil well was completed in 1918 by Standard Oil of Ohio (“Sohio”), which at that time was owned by John D. Rockefeller. By 1959, approximately 14,000,000 barrels of oil had been recovered at an average well depth of 3,100 feet and over 100 wells in production. Our engineering reports and analysis indicate there is still considerable recoverable reserves remaining.
 
We have recently completed a capital project to rebuild our field tank battery, consisting of two free water knockout units, four oil stock tanks and one fiberglass saltwater tank. Additionally, we received a new 5-year permit for our disposal well and upgraded our flowlines for most of the field.
 
Twin Lakes San Andres Unit (“TLSAU”) Field
 
TLSAU is located 45 miles from Roswell, Chaves County, New Mexico and consists of 3,864 acres with 58 wells. The last independent reserve report prepared by MKM Engineering on December 31, 2019, reflects approximately 752,000 barrels of proven oil reserves remaining for the 100% working interest.
 
TLSAU is currently shut-in awaiting capital allocation to complete some regulatory plugging requirements and well workovers.
 
Askarii Resources, LLC
 
Effective February 1, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding interests of Askarii Resources LLC (“Askarii”), a private Texas based oil & gas service company for the aggregate value of $50,000.
 
The Company plans to engage in the oil field service business in the U.S. and Canada while researching various enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technologies and methods which it can use for the benefit of the Company’s oil fields.
 
Bow Energy Ltd., a related party
 
On February 27, 2018, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares in Bow Energy Ltd., which has contracts covering a total land position in Indonesia of 948,029 net acres, as described in greater detail below.
 
On August 31, 2018, the Company entered into and closed the transactions contemplated by a Share Exchange Agreement with Blue Sky Resources Ltd. (“Blue Sky” and the “Exchange Agreement”) to sell Bow Energy Ltd while retaining a 20% interest in Bow’s subsidiary, Bow Energy International Holdings Inc. (“BEIH”). The Chief Executive Officer of Blue Sky is Ilyas Chaudhary, the father of Zel C. Khan, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.

The acquisition of Bow in February 2018 and the disposition of Bow in September 2018 are each discussed in greater detail in “Note 4. Acquisition of Bow Energy Ltd., a Related Party” and “Note 5. Disposition of Bow Energy Ltd., a Related Party”, in the consolidated audited financial statements included herein.
 
In connection with the closing of the Exchange Agreement, the Company cancelled shares of common stock previously held by Blue Sky (and affiliates) and returned such shares to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. The 70,807,417 shares returned to treasury were subsequently cancelled including any outstanding warrants.
 
Canadian properties – Luseland, Hearts Hill and Cuthbert fields
 
On June 29, 2018, the Company acquired a 25% working interest in approximately 41,526 acres located in the Luseland, Hearts Hill, and Cuthbert fields, located in Southwest Saskatchewan and Eastern Alberta, Canada (collectively, the “Canadian Properties” and the “Working Interest”). The Canadian Properties currently encompass 64 sections, with 240 oil and 12 natural gas wells currently producing on the properties. Additionally, there are several idle wells with potential for reactivation and 34 sections of undeveloped land (approximately 21,760 acres). The Canadian Properties and the Working Interest were acquired from Blue Sky (a related party, as described above). Blue Sky had previously acquired an 80% working interest from Georox Resources Inc., who had acquired the Canadian Properties from Cona Resources Ltd.
 
On September 17, 2018, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with Blue Sky to obtain the rights to acquire an additional 3% working interest in the Canadian Properties, increasing our Working Interest to 28%. Total consideration paid from the Company to Blue Sky for the additional 3% Working Interest was $150,000. Funding for this additional interest came by borrowing against the LOC with Jovian Petroleum Corporation.
 
The following table shows our producing wells, developed acreage, and undeveloped acreage as of December 31, 2019, for the Oklahoma, New Mexico and Alberta/Saskatchewan properties:
 

State/Province | Productive Wells | | | Developed Acreage | | Undeveloped Acreage (1)

Below are estimates of our cumulative net proved reserves of all fields, as of December 31, 2019, net to our interest. Our proved reserves are located in Oklahoma, New Mexico and Canada.
 
Estimates of volumes of proved reserves at December 31, 2019 are presented in barrels (Bbls) for oil and, for natural gas, in thousands of cubic feet (Mcf) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located.
 

 | Oil (Bbls) | | Gas (Mcf) 
------------+----------------+-----------+--------------
Proved: | | | | 
Developed | | 1,688,437 | | 31,600
Undeveloped | | 112,020 | | — 
Total | | 1,800,457 | | 31,600


● | Bbl - refers to one barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, in reference to crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Mcf - refers to one thousand cubic feet. 
● | A BOE (i.e., barrel of oil equivalent) combines Bbls of oil and Mcf of gas by converting each six Mcf of gas to one Bbl of oil. 

 
Below are estimates of our present value of estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves based upon the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is determined by using estimated quantities of proved reserves and the periods in which they are expected to be developed and produced based on period-end economic conditions. The estimated future production is based upon benchmark prices that reflect the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day-of-the-month price for oil and gas during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019. The resulting estimated future cash inflows are then reduced by estimated future costs to develop and produce reserves based on period-end cost levels. No deduction has been made for depletion, depreciation or for indirect costs, such as general corporate overhead. Present values were computed by discounting future net revenues by 10% per year.
 

Future cash inflows | $ | 95,308,110 | 
---------------------------------------+---+-------------+--
Deductions (including estimated taxes) | $ | (32,401,530 | )
Future net cash flow | $ | 62,906,580 | 
Discounted future net cash flow | $ | 25,824,730 |

MKM Engineering prepared the estimates of our proved reserves, future production and income attributable to our leasehold interests in the United States and Canada as of December 31, 2019. Michele Mudrone was the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the 2019 reserve report. Ms. Mudrone has more than 25 years of practical experience in the estimation and evaluation of petroleum reserves. MKM Engineering is an independent petroleum engineering firm that provides petroleum consulting services to the oil and gas industry. The estimates of drilled reserves, future production and income attributable to certain leasehold and royalty interests are based on technical analysis conducted by engineers employed at MKM Engineering.
 
Zel C. Khan, our CEO, oversaw preparation of the reserve estimates by MKM Engineering. We do not have a reserve committee and we do not have any specific internal controls regarding the estimates of our reserves.
 
Our proved reserves include only those amounts which we reasonably expect to recover in the future from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, at current prices and costs, under existing regulatory practices and with existing technology. Accordingly, any changes in prices, operating and development costs, regulations, technology or other factors could significantly increase or decrease estimates of proved reserves.
 
Proved reserves were estimated by performance methods, the volumetric method, analogy, or a combination of methods utilizing present economic conditions and limited to those proved reserves economically recoverable. The performance methods include decline curve analysis that utilize extrapolations of historical production and pressure data available through December 31, 2019 in those cases where such data was considered to be definitive.
 
Forecasts for future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production in the region with an economic cut-off for production based upon the projected net revenue being equal to the projected operating expenses. No further reserves or valuation were given to any wells beyond their economic cut-off. Where no production decline trends have been established due to the limited historical production records from wells on the properties, surrounding wells historical production records were used and extrapolated to wells of the property. Where applicable, the actual calculated present decline rate of any well was used to determine future production volumes to be economically recovered. The calculated present rate of decline was then used to determine the present economic life of the production from the reservoir.
 
For wells currently on production, forecasts of future production rates were based on historical performance data. If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated. An estimated rate of decline was then applied to economic depletion of the reserves. If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.
 
Proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves were estimated primarily by the performance and historical extrapolation methods. Test data and other related information were used to estimate the anticipated initial production rates from those wells or locations that are not currently producing. For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at a date we determined to be reasonable.
 
In general, the volume of production from our oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities, or both, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. Accordingly, volumes generated from our future activities are highly dependent upon the level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves and the costs incurred in doing so.

Government Regulation
 
Various state, province and federal agencies regulate the production and sale of oil and natural gas. All states and provinces in which we plan to operate impose restrictions on the drilling, production, transportation and sale of oil and natural gas.
 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas. The FERC’s jurisdiction over interstate natural gas sales has been substantially modified by the Natural Gas Policy Act under which the FERC continued to regulate the maximum selling prices of certain categories of gas sold in “first sales” in interstate and intrastate commerce.
 
FERC has pursued policy initiatives that have affected natural gas marketing. Most notable are (1) the large-scale divestiture of interstate pipeline-owned gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non-affiliated companies; (2) further development of rules governing the relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates; (3) the publication of standards relating to the use of electronic bulletin boards and electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make available transaction information on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis; (4) further review of the role of the secondary market for released pipeline capacity and its relationship to open access service in the primary market; and (5) development of policy and promulgation of orders pertaining to its authorization of market-based rates (rather than traditional cost-of-service based rates) for transportation or transportation-related services upon the pipeline’s demonstration of lack of market control in the relevant service market. We do not know what effect the FERC’s other activities will have on the access to markets, the fostering of competition and the cost of doing business.
 
Our sale of oil and natural gas liquids will not be regulated and will be at market prices. The price received from the sale of these products will be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. Much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines.
 
Federal, state, and local agencies have promulgated extensive rules and regulations applicable to our oil and natural gas exploration, production and related operations. Most states require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and the filing of reports concerning operations, and impose other requirements relating to the exploration of oil and natural gas. Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. The statutes and regulations of some states limit the rate at which oil and natural gas is produced from our properties. The federal and state regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because these rules and regulations are amended or reinterpreted frequently, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with those laws.
 
Competition and Marketing
 
We will be faced with strong competition from many other companies and individuals engaged in the oil and gas business, many are very large, well established energy companies with substantial capabilities and established earnings records. We will be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring oil and gas prospects since we must compete with these individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs. It is nearly impossible to estimate the number of competitors; however, it is known that there are a large number of companies and individuals in the oil and gas business.
 
Exploration for and production of oil and gas are affected by the availability of pipe, casing and other tubular goods and certain other oil field equipment including drilling rigs and tools. We will depend upon independent drilling contractors to furnish rigs, equipment and tools to drill our wells. Higher prices for oil and gas may result in competition among operators for drilling equipment, tubular goods and drilling crews which may affect our ability to expeditiously drill, complete, recomplete and work-over wells.
 
The market for oil and gas is dependent upon a number of factors beyond our control, which at times cannot be accurately predicted. These factors include the proximity of wells to, and the capacity of, natural gas pipelines, the extent of competitive domestic production and imports of oil and gas, the availability of other sources of energy, fluctuations in seasonal supply and demand, and governmental regulation. In addition, there is always the possibility that new legislation may be enacted that would impose price controls or additional excise taxes upon crude oil or natural gas, or both. Oversupplies of natural gas can be expected to recur from time to time and may result in the gas producing wells being shut-in. Imports of natural gas may adversely affect the market for domestic natural gas.

The market price for crude oil is significantly affected by policies adopted by the member nations of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”). Members of OPEC establish prices and production quotas among themselves for petroleum products from time to time with the intent of controlling the current global supply and consequently price levels. We are unable to predict the effect, if any, that OPEC or other countries will have on the amount of, or the prices received for, crude oil and natural gas.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2019, we have four (4) full-time employees and no part-time employees. As of May 10, 2021, the Company has (3) three full-time employees an no part-time employees.
