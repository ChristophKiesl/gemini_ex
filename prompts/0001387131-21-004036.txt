Disposition of Business Units
 
   Sale of Pioneer Critical Power, Inc.     
On January 22, 2019, Pioneer Critical Power, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“PCPI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company within the T&D Solutions segment, CleanSpark and CleanSpark Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub merged with and into PCPI, with PCPI becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the CleanSpark and the surviving company of the merger (the “Merger”).
 
At the effective date of the Merger, all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of PCPI, par value $0.01 per share, were converted into the right to receive (i) 175,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“CleanSpark Common Stock”), of CleanSpark, (ii) a five-year warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of CleanSpark Common Stock at an exercise price of $16.00 per share, and (iii) a five-year warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of CleanSpark Common Stock at an exercise price of $20.00 per share. The share quantities and exercise prices of warrants reflect the 10:1 reverse stock split completed by CleanSpark in December 2019.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold all of the CleanSpark Common Stock and warrants to purchase CleanSpark Common Stock it received in connection with the Merger Agreement and recorded proceeds of $2.4 million. The gain from the sale was partially offset by a mark to market adjustment of $1.4 million resulting in a net gain of $968 to other (income) expense in the accompanying statements of operations. Warrants at fair value were previously recorded at inception as long term within other assets.
 
In connection with the Merger Agreement, the Company, CleanSpark and PCPI entered into an Indemnity Agreement (the “Indemnity Agreement”), dated January 22, 2019, pursuant to which the Company agreed to assume the liabilities and obligations related to the claims made by Myers Powers Products, Inc. in the then-pending case titled Myers Power Products, Inc. v. Pioneer Power Solutions, Inc., Pioneer Custom Electrical Products, Corp., et al., Los Angeles County Superior Court Case No. BC606546 (the “Myers Power Case”) as they may relate to PCPI or CleanSpark after the closing of the Merger.
 
In connection with entry into the Merger Agreement, the Company and CleanSpark entered into a Contract Manufacturing Agreement (the “Contract Manufacturing Agreement”), dated as of January 22, 2019, pursuant to which the Company will manufacture paralleling switchgear, automatic transfer switches and related control and circuit protective equipment (collectively, “Products”) exclusively for purchase by CleanSpark. CleanSpark will purchase the Products via purchase orders issued to the Company at any time and from time to time. The price for the Products payable by CleanSpark to the Company will be negotiated on a case by case basis. The Contract Manufacturing Agreement had a term of 18 months and expired during the third quarter of 2020.
 
  2 
 

In connection with entry into the Merger Agreement, the Company and CleanSpark entered into a Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement (the “Non-Compete Agreement”), dated January 22, 2019, pursuant to which the Company agreed not to, among other things, own, manage, operate, finance, control, advise, render services to or guarantee the obligations of any person or entity that engages in or plans to engage in the design, manufacture, distribution and service of paralleling switchgear, automatic transfer switches, and related products (the “Restricted Business”). The Company agreed not to engage in the Restricted Business within any state or county within the United States in which CleanSpark or the surviving company of the Merger conducts such Restricted Business for a period of four (4) years from the date of the Non-Compete Agreement.
 
In addition, the Company also agreed, for a period of four (4) years from the date of the Non-Compete Agreement, not to, among other things, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, induce, or attempt to induce customers, suppliers, licensees, licensors, franchisees, consultants of the Restricted Business as conducted by the Company, CleanSpark or the surviving company to cease doing business with the surviving company or CleanSpark or (ii) solicit, recruit, or encourage any of the surviving company’s or CleanSpark’s employees, or independent contractors to discontinue their employment or engagement with the surviving company or CleanSpark.
 
The Merger resulted in the deconsolidation of PCPI and a gain of $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2019. The fair value of the investment in the CleanSpark Common Stock was determined using quoted market prices, and the fair value of the investment in the warrants was established using a Black Scholes model.
 
The PCPI entity was a dormant business unit at the time of this sale; therefore this sale has no impact to the discontinued operations presented within the financial statements.
 
   Sale of Transformer Business Units     
On June 28, 2019, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company, Electrogroup Canada, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Electrogroup”), Jefferson Electric, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Jefferson”), JE Mexican Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“JE Mexico,” and together with Electrogroup and Jefferson, the “Disposed Companies”), Nathan Mazurek (Chief Executive Officer of the Company), Pioneer Transformers L.P. (the “US Buyer”) and Pioneer Acquireco ULC (the “Canadian Buyer,” and together with the US Buyer, the “Buyer”). Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to sell (i) all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Electrogroup to the Canadian Buyer and (ii) all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Jefferson and JE Mexico to the US Buyer (the “Equity Transaction”), for a purchase price of $68.0 million. Included in the purchase price, the Company received two subordinated promissory notes, issued by the Buyer, in the aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million and $2.5 million, for a total aggregate principal amount of $7.5 million (the “Seller Notes”). During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company and the Buyer, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, completed the net working capital adjustment, which resulted in the Company paying the Buyer $1.8 million in cash and reducing the principal amount of the $5.0 million Seller Note to $3.2 million. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company recognized an additional reduction to the principal amount of the Seller Note of $194 for a valid claim paid by the Buyer on behalf of the Company. Including the reduction to the principal amount for the valid claim, the Company has revalued the Seller Notes for an appropriate imputed interest rate, resulting in a change to the value of the Seller Notes at December 31, 2020 of $254, for a carrying value of $5.3 million, which is included within other long term assets (see Note 11 - Other Assets).
 
The transaction was consummated on August 16, 2019. Pioneer sold to the Buyer all of the assets and liabilities associated with its liquid-filled transformer and dry-type transformer manufacturing businesses within the Company’s T&D Solutions segment. Pioneer Power retained its switchgear manufacturing business within the T&D Solutions segment, as well as all of the operations associated with its Critical Power segment.  
 
For presentation within these statements, the Disposed Companies are being presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

During 2019, the Company completed the sales of the transformer and the PCPI business units. The Company continues to explore strategic alternatives for its remaining business units.
 
We intend to build our revenue and net income at rates exceeding industry norms through internal growth initiatives and complementary acquisitions. Accomplishing these financial goals will be dependent on a number of factors including our ability to execute the following strategies and actions:
 

• | Establishing a scalable organizational infrastructure to support our expected growth;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Investing in our capabilities to provide progressively more advanced equipment and service solutions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuously applying our manufacturing and service resources to their highest and best uses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Combining and streamlining our business unit supply chains and administrative functions; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improving business processes to deliver consistency, quality and value to our customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

T&D Solutions Segment
 
We intend to accomplish our growth objectives within our T&D Solutions business by emphasizing our capabilities in OEM equipment solutions and continuing to invest in engineering resources and product development to increase our pipeline of recurring order customers that demand custom solutions for their power needs.

Additionally, we are actively marketing our refurbished and used generation equipment intended to ensure access to uninterrupted power during times of emergency.
Our Industry
 
The market for T&D equipment and Critical Power solutions is very fragmented due to the range of equipment types, electrical and mechanical properties, technological standards and service parameters required by different categories of end users for their specific applications. Many orders are custom-engineered and tend to be time-sensitive since other critical work is frequently being coordinated around the customer’s electrical equipment installation. The vast majority of North American demand for the types of solutions we provide is satisfied by thousands of producers and service companies in the U.S.
 
We believe several of the key industry trends supporting future growth in our industry are as follows:
 

• | Aging and Overburdened North American Power Grid — The aging and overburdened North American power grid is expected to require significant capital expenditures to upgrade the existing infrastructure over the next several years to maintain adequate levels of reliability and efficiency. Significant capital investment will be required to relieve congestion, meet growing demand, achieve targets for efficiency, emissions and use of renewable sources, and to replace components of the U.S. power grid operating at, near or past their planned service lives. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Increasing Long-Term Demand for Electricity and Reliable Power — The Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration, or EIA, forecasts that total electricity use in the U.S. will increase by approximately 28% from 2011 to 2040. This increase is driven by anticipated population growth, economic expansion, increasing dependence on computing power throughout the economy and the increased use of electrical devices in the home. In order to meet growing demand for electricity in North America, substantial investment in increased electrical grid capacity and efficiency will be required, as well as the addition of specialized equipment to help ensure the reliability and quality of electricity for critical applications. In response to these challenges, there is an increasing trend among commercial and industrial companies to invest in on-site power sources, both for standby purposes in the event of a catastrophic power outage, or to reduce the amount of electricity they draw from the utility grid during peak periods.

• | Rapidly Expanding Electric Vehicle (EV) and Charging Infrastructure Market — A report from Allied Market Research in 2020 projected that the global electric vehicle market will reach $803 billion by the year 2027, registering a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.6%. North America is estimated to reach $194 billion by 2027, at a significant CAGR of 27.5%. In 2010, only about 17,000 electric vehicles were on the world’s roads. By 2019, that number had swelled to 7.2 million and is increasing rapidly according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Furthermore, in order for EV’s to grow at such a rapid pace, it is necessary that infrastructure be built to allow for such growth. In 2019, there were about 7.3 million chargers worldwide compared to an insignificant amount ten years ago, and the EV infrastructure has become a global priority as major governments and corporations have committed to spending billions of dollars towards building EV charging infrastructure. In order to meet the rapidly growing demand for EV’s and the infrastructure supporting it, substantial investment in grid connectivity and enhancement will be required.

Customers
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, 100% of our sales were to U.S. customers, represented in large part by companies involved in distributed generation, regulated and non-regulated utilities and industrial and wholesale business. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold our electrical equipment and services to over 900 individual customers and our twenty largest customers represented approximately 74% of our consolidated revenue.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2019, 100% of our sales were to U.S. customers, represented in large part by companies involved in distributed generation, regulated and non-regulated utilities and industrial and wholesale business. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold our electrical equipment and services to over 900 individual customers and our twenty largest customers represented approximately 75% of our consolidated revenue.
 
Approximately 34% and 18% of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were made to CleanSpark Inc. The majority of our sales to CleanSpark were made pursuant to the Contract Manufacturing Agreement that was entered into as part of the sale of PCPI. The Contract Manufacturing Agreement had a term of 18 months and expired during the third quarter of 2020. We continue to do business with CleanSpark on a case by case arm’s length basis.
 
While the loss of a significant number of customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, we do not believe that the loss of any specific customer, aside from CleanSpark, would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
 
A substantial portion of the products we offer are sold directly to customers by our marketing and sales personnel operating from our office locations in the U.S. Following the sale of the transformer business units`, we no longer have office locations or employees in Canada. Our direct sales force markets to end users and to third parties, such as original equipment manufacturers, engineering firms that prescribe the specifications and parameters that control the applications of our products and commercial and residential parties interested in our new and used generation equipment intended to ensure smooth, uninterrupted power to operations during times of emergency.
Sales Backlog
 
Backlog reflects the amount of revenue we expect to realize upon the shipment of customer orders for our products that are not yet complete or for which work has not yet begun. Our sales backlog as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $12.7 million, as compared to $15.9 million as of December 31, 2019 for our continuing operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced a decline in customer orders for its products and services due to delays caused by the pandemic. We anticipate that most of our current backlog will be delivered during 2021. Orders included in our sales backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts that we believe to be firm.

Competition
 
We experience intense competition from a large number of electrical equipment manufacturers and from distributors and servicers of such equipment. The number and size of our competitors varies considerably by product line and service category, with many of our competitors tending to be small, highly specialized or focused on a certain geographic market area or customer. However, several of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources than us, including some of the world’s largest electrical products and industrial equipment manufacturing companies. A representative list of our direct competitors in our T&D Solutions segment includes Crown Electric Engineering and Manufacturing, LLC, Industrial Electric Machinery, LLC, RESA Power, LLC, Myers Power Products, Inc., Powell Industries, Inc. and Eaton Corporation.
 
We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of technical support and application expertise, engineering, manufacturing and service capabilities, equipment rating, quality, scheduling and price. In all our businesses, our objective is to focus our efforts on more specialized, challenging and complex applications. Accordingly, a critical element to the success of our business is responsiveness and flexibility in providing custom-engineered solutions to satisfy customer needs. As a result of our long-time presence in the industry, we possess a number of special designs and libraries of programming code for our equipment that were engineered and developed specifically for our customers. We believe these factors give us a competitive advantage and that they are a major contributor to our frequency of repeat customer orders and the longevity of our customer relationships.
 
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
The principal raw materials purchased by us are steel, copper, sensors, circuit breakers, meters and relays. We also purchase certain electrical components from a variety of suppliers including switches, fuses, protectors and circuit breakers. These raw materials and components are available from and supplied by numerous sources at competitive prices. Unanticipated increases in raw material prices or disruptions in supply could increase production costs and adversely affect our profitability. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements on reasonable terms and have not experienced any such difficulty in the past several years. Our largest suppliers during the year ended December 31, 2020 included Industrial Connections & Solutions, LLC, Eaton Corporation, Royal Industrial Solutions, Thyssenkrupp Materials NA, and ABB, Inc.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 94 employees consisting of 22 salaried staff and 72 hourly workers. Certain of our hourly employees located at our manufacturing facility in Santa Fe Springs, California are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Local Union 1710 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO that expires in June 2022.
Environmental
 
We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other areas, air emissions, discharges into waterways and the generation, handling, storing, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. These laws and regulations are constantly changing and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect they may have on us in the future. Like many other industrial enterprises, our manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, which may result in fines, penalties and remediation costs, and there can be no assurance that such costs will be insignificant. To our knowledge, we are in substantial compliance with all federal, state, provincial and local environmental protection provisions, and believe that the future compliance cost should not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position. However, legal and regulatory requirements in these areas have been increasing and there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future due to regulatory noncompliance.
Corporate History
 
We were originally formed in the State of Nevada in 2008. On November 30, 2009, we merged with and into Pioneer Power Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation, for the sole purpose of changing our state of incorporation from Nevada to Delaware and changing our name to “Pioneer Power Solutions, Inc.” On September 24, 2013, we completed an underwritten public offering and our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol PPSI.
