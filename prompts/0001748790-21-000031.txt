Item 1. - Business
The Company 
    Amcor plc (ARBN 630 385 278) is a holding company originally incorporated under Arctic Jersey Limited as a limited company under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey in July 2018, in order to effect our combination with Bemis Company, Inc. On October 10, 2018, Arctic Jersey Limited was renamed "Amcor plc" and became a public limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey.
Bemis Company, Inc. Acquisition
    On June 11, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc. ("Bemis"), a global manufacturer of flexible packaging products, pursuant to the definitive merger agreement (the "Agreement") between Amcor Limited and Bemis dated August 6, 2018. Under the terms of the Agreement, Bemis shareholders received 5.1 Amcor shares for each share of Bemis stock and Amcor shareholders received one Amcor CHESS Depositary Instrument ("CDI") for each share of Amcor Limited stock issued and outstanding. Upon completion of the transaction, the Amcor shares were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "AMCR" and the CDIs representing our shares on the Australian Securities Exchange ("ASX") are traded under the symbol "AMC." In addition, Amcor Limited shares were delisted from the ASX and Bemis shares were delisted from the NYSE.
Business Strategy
Strategy
    Our strategy consists of three components: a focused portfolio, differentiated capabilities, and our aspiration to be THE leading global packaging company. To fulfill our aspiration, we are determined to win for our customers, employees, shareholders, and the environment.
Focused portfolio
    Our portfolio of businesses share some important characteristics:
•A focus on primary packaging for fast-moving consumer goods,
•good industry structure,
•attractive relative growth, and
•multiple paths for us to win through our leadership position, scale, and ability to differentiate our product offering through innovation.
    These criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesses we have today across: flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closures.
Differentiated capabilities
    "The Amcor Way" describes the capabilities deployed consistently across Amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio: Talent, Commercial Excellence, Operational Leadership, Innovation, and Cash and Capital Discipline.
Shareholder value creation
    Through our portfolio of focused businesses and differentiated capabilities, we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior value for shareholders. The nature of our consumer and healthcare end markets mean that year-to-year volatility should be relatively low, measured on a constant currency basis. Over time value creation has been strong and consistent and has reflected a combination of dividends, organic growth in the base business, and using free cash flow to pursue targeted acquisitions and/or returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks.
Segment Information
    Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280, "Segment Reporting," establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. In applying the criteria set forth in ASC 280, we have determined we have two reportable segments, Flexibles and Rigid Packaging. The reportable segments produce flexible packaging, rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closure products, which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, and the Asia Pacific regions. Refer to Note 20, "Segments," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about reportable segments.
Flexibles Segment
    The Flexibles Segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally. With approximately 39,000 employees at 174 significant manufacturing and support facilities in 39 countries as of June 30, 2021, the Flexibles Segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of plastic, aluminum, and fiber based flexible packaging. In fiscal year 2021, Flexibles accounted for approximately 78% of our consolidated net sales.
Rigid Packaging Segment
    The Rigid Packaging Segment manufactures rigid packaging containers and related products in the Americas. As of June 30, 2021, the Rigid Packaging Segment employed approximately 6,000 employees at 51 significant manufacturing and support facilities in 11 countries. In fiscal year 2021, Rigid Packaging accounted for approximately 22% of our consolidated net sales.
Marketing, Distribution, and Competition
    Our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels, but primarily through our direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers. Our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design technicians, field service technicians, and a customer service organization. 
    We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for fiscal years 2021 and 2020. Sales to PepsiCo, and its subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 11% of our total net sales in fiscal year 2019. Business arrangements with PepsiCo are aggregated across a number of separate contracts in disparate locations and any change in these business arrangements would typically occur over a period of time.
     The major markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price. Competitors include AptarGroup, Inc., Ball Corporation, Berry Global Group, Inc, CCL Industries Inc., Crown Holdings, Inc., Graphic Packaging Holding Company, Huhtamaki Oyj, International Paper Company, Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG, O-I Glass, Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Silgan Holdings Inc., Sonoco Products Company, and WestRock Company, and a variety of privately held companies. 
    We consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the markets in which we operate; however, due to the diversity of our business, our precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable. 
Backlog
    Working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions. We maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders. Manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the industries in which we operate.
Raw Materials
    Polymer resins and films, paper, inks, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use. These are purchased from a variety of global industry sources, and we are not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials. While temporary industry-wide shortages of raw materials have occurred, including during the second half of fiscal 2021, we have been able to manage the supply disruption with no material impact by working closely with our suppliers and customers. Supply shortages can lead to increased raw material price volatility, which we experienced in the second half of fiscal 2021. Increases in the price of raw materials are generally able to be passed on to customers through contractual price 
mechanisms over time and other means. We expect supply disruption and price volatility to continue into fiscal 2022 and will continue to work closely with our suppliers and customers in an effort to minimize the impact on our operations. 
Intellectual Property
    We are the owner or licensee of thousands of United States and other country patents and patent applications that relate to our products, manufacturing processes, and equipment. We have a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries. We also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets. Our patents, licenses, and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage. However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as a whole or those of our reportable segments. Patents, patent applications, and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms, or otherwise.
Sustainability, Innovation, and Environmental Laws and Regulations
    We believe there will always be a role for the primary packaging made by Amcor - to preserve food and healthcare products, protect consumers, and promote brands. Consumers want cost effective, convenient, and easy to use packaging which also has an end of life solution which will reduce waste. We believe responsible packaging is the answer to achieving less waste and that responsible packaging requires three things - innovative packaging design, waste management infrastructure, and consumer participation.
    Amcor is committed to responsible packaging and we see this as being integral to our success. In January 2018, we became the first global packaging company pledging to develop all of our packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025, to significantly increase our use of recycled materials, and to work with others to drive greater recycling of packaging around the world. Sustainability is comprehensively embedded across our business - from how we run our manufacturing operations more efficiently, to the investment we are making in sustainable packaging innovation.
    We are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and we have thousands of active patents. We collaborate with customers, suppliers, and innovators to create industry-leading solutions, and with other stakeholders to increase available infrastructure for waste collection, sorting and recycling, and to inform consumers about the importance of packaging and how to reduce its environmental impacts through recycling. With our global scale, deep industry experience, and strong capabilities, we are uniquely positioned to lead the way in the design and development of more sustainable packaging and this is one of the most important growth opportunities for Amcor.
    We also work to reduce the environmental impacts of our operations, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, production waste, and water use. Our operations and the real property we own, or lease, are subject to broad environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions. These laws and regulations pertain to the discharge of certain materials into the environment, handling and disposition of waste, cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, and other rules to control pollution and manage natural resources. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations based on implementation of our Environmental, Health, and Safety Management System and regular audits of those processes and systems. However, we cannot predict with certainty that we will not, in the future, incur liability with respect to noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations due to contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites) or the off-site disposal of regulated materials, which could be significant. In addition, these laws and regulations are constantly changing, and we cannot always anticipate these changes. Refer to Note 19, "Contingencies and Legal Proceedings," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information about legal proceedings. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors."
Seasonal Factors 
    The business of each of the reportable segments is not seasonal to any material extent.
Research and Development
    Refer to Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our research and development expenditures and policies.
Human Capital Management
Overview
We strive to build an outperformance culture by creating inclusive working environments where every employee feels valued and treated with respect. Our people are core to the achievement of our aspiration 'To be THE leading global packaging company'. We are winning when our people are engaged and developing as part of a high-performing, global team.
At June 30, 2021, we had approximately 46,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 30% located in North America, 30% located in Europe, 20% located in Latin America, and 20% located in the Asia Pacific region. Collective bargaining agreements cover approximately 40% of our workforce. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 4% of our employees were working under expired contracts and approximately 16% were covered under collective bargaining agreements that expire within one year. 
Health and Safety
Safety is a core value at Amcor. We champion safe and responsible behavior among all employees in an effort to achieve an injury-free Amcor. All our facilities abide by global Environment, Health, and Safety ("EHS") standards for safety and environmental management. Our Board of Directors receives monthly reports on safety performance and compliance with our global EHS standards. During fiscal 2021, we reduced the number of injuries by 23%, with all of our business groups reporting fewer injuries versus the prior fiscal year.
Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates our commitment to the health and safety of our employees. We have implemented rigorous protocols supported by precautionary measures in each of our manufacturing and office locations globally to help ensure the health and safety of our people. 
Across each of our locations, our teams have supported the communities where we operate during the pandemic. This has included support for agencies providing educational supplies and other assistance to children who are home schooling and providing support to families in need.
Developing Talent
We are dedicated to attracting, developing, engaging, and retaining the best talent to deliver our 'Winning Aspiration' and ensure a strong succession pipeline for the future. 
The 'Amcor Way' defines those capabilities which we deploy consistently across our business to ensure success. Talent and the pursuit of best in class leadership underpins our approach to Talent. We expect our leaders to follow our rigorous talent review processes as our overarching approach to developing talent.
We have implemented training and education programs to help our employees progress across all functions and experience levels. Examples of these programs include a Future Leader program to further advance high-potential talent, a Senior Leader Development program focusing on developing strategic management skills and inclusive leadership, and an Executive Development program for our most senior leaders. 
Our "JumpStart@Amcor" global program accelerates onboarding of new employees and provides all our people with cross-functional learning. We also run an Accelerated Career Development program to develop commercial capabilities and a talent pipeline.
We track global employee engagement via surveys to collect feedback on a range of topics. Our last survey, undertaken in June 2020, focused, in part, on our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Feedback from the survey provided valuable insight on action undertaken and offered additional, valuable feedback for improvement.
Inclusion, Equity, and Diversity
We are guided by a belief that by creating an inclusive work environment we will achieve better business outcomes. We aspire to create a work environment where everyone feels encouraged to speak up and compelled to listen. We also believe that each employee should be valued, provided with equal opportunities, empowered to deliver impact, and engaged by being treated with trust and respect. 
With this in mind, we work to create a team environment that develops inclusive leaders, where we learn from our people, and where listening, trust, and respect are key behaviors that form the foundation of our interactions and foster mutual understanding. 
We value the diverse experience, strengths, styles, nationalities, and cultures of all our people around the world. We focus on strengthening 'talent through diversity' and progress is reported to our Board annually. We additionally report on gender diversity at our United Kingdom ("UK") sites through our publicly available UK Gender Pay Narrative. We continually review opportunities to strengthen our diversity transparency practices while adhering to privacy legislation in certain regions where we operate.
Ethics
Good corporate governance and transparency are fundamental to achieving our vision of becoming the premier packaging solutions provider in all our markets. Our employees are expected to act with integrity and objectivity and to always strive to enhance our reputation and performance. 
We maintain a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy which is signed by every Amcor employee and provides the Company's framework for making ethical business decisions aligned with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Guidelines for multinational companies. We provide targeted training across the globe to reinforce our commitment to ethics and drive adherence to the national laws in each country in which we operate.
