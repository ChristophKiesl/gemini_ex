Item 1.   Business.
Our Company
 
Our Company began in 1945 under the name Dixie Supply Company in Florence, Alabama.  Although we initially specialized primarily in the marine and small aircraft business, by 1960, we were solely in the sporting goods business.  In 1965, we opened our second store, Dyess & Hibbett Sporting Goods, in Huntsville, Alabama, and hired Mickey Newsome, who is now Chairman of our Board.  The following year, we opened another sporting goods store in Birmingham and by the end of 1980, we had 12 stores in central and northwest Alabama with a distribution center located in Birmingham and our central accounting office in Florence.  We became a public company in October 1996.
 
Today, we operate athletic specialty stores in small and mid-sized markets predominantly in the South, Southwest, Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest regions of the United States.  As of January 28, 2017, we operated 1,078 stores consisting of 1,059 Hibbett Sports stores and 19 smaller-format Sports Additions athletic shoe stores in 35 states.  Our primary retail format and growth vehicle is Hibbett Sports, an approximately 5,000 square foot store located primarily in strip centers which are frequently influenced by a Wal-Mart store.  Approximately 82% of our Hibbett Sports store base is located in strip centers, which includes free-standing stores, while approximately 18% of our Hibbett Sports store base is located in enclosed malls.  We expect to continue our store base growth in strip centers versus enclosed malls.
 
We offer convenient locations and a broad assortment of quality brand name footwear, apparel, accessories and athletic equipment at competitive prices in a full service environment.  We believe that the breadth and depth of our brand name merchandise consistently exceeds the product selection carried by most of our competitors, particularly in our smaller markets.  Many of these brand name products are highly technical and require knowledgeable sales assistance.  We educate our sales staff on new products and trends through coordinated efforts with our vendors.

Our Business Strategy
 
We target small, underserved markets with branded products and provide a high level of customer service.  Our strong focus on small communities enables us to achieve significant cost benefits including lower corporate expenses, reduced logistics costs and increased economies of scale from marketing activities.  We use information systems to maintain tight controls over inventory and operating costs and continually search for ways to improve efficiencies and the customer experience through information system upgrades.  In addition, we establish greater customer, vendor and landlord recognition as a leading athletic specialty retailer in these communities.  We believe our ability to align our merchandising mix to local preferences and trends differentiates us from our national competitors.
 
We strive to hire enthusiastic sales people with an interest in sports.  Our extensive training program focuses on product knowledge and selling skills and is conducted through the use of in-store clinics, DVDs, self-study courses, interactive group discussions and Hibbett University designed specifically for store management.
 
Our Store Concepts
 
Hibbett Sports:  Our primary retail format is Hibbett Sports, an approximately 5,000 square foot store located primarily in strip centers, which are usually near a Wal-Mart store.  In considering locations for our Hibbett Sports stores, we take into account the size, demographics, quality of real estate and competitive conditions in each market.  Of these stores, 871 Hibbett Sports stores are located in strip centers, which include free-standing stores, with the remaining 188 stores located in enclosed malls, the majority of which are the only enclosed malls in their county.
 
Hibbett Sports stores offer a core merchandising mix of localized apparel, footwear, equipment and accessories designed to appeal to a wide range of customers within each market.  We strive to respond quickly to major sporting events such as Bowl or National Championship games and similar sporting events in college or professional baseball, football and basketball involving teams of local interest within our markets.
 
Sports Additions:  Our 19 Sports Additions stores are primarily enclosed mall-based stores, averaging 2,500 square feet with approximately 90% of merchandise consisting of athletic footwear and the remainder consisting of caps and a limited assortment of apparel.  Sports Additions stores offer a more fashion-based merchandise assortment compared to our Hibbett Sports stores.  All but six Sports Additions stores are currently located in enclosed malls or strip centers where a Hibbett Sports store is also present.
 
Team:  Hibbett Team Sales, Inc. (Team), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a supplier of customized athletic apparel, equipment and footwear primarily to school athletic programs in Alabama and parts of Georgia, Florida and Mississippi.  Team sells its merchandise directly to educational institutions and youth associations.  The operations of Team are independent of the operations of our retail stores.
 
None of our store concepts meets the quantitative or qualitative requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 280, Segment Reporting.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
We identify markets for our Hibbett Sports stores under a clustered expansion program.  This approach primarily focuses on opening new stores within two-hour driving distance of an existing Hibbett location, allowing us to take advantage of efficiencies in logistics, marketing and regional management.  It also aids us in building a better understanding of appropriate merchandise selection for the local market.  In addition to proximity to existing Hibbett stores, we also consider population, economic conditions, local competitive dynamics, availability of suitable real estate and potential for return on investment when evaluating potential markets.

Omni-channel strategy:  Store growth will continue to be a cornerstone of our growth strategy, although we recognize that our customer is evolving and looking to engage with us in multiple ways.  As a result, we continue to make investments that will enable us to engage our customer specifically in the digital commerce channel.  In Fiscal 2017, we made considerable progress towards this goal.  We began building our digital team and selected key partners to build and support our e-commerce platform.  The upgrade of the foundational components for our future e-commerce platform began in Fiscal 2015 and is nearly complete.  This includes the completion of a data center, the completion of a new wholesale and logistics facility, the establishment of a second data center with upgraded disaster recovery capability, the hiring of key IT support staff and the upgrade of our point-of-sale (POS) system and related hardware.
 
We also began the rollout of our store-to-store and store-to-home capability, allowing us to use our chain-wide inventory to satisfy a customer sale.  We expect all stores to have this capability in the first half of Fiscal 2018.  This system will also enable fulfillment capability for our e-commerce channel, which we expect to launch in the back half of Fiscal 2018.  Once implemented, digital commerce will be integrated with our brick and mortar stores and will provide a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers.
 
We recognize that today's customers are mobile.  The e-commerce platform will be adaptable, and will provide an improved customer experience from any mobile device.  In Fiscal 2018, we will also begin development of our mobile app, which will complement our mobile site and provide our customers with even more advanced features.
 
Our Logistics
 
We maintain a single wholesale and logistics facility in Alabaster, Alabama (a suburb of Birmingham) where we receive and ship substantially all of our merchandise.  For key products, we maintain backstock at the facility that is allocated and shipped to stores through an automatic replenishment system based on inventory levels and sales.  Merchandise is typically delivered to stores weekly via Company-operated vehicles or third-party logistics providers.
 See "Risk Factors."
 
We believe strong logistics support for our stores is a critical element of our expansion strategy and is central to our ability to maintain a low cost operating structure.  We use third-party logistics providers to gain efficiencies to approximately 25% of our outlying stores.  Our wholesale and logistics facility is designed with significant automation and operational efficiencies.  We expect the facility will support our growth over the next several years.
Our Merchandise
 
Our merchandising strategy is to provide a broad assortment of premium brand name footwear, apparel, accessories and athletic equipment at competitive prices in a full service environment.
 
The following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories:
 

 | Fiscal 2017 | Fiscal 2016 | Fiscal 2015
----------+-------------+-------------+------------
Footwear | 52% | 49% | 47% 
Apparel | 29% | 29% | 31% 
Equipment | 19% | 22% | 22% 
 | 100% | 100% | 100% 

 
We believe that the assortment of brand name merchandise we offer consistently exceeds the merchandise selection carried by most of our brick and mortar competitors, particularly in our smaller markets.  Many of these brand name products have limited availability and/or are technical in nature requiring considerable sales assistance.  We coordinate with our vendors to educate the sales staff at the store level on new products and trends.

Although the core merchandise assortment tends to be similar for each Hibbett store, important demographic, local and/or regional differences exist.  Accordingly, our stores offer products that reflect preferences for particular demographics as well as interests from each community.  Our knowledge of these interests, combined with access to leading vendors, enables our merchandising staff to react quickly to emerging trends or special events, such as fashion shifts or athletic events.
 
Our merchandising staff, operations staff and management analyze current trends primarily through the lens of our store typing strategy.  This information is gathered and analyzed utilizing our business intelligence tool.  Other strategic measures we utilize to recognize trends or changes in our industry include:
 
 
· | maintaining close relationships with vendors and other retailers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | studying other retailers for best practices in merchandising;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | attending various trade shows, both in our industry and outside as well as reviewing industry trade publications;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | actively participating in industry associations such as the National Sporting Goods Association (NSGA);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | visiting competitor store locations;
--+-------------------------------------


· | monitoring industry data sources and periodicals;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | monitoring product selection at competing stores and online; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | communicating with our regional vice presidents, district managers and store managers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The merchandising staff works closely with store personnel to meet the requirements of individual stores for appropriate merchandise in sufficient quantities.  See "Risk Factors."
 
Our Vendor Relationships
 
The athletic specialty retail business is brand name driven.  Accordingly, we maintain positive relationships with a number of well-known vendors to satisfy customer demand.  We believe that our stores are among the primary brick and mortar retail distribution avenues for brand name vendors that seek to penetrate our target markets.  As a result, we are able to attract considerable vendor interest and establish long-term partnerships with vendors.  As our vendors expand their product lines and grow in popularity, we expand sales of these products within our stores.  In addition, as we continue to increase our store base and enter new markets, our vendors increase their brand presence within these regions.  We also work with our vendors to establish favorable pricing and to receive cooperative marketing funds.  See "Risk Factors."
Our Information Systems
 
            We continue to use technology as an enabler of our business strategies.  We have implemented and maintained systems targeted at improving financial control, cost management, inventory control, merchandise planning, logistics, replenishment, and product allocation.  In recent years, we have focused on information systems that are designed to be used in all stores, yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each specific store location. Additionally, we have begun transitioning toward omni-channel retailing, which has driven modernization efforts for existing systems and development of new systems to support our future online presence.
 
Our communications network sends and receives critical business data to and from our stores, our third party cloud providers, and our managed hosting facility (second data center).  Our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets.  We attempt to mitigate the risk of cyber-security threats and business interruptions by maintaining strong security protocols, threat monitoring, regular risk reviews, and a detailed disaster recovery plan.
 
            We strive to maintain highly qualified and motivated teams of individuals to support our information systems, which includes security, help desk, engineering, quality assurance, business analysis, solution development and project managers.  Our systems are monitored 24 hours a day.  Our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will continue to support our current needs and future growth.  We use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning and enterprise risk management. Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business criteria.

 Our Advertising and Promotion
 
We target advertising opportunities in our markets to increase the effectiveness of our advertising budget.  Our advertising and promotional spending is centrally directed.  Print advertising, including direct mail pieces and postcards to customers, has historically served as the foundation of our promotional program and accounted for the majority of our total advertising costs in Fiscal 2017.

Due to the effective performance of these traditional marketing vehicles, we will continue to invest in them in Fiscal 2018.  We will also add significant investments in digital marketing to support the launch of our e-commerce site and other omni-channel initiatives.  Future incremental investments include search engine optimization (SEO), paid search, influencer campaigns and Instagram/Facebook marketing.  We utilize the Hibbett marketing team as well as external digital marketing agencies to ensure execution and returns from these new programs.
 
 We offer a customer loyalty program, the MVP Rewards program, whereby customers can earn reward certificates that can be redeemed in our stores.  Our MVP Rewards program represents a significant portion of overall sales, although we recognize there are opportunities to drive additional sales through enhancements to the program.  In Fiscal 2017, we analyzed customer shopping data and surveyed customers to identify these opportunities, and as a result, we will launch an improved program in Fiscal 2018 that will provide more features and value to our customers.
 
Our Competition
 
The business in which we are engaged is highly competitive.  The marketplace for athletic specialty merchandise is highly fragmented as many different brick and mortar and online retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of formats and merchandising strategies.  We compete with department and discount stores, traditional shoe stores, specialty sporting goods shops, local sporting goods stores, outlet centers, mass merchandisers, e-commerce retailers and, in some of our large and mid-size markets, national sporting goods superstores.  In addition, we face competition from vendors that sell directly to consumers.
 
Although we face competition from a variety of competitors, we believe that our stores are able to compete effectively by providing a premium assortment of footwear, apparel, accessories and team sports merchandise.  Additionally, we differentiate our store experience through extensive product knowledge, customer service and convenient locations.  We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors in the smaller markets predominantly in the South, Southwest, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the United States.  See "Risk Factors."
 
Our Trademarks
 
Our Company, by and through subsidiaries, is the owner or licensee of trademarks that are very important to our business.  For the most part, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.  Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use.
 
Following is a list of active trademarks registered and owned by the Company:

Our Employees
 
As of January 28, 2017, we employed approximately 3,200 full-time and approximately 6,100 part-time employees, none of whom are represented by a labor union.  The number of part-time employees fluctuates depending on seasonal needs.  We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.  We have implemented programs in our stores and corporate offices to ensure that we hire and promote the most qualified employees in a non-discriminatory way.
Employee Development:  We develop our training programs in a continuing effort to service the needs of our customers and employees.  These programs include DVD training in all stores for the latest in technical detail of new products and new operational and customer service techniques.  Because we primarily promote or relocate current employees to serve as managers for new stores, training and assessment of our employees is essential to our sustained growth.
 
One of the most significant training programs we have is Hibbett University or "Hibbett U", which is an intensive, five-day session designed specifically for store management.
 
Seasonality
 
We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and results of operations.  We typically experience higher net sales in early spring due to spring sports and annual tax refunds, late summer due to back-to-school shopping and winter due to holiday shopping.  In addition, our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of new store openings, the amount and timing of net sales contributed by new stores, weather fluctuations, merchandise mix, demand for merchandise driven by local interest in sporting events, and the timing of sales tax holidays and annual tax refunds.
 
Although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions, we do not believe that, historically, inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations as we are generally able to pass along inflationary increases in costs to our customers.
