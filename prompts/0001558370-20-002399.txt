Item 1.    Business
Company Overview 
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing the next generation of antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs, to improve outcomes for cancer patients. By generating targeted therapies with enhanced anti-tumor activity and favorable tolerability profiles, we aim to disrupt the progression of cancer and offer patients more good days. We call this our commitment to ‘‘target a better now.’’ 
An ADC with our proprietary technology comprises an antibody that binds to a target found on tumor cells and is conjugated to one of our potent anti-cancer agents as a ‘‘payload’’ to kill the tumor cell once the ADC has bound to its target. ADCs are an expanding approach to the treatment of cancer, with seven approved products and the number of agents in development growing significantly in recent years. 
We have established a leadership position in ADCs with a portfolio of differentiated product candidates to address both solid tumors and hematological malignancies.
Our lead program is mirvetuximab soravtansine, a first-in-class investigational ADC targeting folate-receptor alpha, or FRα, a cell-surface protein overexpressed in a number of epithelial tumors, including ovarian, endometrial, and non-small-cell lung cancers. In March of 2019, we announced that FORWARD I, our Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating mirvetuximab compared to chemotherapy in women with FRα-positive, platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, which we refer to collectively as PROC, did not meet the primary endpoint in either the entire treatment population or the pre-specified high FRα expression population. Data from FORWARD I did, however, show promising efficacy signals across a range of parameters in the pre-specified subset of patients with high FRα expression. In post hoc exploratory analyses using a PS2+ scoring method, in the FRα-high population scored by the PS2+ method, mirvetuximab was associated with longer progression free survival, or PFS, by blinded independent review committee, or BIRC, higher overall response rate, or ORR, and longer overall survival, or OS. 
Following consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we will concurrently enroll two new trials of mirvetuximab: SORAYA, a single-arm clinical trial that, if successful, could lead to accelerated approval of mirvetuximab; and MIRASOL, a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial that, if successful, could lead to full approval of mirvetuximab. We anticipate enrolling our first patient in SORAYA during the first quarter of 2020, and expect to report top-line data from this trial in mid-2021. We opened enrollment in MIRASOL in December 2019 and expect to report 

3




top-line data from this trial in the first half of 2022. If SORAYA is successful, we expect to submit an application for accelerated approval of mirvetuximab in the applicable patient population to the FDA during the second half of 2021 and to thereafter seek full approval on the basis of a confirmatory Phase 3 trial, MIRASOL.
We undertook a review of our operations during the second quarter of 2019 with the goals of prioritizing our portfolio and reducing our cost base to ensure that our cash resources will be sufficient to advance certain of our programs through the next stages of development. Based on the outcome of this operational review and subsequent consultation with FDA, we have established three strategic priorities for the business: (i) execute SORAYA and MIRASOL and pursue the development of additional indications for mirvetuximab in ovarian cancer; (ii) advance a select portfolio of three earlier-stage product candidates; and (iii) further strengthen our balance sheet and expand our capabilities through partnering. Consistent with these priorities, we have focused our operations on the following activities:

◾ | open SORAYA and enroll patients in MIRASOL to support the potential for accelerated approval in 2022 and conversion to full approval in 2023;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | continue follow up in the ongoing Phase 1b FORWARD II companion trial of mirvetuximab in combination regimens and initiate additional combination trials to support expanded indications;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | continue IMGN632 development in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, or BPDCN, and other CD123-positive hematologic malignancies in collaboration with Jazz Pharmaceuticals, PLC, or Jazz;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | advance two additional assets that demonstrate our continued innovation in ADCs: IMGC936, which is an investigational ADC directed to the novel solid tumor target, ADAM9, which we are co-developing with MacroGenics, Inc., or MacroGenics; and our next generation investigational anti-FRα ADC, IMGN151, which is expected to enter preclinical development in 2020; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | monetize our remaining portfolio and platform technologies through out-licensing transactions or asset sales.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Corresponding to the prioritization of our portfolio, we have reduced ongoing expenses through the discontinuation of our IMGN779 development program, suspension of all other research activities, and a reduction in our workforce.
In January 2020, we announced the closing of a public offering of 24,523,750 shares of common stock at a price of $4.25 per share. We received net proceeds from the offering of $97.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering, together with its existing capital, to fund our operations, including, but not limited to, clinical trial activities, supply of drug substance and drug product, pre-commercialization activities, capital expenditures, and working capital. 
Mirvetuximab soravtansine in ovarian cancer
Mirvetuximab is an investigational ADC targeting FRα. Mirvetuximab is designed to exhibit a differentiated profile with a distinct mechanism of action and is the first ADC to enter a pivotal trial for the treatment of ovarian cancer. It comprises an FRα-binding antibody, which targets the ADC to FRα-expressing cancer cells, conjugated to our potent DM4 payload agent that kills the targeted cancer cells. Based on our clinical experience to date, we have observed encouraging anti-tumor activity and tolerability with mirvetuximab in a range of settings within ovarian cancer, including as monotherapy and in combination with bevacizumab in patients with platinum-resistant disease and in combinations with bevacizumab and carboplatin in patients with platinum-sensitive disease. Mirvetuximab has been granted orphan drug designation in the United States and orphan medicinal product status in the European Union, in each case for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Mirvetuximab has also been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of patients with medium to high FRα-positive platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer who received at least one but no more than three prior systemic treatment regimens and for whom single-agent chemotherapy is appropriate as the next line of therapy.
Mirvetuximab as monotherapy
We presented mature PFS and interim OS data from our Phase 3 FORWARD I clinical trial evaluating mirvetuximab compared to chemotherapy in women with FRα-positive, PROC cancer during an oral presentation at the annual European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, Congress in September 2019. FORWARD I randomized 366 patients 2:1 to receive either mirvetuximab or the physician’s choice of single-agent chemotherapy (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, or weekly paclitaxel). Eligibility criteria included patients with PROC that expressed medium or 

4




high levels of FRα, who had been treated with up to three prior regimens. The primary endpoint of this trial was PFS, as assessed by BIRC. The primary endpoint was assessed using the Hochberg procedure in the entire trial population and in the subset of patients with high FRα expression. The Hochberg procedure enables the simultaneous testing of two overlapping populations. Under this statistical analysis plan, if the p-value of the primary endpoint in either population is greater than 0.05, the p-value in the other population needs to be less than or equal to 0.025 to achieve statistical significance. 
The FORWARD I trial did not meet its primary endpoint of PFS in either the entire study population or in the pre-specified subset of patients with high FRα expression. 
In the FORWARD I trial, mirvetuximab was well-tolerated. The most common drug-related adverse events included nausea (46% all grades; 1% grade 3 or greater), blurred vision (42% all grades; 2% grade 3 or greater), and keratopathy (33% all grades; 1% grade 3 or greater). 
Key detailed safety and efficacy findings from FORWARD I included:
Safety: Compared with chemotherapy, mirvetuximab was associated with:

◾ | fewer Grade ≥ 3 treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs (46% vs. 61%);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | fewer dose reductions due to related TEAEs (20% vs. 31%); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | fewer discontinuations due to related TEAEs (5% vs. 8%).
--+---------------------------------------------------------

Efficacy: No significant difference in the primary endpoint of PFS was observed in the entire study population or in the FRα-high population. 

◾ | In the entire study population:
--+--------------------------------


◾ | primary endpoint, PFS by BIRC (months): median PFS: 4.1 vs. 4.4, Hazard Ratio, or HR: 0.981, p-value 0.897;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | ORR by BIRC: 22% vs. 12%, p-value 0.015; and
--+---------------------------------------------


◾ | OS (as of August 2019) (months): median OS: 15.6 vs. 13.9, HR: 0.846, p-value 0.278
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | In the pre-specified FRα-high population:
--+------------------------------------------


◾ | primary endpoint, PFS by BIRC (months): median PFS 4.8 vs. 3.3 months, HR: 0.693, p-value 0.049 (because the p-value in the entire population was greater than 0.05, under the Hochberg procedure, the p-value in the FRα-high population needed to be to less than or equal to 0.025 to achieve statistical significance);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | ORR by BIRC 24% vs. 10%, p-value 0.014; and
--+--------------------------------------------


◾ | OS (as of August 2019) (months): median OS: 16.4 vs. 12.0, HR:0.678, p-value 0.048
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FORWARD I post-hoc exploratory analyses
In post hoc exploratory analyses using a PS2+ scoring method, in the FRα-high population scored by PS2+, mirvetuximab was associated with:

◾ | longer PFS by BIRC (5.6 months vs. 3.2 months);
--+------------------------------------------------


◾ | higher ORR (29% vs. 6%); and
--+-----------------------------


◾ | longer OS (median OS 16.4 months vs. 11.4 months) (as of August 2019).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

FORWARD I learnings from post-hoc exploratory analyses
In light of the negative outcome in the FORWARD I trial, we undertook a comprehensive assessment of the factors that may have contributed to the trial results. We believe that the outcome of FORWARD I and our subsequent exploratory analyses of the data for this trial have allowed us to better design and implement clinical trials of mirvetuximab. The following summarizes what we believe to be the key factors that contributed to the FORWARD I outcome:

◾ | Patient Selection. Previous clinical trials with mirvetuximab used a PS2+ scoring method to assess tumor samples for FRα expression to determine enrollment eligibility in the trial. The PS2+ scoring method assesses both intensity of staining (0, 1+, 2+, or 3+) and percentage of tumor cells staining at each
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5





intensity, with at least 50% of cells with at least 2+ staining considered FRα medium and at least 75% of cells with at least 2+ staining considered FRα high. In preparation for potential launch of a companion diagnostic, a simplified scoring method to assess FRα expression, known as 10X scoring, was implemented for use in the FORWARD I trial. Eligibility for enrollment in FORWARD I was determined by scoring the percentage of the patient’s tumor cells with positive membrane staining by ≤ 10X magnification without the need to separately assess the level of intensity of the staining. Reassessment of the FORWARD I tumor samples using the PS2+ scoring method suggests that the 10X scoring method inadvertently introduced a population of patients into FORWARD I with lower levels of FRα expression than intended and, for those patients with high levels of FRα expression upon re-scoring utilizing the PS2+ method, we observed efficacy outcomes for mirvetuximab in this post hoc exploratory analysis much more in line with our previous experience, with improved activity correlating with FRα expression and the strongest treatment effect observed in the PS2+ FRα high patient population. Based on this analysis, we will revert to PS2+ scoring for all subsequent trials.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Patient Population. FORWARD I enrolled patients with both medium and high levels of FRα expression. Our exploratory analyses (including re-scoring the PS2+ method) suggest that, while mirvetuximab demonstrated activity in patients with medium levels of expression, in FRα high patients, mirvetuximab compared to chemotherapy was associated with longer PFS, higher ORR, and longer OS. Accordingly, SORAYA and MIRASOL will enroll only patients with high levels of FRα expression, as assessed by the PS2+ scoring method.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Statistical Design. In order to evaluate patients with medium levels of FRα-expression, the statistical analysis plan for FORWARD I deployed the Hochberg procedure, with the potential need for alpha splitting when assessing the primary endpoint between the entire patient population and the subset of patients with high FRα expression. MIRASOL is designed to preserve the full alpha for the primary endpoint assessment in FRα high patients. With the benefit of data from FORWARD I (which targeted a HR of 0.58), MIRASOL is a slightly larger trial, designed with a target HR of 0.70.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the benefit of the information obtained from these exploratory analyses, we believe that the patient selection and statistical design considerations we are implementing in MIRASOL and SORAYA will increase the likelihood of a positive outcome in these trials. Based upon the data generated to date in the mirvetuximab development program and our discussions with the FDA, we will pursue two trials of mirvetuximab as monotherapy, either one of which we believe would support the FDA’s approval of the drug candidate.
Mirvetuximab single-arm pivotal trial (SORAYA)
In December 2019, we announced that the FDA advised us that a new single-arm trial in PROC could support accelerated approval for mirvetuximab, provided that ORR and DOR surpass those of the best available therapy at the time of regulatory action. The FDA further advised that prior to obtaining accelerated approval on the basis of a new single-arm trial, our planned confirmatory trial, MIRASOL, should be fully accrued. Based on this feedback, we plan to initiate SORAYA, a pivotal trial to evaluate mirvetuximab monotherapy in women with FRα-high PROC who have been previously treated with bevacizumab. SORAYA is a single-arm trial of mirvetuximab that is designed to enroll approximately 110 patients. Eligibility criteria include patients with PROC whose tumors express high levels of FRα using the PS2+ scoring method, and who have been treated with up to three prior regimens — at least one of which included bevacizumab. The primary endpoint of this trial is ORR by investigator assessment and the key secondary endpoint is DOR. We have reviewed the data generated from our previous trials with mirvetuximab, including a post hoc analysis of our Phase 3 FORWARD I trial using a PS2+ scoring method to assess tumor samples for FRα expression, and have identified 70 patients who we believe would have met the key eligibility criteria for SORAYA. Based on a pooled analysis of these 70 patients, the pooled ORR in these patients was 31.4% with a 95% CI (20.9%, 43.6%) with a median DOR of 7.8 months with a 95% CI (3.98, -). We believe that these data would compare favorably to the response rate seen with single agent chemotherapy in platinum resistant disease, which was 11.8% in the AURELIA trial comparing bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy versus a physician’s choice of single-agent chemotherapy for PROC, and 12.2% in the CORAIL trial of lurbinectedin versus chemotherapy in patients with PROC, both of which included patients naïve to and previously treated with bevacizumab.
We anticipate enrolling the first patient in SORAYA during the first quarter of 2020 and expect to report topline data from the trial in mid-2021. If SORAYA is successful, we expect to submit an application for accelerated approval of mirvetuximab in this patient population to the FDA during the second half of 2021.

Mirvetuximab randomized Phase 3 trial (MIRASOL)
The findings of the FORWARD I exploratory analyses have informed the design of our planned Phase 3 trial of mirvetuximab in FRα-high patients. We received feedback from FDA and the European Medicines Agency on the design of this trial, which we call MIRASOL. MIRASOL is a randomized Phase 3 trial in which approximately 430 patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either mirvetuximab or investigator’s choice of single-agent chemotherapy (weekly paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or topotecan). Eligibility criteria include patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer whose tumors express high levels of FRα using the PS2+ scoring method, and who have been treated with up to three prior regimens. The primary endpoint of this trial is PFS by investigator assessment. The key secondary endpoints include ORR, OS, and patient-reported outcomes using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-OV28 Abdominal/GI Symptom Scale.
In February 2020, we enrolled the first patient in MIRASOL and expect to report topline data from this trial in the first half of 2022. If successful, we believe that MIRASOL may support full approval of mirvetuximab, which could occur as early as 2023.
Mirvetuximab in combination therapy (FORWARD II)
Mirvetuximab is also being assessed in multiple combinations in FORWARD II, a Phase 1b/2 trial designed to expand the market opportunity into earlier lines of ovarian cancer. To date, we have presented combination data from more than 100 patients in cohorts combining mirvetuximab with pembrolizumab, bevacizumab, and carboplatin.
We presented mature data from the doublet cohort of mirvetuximab in combination with bevacizumab in patients with PROC at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, 2019 annual meeting. We observed encouraging anti-tumor activity with a trend toward durable responses with increasing FRα expression, and favorable tolerability data, including among the subset of patients who received up to two prior lines of therapy and had medium or high levels of FRα expression. Adverse events observed with the combination were as expected based on the side effects historically observed with each agent in the combination, and no new safety signals or clinically meaningful potentiation of known toxicities were observed. Based upon these data as well as previously reported outcomes with a carboplatin doublet, we moved forward with a cohort assessing a triplet combination of mirvetuximab plus carboplatin and bevacizumab in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer. We completed enrollment of the triplet in late 2018 and reported initial data from this cohort at ESMO in September 2019. We believe the initial data from the triplet combination of mirvetuximab demonstrated favorable anti-tumor responses as compared to those of other carboplatin and bevacizumab-based triplet trials. The combination of full dose mirvetuximab, carboplatin and bevacizumab was well tolerated and no new safety signals were seen. Adverse events observed with the triplet were as expected based on the side effects observed with each agent, with thrombocytopenia as the most common cause of drug-related discontinuations.
In addition, to address evolving treatment paradigms, we are conducting a second mirvetuximab plus bevacizumab cohort in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer for which we completed enrollment in the third quarter of 2019. We expect to present data from this cohort in mid-2020. In addition, working with our collaborators in Germany under an investigator-sponsored protocol, we plan to initiate a randomized controlled trial in the first half of 2020 comparing the combination of mirvetuximab plus carboplatin to investigator choice platinum-based therapy in recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.
IMGN632 — accelerating pipeline of earlier-stage antibody-drug conjugates
We have also developed a new class of investigational indolino-benzodiazepine DNA-acting cytotoxic payloads that we refer to as IGNs. Our IGNs are designed to alkylate DNA without cross-linking, which has provided a broad therapeutic index in preclinical models. Specifically, IGN ADCs have retained the anti-tumor potency of crosslinking drugs with less toxicity to normal cells in in vitro and animal models. These properties have allowed for repeat administration of ADCs with IGN payloads in clinical studies and as supported by preclinical data, suggest that IGNs may be able to be combined with other agents.
IMGN632 is an investigational ADC comprised of a high affinity antibody designed to target CD123 with site specific conjugation to to our most potent IGN payload. We are advancing IMGN632 in clinical trials for patients with AML and BPDCN. We recently presented data from our Phase 1 clinical trial of IMGN632 in patients with relapsed or refractory adult AML and BPDCN. We have also determined a Phase 2 dose and schedule for IMGN632 and have initiated a clinical trial with combinations in AML as well as monotherapy in front-line patients with minimal residual disease following induction therapy. In addition, we continue to enroll BPDCN patients under our initial protocol.

Phase 1 data on IMGN632 as a monotherapy in AML and BPDCN
In December 2019, we announced that new safety and efficacy findings from the dose escalation and expansion of the ongoing first-in-human trial of IMGN632 in patients with relapsed/refractory AML and BPDCN were presented in an oral session at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, annual meeting. We believe that these data demonstrate the potential of IMGN632 to offer a new treatment option for patients with AML and BPDCN. With the benefit of a comprehensive assessment of IMGN632’s safety and clinical effect in this Phase 1 clinical trial across a wide range of doses and two schedules, we have selected a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule that have been associated with anti-tumor activity, favorable tolerability, and the convenience of a short infusion that can be administered in an outpatient setting.
IMGN632 was administered to 95 patients over six dose levels on the every three week schedule and over three dose levels on the fractionated schedule. IMGN632 was well-tolerated over a broad range of doses. The most common treatment-related adverse event was infusion-related reactions (24% all grades, 8% Grade 3); none required IMGN632 discontinuation. Single dose-limiting toxicities were seen at the higher dose levels tested: three reversible cases of veno-occlusive disease at greater than or equal to 0.18 mg/kg per cycle and one prolonged neutropenia at 0.3 mg/kg after two cycles. Based on the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic data generated, the dose and schedule of 0.045 mg/kg given on day one every three weeks has been selected as the monotherapy recommended Phase 2 dose.
Across all dose levels and both schedules, of the AML patients assessable for clinical effect (n=71), 38 (54%) had a reduction in bone marrow blasts and 13 (18%) achieved a response, including two complete remissions, or CR, and ten with incomplete recovery, or CRi, and one morphologic leukemia free state, or MLFS, in heavily pretreated patients. The vast majority of these responders (92%) had failed prior intensive therapies, including three with prior transplant, 69% had failed two to three prior lines of therapy, and 54% had an adverse risk classification. At the dose and schedule selected as the recommended Phase 2 dose (0.045 mg/kg Q3W), a 40% response rate was seen in relapsed and refractory patients with de novo AML, including one CR, four CRi, and one MLFS (with subsequent conversion to CRi).
Of the evaluable relapsed/refractory BPDCN patients, three of nine (33%) achieved a response after one or two doses of 0.045 mg/kg IMGN632 (one CR, one CRi, and one partial remission); all three patients had received prior SL-401 (tagraxofusp-erzs), two had received intense multi-agent chemotherapy, and/or prior stem cell transplant.
Preclinical data on IMGN632 in combination therapy in AML
In addition, IMGN632 was evaluated in combination with azacitidine, and as a triplet with azacitidine and venetoclax in AML models, including patient derived xenografts, which are referred to as PDX. As reported by our collaborators from MD Anderson at ASH in December 2019, the addition of IMGN632 to azacitidine alone or to azacitidine plus venetoclax was associated with reductions in tumor burden and improved survival in these murine models. We believe that these data support clinical testing of IMGN632 in combination with standard of care therapy including azacitidine, and azacitidine plus venetoclax in AML patients.
Ongoing IMGN632 trials
We believe that the preclinical data on combining IMGN632 with azacitidine and venetoclax generated by our MD Anderson collaborators, as well as their preclinical data on CD123 expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, together with the updated clinical results reported at ASH in December 2019, provide a strong foundation for our ongoing expansion of IMGN632 monotherapy trials in BPDCN, AML and ALL, and the recent initiation of our trial to evaluate IMGN632 combinations with azacitidine and venetoclax in relapsed and frontline AML, as well as IMGN632 as a monotherapy in minimal residual disease positive AML patients.
Our preclinical programs
We continue to advance select preclinical programs, led by IMGC936. IMGC936 is an investigational ADC in co-development with MacroGenics designed to target ADAM9, an enzyme overexpressed in a range of solid tumors and implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. This ADC incorporates a number of innovations, including antibody engineering to extend half-life, site-specific conjugation with a fixed drug-antibody ratio to enable higher dosing, and a next-generation linker and payload for improved stability and bystander activity. We reported encouraging preclinical safety and activity data from this program at the American Association of Cancer Research, or AACR, meeting in 2019 and expect an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for IMGC936 will be submitted to the FDA in the first half of 2020. Finally, we expect our next generation anti-FRα candidate, IMGN151, to move into preclinical development in 2020.

Collaborations and Out-Licenses 
Over the last 38 years, ImmunoGen has assembled the most comprehensive ‘‘toolbox’’ in the ADC field. Our platform technology combines advanced chemistry and biochemistry with innovative approaches to antibody optimization, with a focus on increasing the diversity and potency of our payload agents, advancing antibody-payload linkage and release technologies, and integration of novel approaches to antibody engineering. These capabilities have enabled us to generate a pipeline of novel candidates designed for individual tumor types to have potent anti-tumor activity and favorable safety profiles that we can develop as monotherapies and in combination with existing and novel therapies.
Collaborating on ADC development with other companies allows us to generate revenue, mitigate expenses, enhance our capabilities, and extend the reach of our proprietary platform. The most advanced partner program is Roche’s marketed product, Kadcyla® (ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Our ADC technology is also used in candidates in clinical development with a number of partners. We have evolved our partnering approach to pursue relationships where we can gain access to technology and complementary capabilities, such as our technology swap with CytomX Therapeutics, Inc., or CytomX, as well as co-development and co-commercialization arrangements, such as our relationships with Jazz and MacroGenics. In addition, following our restructuring in 2019, we seek to monetize our remaining portfolio and platform technologies through out-licensing transactions or asset sales. To this end, in December 2019, we granted an exclusive development and commercialization license to CytomX to our cytotoxic payload technology for use with antibodies (and Probodies™ developed therefrom) directed to epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), including certain of our proprietary anti-EpCAM antibodies developed into Probodies utilizing CytomX’s Probody technology, in return for which we will receive an upfront payment from CytomX with the potential for additional payments following CytomX’s successful achievement of pre-defined clinical development, approval, and commercialization milestones, as well as royalties on net sales. 
We have selectively licensed restricted access to our ADC platform technology to other companies to expand the use of our technology and to provide us with cash to fund our own product programs. These agreements typically provide the licensee with rights to use our ADC platform technology with its antibodies or related targeting vehicles to a defined target to develop products. The licensee is generally responsible for the development, clinical testing, manufacturing, registration and commercialization of any resulting product candidate. As part of these agreements, we are generally entitled to receive upfront fees, potential milestone payments, royalties on the sales of any resulting products, and research and development funding based on activities performed at our collaborative partner’s request. 
We only receive royalty payments from our ADC platform technology out-licenses after a product candidate developed under the license has been approved for marketing and commercialized. Additionally, the largest milestone payments under our existing collaborations usually are on later-stage events, such as commencement of pivotal clinical trials, product approval and achievement of defined annual sales levels. Achievement of product approval requires, at a minimum, favorable completion of preclinical development and evaluation, assessment in early-stage clinical trials, advancement into pivotal clinical testing, completion of this later-stage clinical testing with favorable results, and completion of regulatory submissions and a positive regulatory decision. Below is a table setting forth our current ADC partnerships and status of the most advanced program in each partnership:

Below is a brief description of the business relationships underlying each of the foregoing programs. For more information concerning these relationships, including their ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business, please read Note C, Significant Collaborative Agreements, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Roche
In 2000, we granted Genentech, now a unit of Roche, an exclusive development and commercialization license to use our maytansinoid technology with antibodies that target HER2. Roche’s Kadcyla resulted from this license. Kadcyla was approved for marketing in the U.S., EU and Japan in 2013. We are entitled to receive up to a total of $44 million in milestone payments, of which we have received $39 million to date, and also tiered royalties on the commercial sales of Kadcyla or any other resulting products as described below. Roche is responsible for the development, manufacturing, and marketing of any products resulting from this license.
On May 3, 2019, Roche notified the Company that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Kadcyla for adjuvant (after surgery) treatment of people with HER2-positive early breast cancer who have residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant (before surgery) taxane and Herceptin® (trastuzumab)-based treatment, resulting in a $5 million regulatory milestone payment to the Company for a first extended indication, which is included in license and milestone fees for the year ended December 31, 2019. 
In 2015, Immunity Royalty Holdings, L.P., or IRH, paid us $200 million to purchase our right to receive 100% of the royalty payments on commercial sales of Kadcyla arising under our development and commercialization license with Genentech, until IRH had received aggregate Kadcyla royalties equal to $235 million or $260 million, depending on when the aggregate Kadcyla royalties received by IRH reached a specified milestone. Once the applicable threshold would have been met, if ever, we would thereafter have received 85% and IRH would have received 15% of the Kadcyla royalties for the remaining royalty term. In January 2019, we sold our residual rights to receive royalty payments on commercial sales of Kadcyla to OMERS, the defined benefit pension plan for municipal employees in the Province of Ontario, Canada, for $65.2 million, net of $1.5 million of transaction fees. Simultaneously, OMERS purchased IRH’s right to the royalties we previously sold to IRH as described above, therefore obtaining the rights to 100% of the royalties received from that date on.
We also granted Roche, through its Genentech unit, exclusive development and commercialization licenses to use our maytansinoid ADC technology with antibodies to four specified targets, which were granted under the terms of a separate, now expired 2000 right-to-test agreement with Genentech. For each of these licenses, we are entitled to receive up to a total of $38 million in milestone payments and also royalties on the sales of any resulting products. Roche is

We granted Novartis exclusive development and commercialization licenses to our maytansinoid and IGN ADC technology for use with antibodies to six specified targets under a now-expired right-to-test agreement established in 2010. In May 2018, Novartis terminated one of its six development and commercialization licenses. With respect to each remaining license, we are entitled to receive up to a total of $199.5 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting products. Novartis is responsible for the manufacturing, product development, and marketing of any products resulting from this agreement. The standard termination provisions discussed below apply to these licenses.
Oxford BioTherapeutics/Menarini
In 2013, we granted Amgen an exclusive development and commercialization license to our maytansinoid ADC technology for use with antibodies that target CD205 under a now-expired right-to-test agreement, which Amgen sublicensed to Oxford BioTherapeutics, which is developing MEN 1309 with Menarini. With respect to this license, we are entitled to receive up to a total of $34 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting products. Amgen (or its sublicensee(s)) is responsible for the manufacturing, product development, and marketing of any products resulting from this development and commercialization license. The standard termination provisions discussed below apply to this license.
CytomX
In 2016, we granted CytomX an exclusive development and commercialization license to our maytansinoid and IGN ADC technology for use with Probodies™ that target CD166 under a now-expired reciprocal right-to-test agreement. We are entitled to receive up to a total of $160 million in milestone payments plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting product. CytomX is responsible for the manufacturing, product development, and marketing of any products resulting from this license. The standard termination provisions discussed below apply to this license. 
In 2017, we took exclusive development and commercialization licenses to CytomX’s proprietary Probody technology for use with Probodies that target two specified targets under the same reciprocal right-to-test agreement. We terminated one of these licenses for convenience prior to the end of 2017. We terminated the second license in December 2019, in connection with the grant of the EpCAM license to CytomX discussed below.
In December 2019, we granted CytomX an exclusive development and commercialization license to our maytansinoid and IGN ADC technology for use with antibodies (and Probodies™ developed therefrom) that target EpCAM. In January 2020, we received a $7.5 million upfront license payment and are entitled to receive up to a total of $355 million in milestone payments plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting product. CytomX is responsible for the manufacturing, product development, and marketing of any products resulting from this license. The standard termination provisions discussed below apply to this license.

In 2015, we granted Takeda an exclusive development and commercialization license to our maytansinoid and IGN ADC technology for use with antibodies that target GCC under a now-expired right-to-test agreement. We are entitled to receive up to a total of $210 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on the commercial sales of any resulting products. Takeda is responsible for the manufacturing, product development, and marketing of any products resulting from this license. The standard termination provisions discussed below apply to this license. In March 2018, the right-to-test agreement expired without Takeda exercising its option to a second license or extending or expanding the agreement as it had the right to do for a third license.
Jazz
In August 2017, we entered into a Collaboration and Option Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with a subsidiary of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc, pursuant to which we granted Jazz options to develop and commercialize, on an exclusive, worldwide basis, IMGN779, IMGN632, and a third ADC from our early research and development pipeline to be designated by Jazz within the first seven years of the Option Agreement term. Each of the foregoing three products is referred to herein as a “Collaboration Product.” In October 2019, Jazz exercised certain of its opt-out rights under the Option Agreement following the termination of our IMGN779 development program. In addition, in November 2019, we executed a First Amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Option Agreement. The First Amendment included an exercise of their opt-out rights related to the termination of our early research programs covered by the Option Agreement in connection with our previously announced restructuring. Under the terms of the Option Agreement, the exercise of both of these opt-out rights will result in a pro-rata reduction in Jazz’s obligation to provide development funding, which will now be limited to support of our IMGN632 development program. The First Amendment also provides for a streamlining of the governance structure under the Option Agreement and a reduction in the option exercise fee that Jazz would pay for the remaining product under the Option Agreement or a back-up to that product. We have the right to co-commercialize IMGN632 with Jazz in the U.S.
Under the terms of the Option Agreement, we received a non-refundable $75 million upfront option fee. Jazz had also agreed to provide up to $100 million in development funding over seven years to support development of the Collaboration Products, which was reduced for the years 2020 through 2024 pursuant to the terms of the First Amendment, as discussed above. We are obligated to use a specified level of efforts to advance the development of IMGN632, and we are responsible for all development costs with respect to IMGN632 in excess of Jazz’s development funding.
Jazz may exercise its option with respect to IMGN632 at any time prior to a pivotal study or any time prior to a biologics license application (BLA) upon payment of an option exercise fee of mid-double digit millions or low-triple digit millions, respectively. The option exercise fee for IMGN632 is subject to certain adjustments depending on the indication(s) for which initial regulatory approval of this product is based. After any option exercise by Jazz, we will share equally with Jazz the costs associated with developing and obtaining regulatory approvals of IMGN632 in the U.S. and the European Union, and Jazz will be solely responsible for such costs with respect to all other territories worldwide.
We are also entitled to receive milestone payments upon US and EU regulatory approvals for IMGN632, plus tiered royalties as a percentage of commercial sales which, depending on sales levels and the stage of development at the time of Jazz’s option exercise, range from the mid- to high-single digits in the lowest tier, to low 10’s to low 20’s in the highest tier. If we designate IMGN632 for co-commercialization, in lieu of receiving a milestone payment based on receiving regulatory approval in the U.S., or royalties on sales in the U.S., we will share equally with Jazz the activities, costs, and profits associated with commercialization in the U.S. The standard termination provisions discussed below apply to the Option Agreement and the license agreement associated with IMGN632 (“License Agreements”), except that if IMGN632 is being co-commercialized by the parties in the U.S., the License Agreement shall remain in effect as long as the parties continue to be engaged in such co-commercialization activities, subject to earlier termination in the event of a material breach.
If Jazz does not exercise its option to IMGN632 or opts out of IMGN632, rights to that product revert to us, and we may continue development and commercialization of IMGN632 without any further involvement by Jazz, except that we would pay Jazz royalties at a rate specified in the Option Agreement or License Agreement, as applicable, on our commercial sales of such product.
Debiopharm
 In May 2017, we entered into an Exclusive License and Asset Purchase Agreement with Debiopharm International, S.A., pursuant to which Debiopharm acquired our antibody-drug conjugate IMGN529, a potential new treatment for patients with CD37-positive B-cell malignancies, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The transaction 

12




includes the sale to Debiopharm of specified intellectual property and other assets related to the IMGN529 program, and an exclusive license to additional intellectual property necessary or useful for Debiopharm to develop and commercialize IMGN529 (now known as Debio 1562).
Under the terms of the agreement, we received a $25 million upfront payment for the IMGN529 program and a $5 million milestone payment following the transfer of technology relating to IMGN529 to Debiopharm. In addition, we are entitled to a $25 million milestone upon IMGN529/Debio 1562 entering a Phase 3 clinical trial. Except for the foregoing upfront and milestone payments, we will not be entitled to receive any additional milestone payments or royalties under the agreement.
Standard Termination Provisions
Standard termination provisions in our license agreements state that the partner may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time upon prior written notice to us. The agreement may also be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions. We may also terminate certain of these agreements upon the occurrence of specified events. Upon termination, the partner’s rights to our intellectual property with respect to the applicable target are cancelled and could then be used by us or re-licensed for that target. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of partner’s royalty obligations, which are determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. For each product and country, royalty obligations commence upon first commercial sale of that product in that country, and extend until the later of either the expiration of the last-to-expire ImmunoGen patent covering that product in that country or the expiration for that country of the minimum royalty period specified in the agreement.
Other Agreements
From time to time we have entered into additional agreements with some of our collaborators pursuant to which we have provided certain CMC-related development and pre-pivotal ADC manufacturing services, or supplied ADC payloads, to them with respect to products they are developing under their licenses with us, with respect to which we have been entitled to receive payments at mutually negotiated rates.
Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets
ImmunoGen has a substantial and robust intellectual property portfolio comprising more than 1,300 issued patents and over 650 pending patent applications on a worldwide basis. Our intellectual property strategy centers on obtaining high quality patent protection directed to various embodiments of our proprietary technologies and product candidates. Using this strategy, our ADC technology and our product candidates are protected through a multi-layered approach. In this regard, we have patents and patent applications covering antibodies and other cell binding agents, linkers, cytotoxic payload agents (e.g., tubulin-acting maytansinoids and DNA-acting IGNs), conjugation methodologies and complete ADCs, comprising one or more of these components, as well as methods of making and using each of the above. Typically, multiple issued patents and pending patent applications cover various embodiments of each of ImmunoGen’s and our licensees’ product candidates.
We consider our tubulin-acting maytansinoid and DNA-acting IGN cytotoxic payload agent technologies to be key components of our overall patent strategy. With regard to our tubulin-acting maytansinoid cytotoxic payload agents, we currently own 27 issued U.S. patents covering various embodiments of our maytansinoid technology including those with claims directed to certain maytansinoids, including DM4 and DM21, and methods of manufacturing of DM1, DM4, and DM21, as well as methods of using the same. These issued patents remain in force until various times between 2020 and 2038. With regard to our IGN payload agents, we have 24 issued U.S. patents covering various aspects of our DNA-acting cytotoxic payload agents, which will expire at various times between 2030 and 2040. In all cases, we have received or are applying for comparable patent protection in other major commercial and manufacturing jurisdictions, including Europe, Japan, and China. In nearly all cases for both our maytansinoid and IGN patent portfolios, we have additional pending patent applications disclosing and claiming many other related and strategically important embodiments of these technologies which, upon issuance or grant, will extend our patent protection term over these technologies by several additional years.
Our intellectual property strategy also includes pursuing patents directed to linkers, antibodies, conjugation methods, ADC formulations and the use of specific antibodies and ADCs to treat certain diseases. In this regard, we have 20 issued patents related to many of our linker technologies, as well as additional pending patent applications disclosing and claiming many other related and strategically important embodiments of these linker technologies, including methods of making the linkers and antibody maytansinoid conjugates comprising these linkers. These issued patents remain in force until various times between 2021 and 2034. We also have 18 issued U.S. patents covering methods of assembling ADCs from their constituent antibody, linker, and cytotoxic payload agent moieties. These issued 

13




patents will expire between 2022 and 2040. In nearly all instances for both our linker and conjugation patent portfolios, we have additional pending patent applications disclosing and claiming many other related and strategically important embodiments of these technologies which, upon issuance or grant, will extend our patent protection term over these technologies by several additional years. In all cases, we have received or are applying for comparable patents in other major commercial and manufacturing jurisdictions including Europe, Japan, and China. 
We also file, prosecute, and maintain a substantial portfolio of patents and patent applications specifically directed to ImmunoGen’s and our licensees’ ADC candidates. In this regard, we craft a detailed patent protection strategy for each ADC as it approaches clinical evaluation. Such strategies make use of the patents and patent applications described in the preceding paragraphs, as well as ADC-specific filings, to create a multi-layered and multi-jurisdictional patent protection approach for each ADC as it enters the clinic. In addition to the platform patent strategy described above and specific to mirvetuximab soravtansine, we have 15 issued U.S. patents and 9 pending U.S. applications covering various embodiments of the composition of matter and methods of treatment using mirvetuximab soravtansine, expiring at various times between 2031 and 2038. These ADC-specific patent strategies are intended to provide the exclusivity basis for revenue and royalties arising from commercial development of each of ImmunoGen’s and our licensees’ ADCs.
We expect our continued independent and collaborative work in each of these areas will lead to other patent applications. We will be the owner of all patents covering our independently generated inventions. In all other instances, we expect to either be the sole owner or co-owner of any patents covering collaboratively generated inventions insofar as they relate to co-developed products or our ADC platform technology, or otherwise have an exclusive or non-exclusive license to the technology covered by such patents.
We cannot provide assurance that pending patent applications will issue as patents or that any patents, if issued, will provide us with adequate protection against competitors with respect to the covered products, technologies, or processes. Defining the scope and term of patent protection involves complex legal and factual analyses and, at any given time, the result of such analyses may be uncertain. In addition, other parties may challenge our patents in litigation or administrative proceedings resulting in a partial or complete loss of certain patent rights owned or controlled by ImmunoGen. Furthermore, as a patent does not confer any specific freedom to operate, other parties may have patents that may block or otherwise hinder the development and commercialization of our technology.
In addition, many of the processes and much of the know-how that are important to us depend upon the skills, knowledge, and experience of our key scientific and technical personnel, which skills, knowledge, and experience are not patentable. To protect our rights in these areas, we require that all employees, consultants, advisors, and collaborators enter into confidentiality agreements with us. Further, we require that all employees enter into assignment of invention agreements as a condition of employment. We cannot provide assurance, however, that these agreements will provide adequate or any meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how, or proprietary information. Further, in the absence of patent protection, we may be exposed to competitors who independently develop substantially equivalent technology or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information.
Competition
We focus on highly competitive areas of product development. Our competitors include major pharmaceutical companies and other biotechnology firms. For example, Pfizer, Seattle Genetics, Roche, Astellas, AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Daiichi Sankyo, GlaxoSmithKline and AbbVie have programs to attach a cell-killing small molecule to an antibody for targeted delivery to cancer cells. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as other institutions, also compete with us for promising targets for antibody-based therapeutics and in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel. Additionally, there are non-ADC therapies available and/or in development for the cancer types we and our partners are targeting. Many competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research and product development capabilities, as well as greater financial, sales, marketing, and human resources than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development, and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours.
In particular, competitive factors within the antibody and cancer therapeutic market include:

● | the safety, efficacy, and convenience of products;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | the timing of regulatory approvals and commercial introductions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | special regulatory designation of products, such as orphan drug and breakthrough therapy designations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14





● | the effectiveness of marketing, sales, and reimbursement efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

Our competitive position depends on a combination of factors. These include effectively pursuing the development of proprietary products, the implementation of clinical development programs, the ability to appropriately manufacture, sell, and market our products, and obtain patent protection for our products. In addition, we must secure sufficient capital resources to accomplish all of the previously mentioned activities. 
Continued development of conventional and targeted chemotherapeutics by large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies may result in new compounds that may compete with our product candidates. Antibodies developed by certain of these companies have been approved for use as cancer therapeutics. In the future, new antibodies or other targeted therapies may compete with our product candidates. Other companies have created or have programs to create potent cell-killing agents for attachment to antibodies. These companies may compete with us for technology out-license arrangements.
Regulatory Matters
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state, and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process and a new biologic must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before it may be legally marketed in the U.S.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to adverse administrative or judicial actions. These actions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any such administrative or judicial action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical and other nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies according to current Good Laboratory Practices, or cGLP, or other applicable regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | development and approval of a companion diagnostic if the FDA or the sponsor believes that its use is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
--+----------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------

Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor will also include a clinical protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness 

15




criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted and clinical trials have begun. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about ongoing or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the sponsor submits additional information that alleviates FDA concerns and FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted.
Each clinical trial must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements in accordance with a protocol included as part of the IND, and timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. A local or central institutional review board, or IRB, acting on behalf of each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed, and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase I: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety and dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase II: This phase involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase III: These trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites and to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional information about the use of the approved drug in the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase IV clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.
The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected or serious patient reactions. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors may request meetings with the FDA. These meetings often occur prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II, and before an NDA or BLA is submitted, but meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the End of Phase II meeting to discuss their Phase II clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase III clinical trial or trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. If this type of discussion occurs, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design of the Phase III clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.
According to FDA guidance for industry on the SPA process, a sponsor that meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for a special protocol assessment and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA is required to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. A SPA request 

16




must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began. If the sponsor makes any unilateral changes to the approved protocol, the agreement will be invalidated.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Most sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. However, there are evolving rules and increasing requirements for publication of all trial-related information, and it is possible that data and other information from trials involving drugs that never garner approval could require disclosure in the future.
Companion Diagnostics
For some of our product candidates, including mirvetuximab soravtansine and potentially others, we plan to work with collaborators to develop or obtain access to in vitro companion or complementary diagnostic tests to identify appropriate patients for these targeted therapies.
If a sponsor or the FDA believes that a diagnostic test is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product, a sponsor will typically work with a collaborator to develop an in vitro diagnostic, or IVD. Companion diagnostics can be used to identify patients likely to be more responsive to a particular therapy or at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product. They may also be useful for monitoring the response to treatment for the purpose of adjusting treatment or doses to achieve improved safety or effectiveness.
IVDs are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, and it issued a final guidance document in 2014, entitled “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices” that is intended to assist companies developing in vitro companion diagnostic devices and companies developing therapeutic products that depend on the use of a specific in vitro companion diagnostic for the safe and effective use of the product. The FDA defined an IVD companion diagnostic device as a device that provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. The FDA also issued a draft guidance on July 15, 2016, entitled, “Principles for Codevelopment of an In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Device with a Therapeutic Product” to serve as a practical guide to assist therapeutic product sponsors and IVD sponsors in developing a therapeutic product and an accompanying IVD companion diagnostic, and on December 7, 2018, it published another draft guidance, “Developing and Labeling In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices for a Specific Group or Class of Oncology Therapeutic Products” which, if finalized, is intended to facilitate class labeling on diagnostic tests for oncology therapeutic products, where scientifically appropriate.
The FDA subsequently introduced the concept of complementary diagnostics that are distinct from companion diagnostics because they provide additional information about how a drug is used or identify patients who are likely to derive the greatest benefit from therapy without being required for the safe and effective use of that drug. The FDA has

not yet provided much guidance on the regulation and use of complementary diagnostics, but several have been approved.
The FDA indicated that it will apply a risk-based approach to determine the regulatory pathway for IVD companion and complementary diagnostic devices, as it does with all medical devices. This means that the regulatory pathway will depend on the level of risk to patients, based on the intended use of the IVD companion diagnostic device and the controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. The two primary types of marketing pathways for medical devices are clearance of a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or 510(k), and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. We expect that any IVD companion diagnostic device developed for use with our drug candidates will utilize the PMA pathway and that a clinical trial performed under an investigational device exemption, or IDE, will have to be completed before the PMA may be submitted.
The FDA expects that the therapeutic sponsor will address the need for an IVD companion diagnostic device in its therapeutic product development plan and that, in most cases, the therapeutic product and its corresponding IVD companion diagnostic device will be developed contemporaneously. If the companion diagnostic test will be used to make critical treatment decisions such as patient selection, treatment assignment, or treatment arm, it will likely be considered a significant risk device for which a clinical trial will be required.
The sponsor of the IVD companion diagnostic device will be required to comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements that apply to clinical trials of significant risk devices. If the diagnostic test and the therapeutic drug are studied together to support their respective approvals, the clinical trial must meet both the IDE and IND requirements.
PMAs must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical, and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA may require several years to complete.
After approval, the use of an IVD companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product will be stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product. In addition, a diagnostic test that was approved through the PMA process or one that was cleared through the 510(k) process and placed on the market will be subject to many of the same regulatory requirements that apply to approved drugs.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies, and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things whether the product is safe, pure, and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity, and potency. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.

18




NDAs or BLAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. Priority review for an NDA for a new molecular entity and original BLAs will be 6 months from the date that the NDA or BLA is filed. In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled Phase IV clinical trials. Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional Phase III trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase IV testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or other elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription, or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
The Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs, and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data need to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. Orphan indications are exempt from PREA. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current, or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond 

19




their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Pediatric exclusivity is a type of marketing exclusivity available in the U.S. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, an additional six months of marketing exclusivity may be available if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA, or a Written Request. If the Written Request does not include clinical trials in neonates, the FDA is required to include its rationale for not requesting those clinical trials. The FDA may request studies on approved or unapproved indications in separate Written Requests. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. To date, we have not received any Written Requests.
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for two types of “generic” biologics—biosimilars and interchangeable biologic products, and provides for a twelve-year data exclusivity period for the first approved biological product, or reference product, against which a biosimilar or interchangeable application is evaluated; however if pediatric clinical trials are performed and accepted by the FDA, the twelve-year data exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months. A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that meets additional requirements that show, among other things, that the product will produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient. In addition, for products administered to a patient more than once, the effects of switching back and forth between the interchangeable product and a reference product on safety and efficacy will have to be evaluated. An interchangeable product may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product.
The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical trials to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage, and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity, and potency.
An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first approved. The first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed, but the exclusivity period may be shortened under certain circumstances.
The FDA has issued a number of final and draft guidance documents in order to implement the law and will likely continue to publish new guidance as new issues relating to biosimilars and interchangeability are identified. The guidance documents provide FDA’s current thinking on approaches to demonstrating that a proposed biological product is biosimilar to a reference product. Although the FDA intends to issue additional guidance documents in the future, the absence of final guidance documents covering all biosimilars issues does not prevent a sponsor from seeking licensure of a biosimilar under the BPCIA, as evidenced by the biosimilar products already approved by the FDA.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; the posting will also indicate whether a drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to seven years of orphan product exclusivity, except in very limited 

20




circumstances. The FDA issued a final rule intended to clarify what constitutes some of those limited circumstances. For example, the FDA will not recognize orphan drug exclusive approval if a sponsor fails to demonstrate upon approval that the drug is clinically superior to a previously approved drug, regardless of whether or not the approved drug was designated an orphan drug or had orphan drug exclusivity. Thus, orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA and we are not able to show the clinical superiority of our drug or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. The FDA continues to periodically provide additional clarification, and in July 2018 published a final guidance entitled, “Clarification of Orphan Designation of Drugs and Biologics for Pediatric Subpopulations of Common Diseases,” 
Mirvetuximab soravtansine has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA in the United States, and orphan medicinal product status by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the European Union for the treatment of ovarian cancer. In the U.S., orphan drug designation provides us with seven years of market exclusivity that begins once mirvetuximab soravtansine receives FDA marketing approval for the use for which the orphan drug status was granted. In the EU, orphan designation will provide us with ten years of market exclusivity that begins after mirvetuximab soravtansine receives marketing authorization for the use for which it was granted. We may pursue these designations for other indications for other product candidates intended for qualifying patient populations.
Expedited Review and Approval; Breakthrough Therapy Designation
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the pre-BLA or pre-NDA meeting. The FDA will respond within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Priority review, which is requested at the time of BLA or NDA submission, is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of drugs to treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. Discussions with the FDA about the feasibility of an accelerated approval typically begin early in the development of the drug in order to identify, among other things, an appropriate endpoint. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the appropriateness of the surrogate marker trial. Mirvetuximab soravtansine was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of patients with medium to high FRα-positive platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer who received at least one but no more than three prior systemic treatment regimens and for whom single-agent chemotherapy is appropriate as the next line of therapy.
In the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Improvement Act, or FDASIA, Congress encouraged the FDA to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of products under accelerated approval. The law required the FDA to issue related draft guidance within a year after the law’s enactment and also promulgate confirming regulatory changes. The FDA published a final guidance on May 30, 2014, entitled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions—Drugs and Biologics.” One of the expedited programs added by FDASIA is that for Breakthrough Therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). A sponsor may request Breakthrough Therapy designation at the time that the IND is submitted, or no later than at the end-of-Phase II meeting. The FDA will respond to a Breakthrough Therapy designation request within sixty days of receipt of the request. A drug that receives Breakthrough Therapy designation is eligible for all fast track designation features, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase I, and commitment from the FDA involving senior managers.

Post-Approval Requirements
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws and regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct.
Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us or our partners pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion, and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced, and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance, or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Other Healthcare Laws 
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we will be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and other countries in which we conduct our business after a product is approved and commercialized. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases, and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. A favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the EMA of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials 

22




within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the EMA, whose decision is binding on all member states.
As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective, or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product.
Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third-party reimbursement. Third-party payers include government healthcare programs such as Medicare, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. We anticipate third-party payers will provide reimbursement for our products. However, these third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We have incorporated certain health outcomes measures in our clinical studies, but may need to conduct expensive additional pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payers. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
Medicare is a federal healthcare program administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as individuals with certain disabilities. Drugs may be covered under one or more sections of Medicare depending on the nature of the drug and the conditions associated with and site of administration. For example, under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which provide coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.
Medicare Part B covers most injectable drugs given in an in-patient setting and some drugs administered by a licensed medical provider in hospital outpatient departments and doctors’ offices. Medicare Part B is administered by Medicare Administrative Contractors, which generally have the responsibility of making coverage decisions. Subject to certain payment adjustments and limits, Medicare generally pays for a Part B covered drug based on a percentage of manufacturer-reported average sales price which is regularly updated. We believe that most of our drugs, when approved, will be subject to the Medicare Part B rules.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for this research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, ACA) enacted in March 2010, was expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry and result in expanded coverage for the uninsured. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, ACA was expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot predict the impact of ACA on pharmaceutical companies as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet occurred. In addition, some members of Congress and the President continue 

23




to express their strong desire to repeal the ACA, and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or effectively repealed; for example, as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the U.S. Congress eliminated the ACA’s individual mandate. These challenges add to the uncertainty of the changes enacted as part of ACA. Moreover, President Trump ran for office on a platform that supported the repeal of the ACA and one of his first actions after his inauguration was to sign an Executive Order commanding federal agencies to try to waive or delay requirements of the ACA that impose economic or regulatory burdens on states, families, the health-care industry and others. The Order also declares that the administration will seek the “prompt repeal” of the law and that the government should prepare to “afford the states more flexibility and control to create a more free and open healthcare market.” At this time, the immediate impact of the ACA is not clear. 
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower.
Research and Development Spending
During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we spent $114.5, $174.5 and $139.7 million, respectively, on research and development activities.
Manufacturing
We contract with third-party contract manufacturers, or CMOs, for the manufacture of our product candidates for both our clinical and potential commercial needs. Our CMO network manufactures antibody, linker, and payload, conjugates the foregoing to create bulk drug substance of our product candidates, and processes the bulk drug substance into vialed and labeled drug product for use in humans. As a result of the closure of our Norwood facility in 2018, we no longer operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates for clinical use, and we have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. Although we are reliant on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our CMOs.
CMOs are subject to extensive governmental regulations and we depend on them to manufacture our product candidates in accordance with cGMP. We have an established quality assurance program to ensure that the CMOs involved in the manufacture of product candidates do so in accordance with cGMP and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulations. We believe that our current CMO network complies with such regulations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 75 full-time employees, of whom 52 were engaged in research and development activities. Of the 52 research and development employees, 39 employees hold post-graduate degrees, of which 13 hold Ph.D. degrees and 3 hold M.D. degrees. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
We have entered into confidentiality agreements with all of our employees, members of our board of directors, and consultants. Further, we have entered into assignment of invention agreements with all of our employees.
In June 2019, the Board of Directors approved a plan to restructure the business to focus resources on continued development of mirvetuximab soravtansine and a select portfolio of three earlier-stage product candidates, resulting in a significant reduction of our workforce, with a majority of these employees separating from the business by mid-July 2019 and most of the remaining affected employees transitioning over varying periods of time of up to 12 months.
In February 2018, we determined to implement a new operating model that will rely on external manufacturing and quality testing for drug substance and drug product for our development programs. The implementation of this new operating model led to the ramp-down of manufacturing and quality activities at our Norwood facility during 2018, with a full decommissioning of the facility occurring in early 2019.
