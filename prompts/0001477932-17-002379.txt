General
 
Hemcare Health Services Inc. (formerly NSU Resources Inc) (“The Company”) was incorporated on January 17, 2007, under the laws of the State of Nevada. The principal offices are located at 5940 S. Rainbow Blvd, Ste 400-32132, Las Vegas, NV 89118. The telephone number is 1 (702) 796-6363. The Company has never declared bankruptcy, it has never been in receivership, and it has never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Our fiscal year end is December 31.
Description of Business
 
HemCare Health Services (“HHS”) is a Health Information Exchange company. HHS is creating a single unified platform enabling the ability to request and retrieve medical information and records while meeting all of today’s Security & Compliance demands for HIPAA, PIPEDA and PHIPA. 
 
Previously, the Company’s business plan and objective through late 2016 was to focus on hemorrhoid medical procedures for which it entered into a license agreement to open hemorrhoid treatment centers and promote the Ultroid Hemorrhoid System globally. However, the Company ceased that plan and is currently redeveloping its future objectives in the Health Information Exchange sector. To this end management, working together with significant shareholders, have been developing strategies and alliances to fulfil this objective. At the close of the fiscal year management began to develop a platform and portal for the Information Exchange with aim to completion and market launch in the 2nd quarter of 2017.

Employees
 
Currently there are no employees of the Company. Management works at the pleasure of the board and for the foreseeable future, additional work on its development efforts are to be contracted out.
Research and Development Expenditures
 
Since the time of our incorporation we have not incurred any research or development expenditures. However with our new objective and plan to enter the Health Information Exchange marketplace this is expected to change in 2017.
Business Strategy
 
HemCare Health Services is developing a Centralized System for Patients, Lawyers & Insurers to Retrieve and Access Medical Records. The centralized system and portal is a cloud-based PIPEDA & HIPAA compliant network of Providers and Record Requestors. Utilizing a secure platform, providers will be able to securely exchange records electronically with third-party requestors. Health care providers with proper authorization can also share records with each other.
Addressing a $7 Billion a Year Problem 
 
In national terms, across the U.S., hospitals spend more than $7 billion annually on customer intake. More than $7 billion, before any sort of medical procedure is done; before a patient even steps out of a waiting room, representing an incredible amount of time and money spent on intake administration.
 
Despite the adoption of electronic health records (EHR) and health information exchanges (HIE), providers are still mailing and faxing paper records because they have no PIPEDA or HIPAA compliant method to exchange records electronically with these third-party requestors. A recent study found that the current method of exchanging patient health information cost a single clinician practice $17,160 per year. 
 
The Company aims to remove these substantial burdens both on an administrative and financial basis. People or firms simply use our secure online request form, pay a small service fee and the Company retrieves, digitizes and stores the records. At this point the requesting client can access the record globally 24 hours a day - 7 days a week to view it or transfer it securely. In fact clients can upload any new records to consolidate and keep all of their records securely in one place.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company under previous management focused on hemorrhoid medical procedures and entered into a license agreement to open hemorrhoid treatment centers and promote the Ultroid Hemorrhoid System globally. In consideration for the transfer of these rights to the Company, it issued 100,000 shares of series A preferred convertible stock. 
 
In late 2016, the Company ceased its operations related to rolling out hemorrhoid treatment centers and had a change of control. Following the change of control and focus, management is currently redeveloping its future objectives in the Health Information Exchange sector. To this end Management, working together with significant shareholders, have been developing strategies and alliances to fulfil this objective. At the close of the fiscal year management began to develop a platform and portal for the Information Exchange with aim to completion and market launch in the 2nd quarter of 2017.
