--------+---------

Introduction
 
Coca‑Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, a Delaware corporation (together with its majority-owned subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”), produces, markets and distributes nonalcoholic beverages. The Company was incorporated in 1980 and, together with its predecessors, has been in the nonalcoholic beverage manufacturing and distribution business since 1902. We are the largest independent Coca‑Cola bottler in the United States. More than 85% of our total bottle/can volume to retail customers consist of products of The Coca‑Cola Company which include some of the most recognized and popular beverage brands in the world. We also distribute products for several other beverage brands including Dr Pepper, Sundrop and Monster Energy. Our purpose is to honor God, serve others, pursue excellence and grow profitably. Our stock is traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol “COKE.”
Ownership
 
As of January 1, 2017, The Coca‑Cola Company owned approximately 35% of the Company’s total outstanding Common Stock, representing approximately 5% of the total voting power of the Company’s combined Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. As long as The Coca‑Cola Company holds the number of shares of Common Stock that it currently owns, it has the right to have a designee proposed by the Company for nomination to the Company’s Board of Directors, and J. Frank Harrison, III, the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and trustees of certain trusts established for the benefit of certain relatives of J. Frank Harrison, Jr. have agreed to vote the shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock which they control in favor of such designee. The Coca‑Cola Company does not own any shares of Class B Common Stock of the Company. J. Frank Harrison III, the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, owns shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 86% of the total voting power of the Company’s combined Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.
Beverage Products
 
We offer a range of flavors designed to meet the demands of our consumers. Our product offerings include both sparkling and still beverages. Sparkling beverages are carbonated beverages and the Company’s principal sparkling beverage is Coca‑Cola. Still beverages include energy products and noncarbonated beverages such as bottled water, tea, ready to drink coffee, enhanced water, juices and sports drinks. 
 
There are two main categories of sales, which include bottle/can sales and other sales. Bottle/can sales include products packaged in plastic bottles and aluminum cans. Other sales include sales to other Coca‑Cola bottlers and “post-mix” products. Post-mix products are dispensed through equipment that mixes the fountain syrup with carbonated or still water, enabling fountain retailers to sell finished products to consumers in cups or glasses.
 
Bottle/can sales represented approximately 84%, 82% and 80% of total net sales for fiscal 2016 (“2016”), fiscal 2015 (“2015”) and fiscal 2014 (“2014”), respectively. The sparkling beverage category represented approximately 66%, 70% and 76% of total bottle/can sales during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
The following table sets forth some of our most important products, including products The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have licensed to us.

Territories
 
We are the largest independent Coca‑Cola bottler in the United States, distributing products in 16 states. Historically, our operational footprint included markets located in North Carolina, South Carolina, south Alabama, south Georgia, central Tennessee, western Virginia and West Virginia (the “Legacy Territories”).
 
As part of The Coca‑Cola Company’s plans to refranchise its North American bottling territories, the Company has engaged in a series of transactions since April 2013 with The Coca‑Cola Company and Coca‑Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (“CCR”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Coca‑Cola Company, to significantly expand the Company’s distribution and manufacturing operations. This expansion includes acquisition of the rights to serve additional distribution territories previously served by CCR (the “Expansion Territories”) and of related distribution assets (the “Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions”), as well as the acquisition of regional manufacturing facilities (“Regional Manufacturing Facilities”) and related manufacturing assets previously owned by CCR (the “Manufacturing Facility Expansion Transactions” and, together with the Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions, the “Expansion Transactions”).
 
The Company’s rights to distribute and market beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company in the Expansion Territories are governed by a Comprehensive Beverage Agreement, as defined below, entered into at each closing for Expansion Territories and are different from the rights we hold under agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company to serve the markets located in the Legacy Territories. The Company is authorized to manufacture beverages bearing trademarks of The Coca‑Cola Company using cold-fill technology at the Regional Manufacturing Facilities pursuant to a Regional Manufacturing Agreement, as defined below, entered into at each closing of a Manufacturing Facility Expansion Transaction. The Company has acquired the following Expansion Territories and Regional Manufacturing Facilities as of January 1, 2017:

Pursuant to the CCR June 2016 LOI, CCR would:

The exchange includes rights to the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of The Coca‑Cola Company-owned and –licensed products and certain cross-licensed brands in each territory and related manufacturing assets.
------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In June 2016, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Coca‑Cola Bottling Company United, Inc. (“United”), an independent bottler that is unrelated to the Company (the “United June 2016 LOI”). Pursuant to this letter of intent, United would transfer exclusive rights and associated distribution assets and working capital in certain territory in and around Spartanburg and Bluffton, South Carolina, currently served by United’s distribution centers located in Spartanburg, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia, in exchange for certain territory in south-central Tennessee, northwest Alabama and northwest Florida currently served by the Company’s distribution centers located in Florence, Alabama and Panama City, Florida. The exchange includes rights to the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of The Coca‑Cola Company–owned and –licensed products and certain cross-licensed brands in each territory.
 
The Company is continuing to work towards a definitive agreement or agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR for the proposed Expansion Transactions described in the February 2016 LOI and the CCR June 2016 LOI. The Company is also continuing to work towards a definitive agreement or agreements with United for the proposed transactions described in the United June 2016 LOI.
 
National Product Supply Governance Agreement (the “NPSG Governance Agreement”)
 
The NPSG Governance Agreement was executed in October 2015 by The Coca‑Cola Company and Regional Producing Bottlers in The Coca‑Cola Company’s national product supply system. Pursuant to the NPSG Governance Agreement, The Coca‑Cola Company and the Regional Producing Bottlers (“RPBs”) have formed a national product supply group (the “NPSG”) and agreed to certain binding governance mechanisms, including a governing board (the “NPSG Board”) comprised of a representative of (i) the Company, (ii) The Coca‑Cola Company and (iii) each other RPB. As The Coca‑Cola Company continues its multi-year refranchising effort over its North American bottling territories, additional RPBs will be added to the NPSG Board. As of January 2017, the NPSG Board consisted of the Company, The Coca‑Cola‑Company and five other RPBs, including CCR.
 
The stated objectives of the NPSG include, among others, (i) Coca‑Cola system strategic infrastructure investment and divestment planning; (ii) network optimization of all plant to distribution center sourcing; and (iii) new product/packaging infrastructure planning. The NPSG Board makes and/or oversees and directs certain key decisions regarding the NPSG, including decisions regarding the management and staffing of the NPSG and the funding for the ongoing operations of the NPSG. The Company is obligated to pay a 
 5


certain portion of the costs of operating the NPSG. Pursuant to the decisions of the NPSG Board made from time to time and subject to the terms and conditions of the NPSG Governance Agreement, the Company and each other RPB will make investments in their respective manufacturing assets and will implement Coca‑Cola system strategic investment opportunities that are consistent with the NPSG Governance Agreement.
 
CONA Services LLC (“CONA”)
 
The Company is a member of CONA, an entity formed with The Coca‑Cola Company and certain Coca‑Cola bottlers to provide business process and information technology services to its members. The Company is subject to a Master Services Agreement (the “Master Services Agreement”) with CONA, pursuant to which CONA agreed to make available, and the Company became authorized to use, the Coke One North America system (the “CONA System”), a uniform information technology system developed to promote operational efficiency and uniformity among North American Coca‑Cola bottlers. As part of making the CONA System available to the Company, CONA provides certain business process and information technology services to the Company, including the planning, development, management and operation of the CONA System in connection with the Company’s direct store delivery of products (collectively, the “CONA Services”).
 
Under the CONA limited liability agreement executed January 27, 2016 (as amended or restated from time to time, the “CONA LLC Agreement”), the Company and other members of CONA are required to make capital contributions to CONA if and when approved by CONA’s board of directors, which is comprised of representatives of the members. The Company currently has the right to designate one of the members of CONA’s board of directors and has a percentage interest in CONA of approximately 19%.
 
Pursuant to the Master Services Agreement, CONA agreed to make available, and authorized the Company to use, the CONA System in connection with the distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of nonalcoholic beverages the Company is authorized to distribute under its comprehensive beverage agreements or any other agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company (the “Beverages”) in the territories the Company serves (the “Territories”), subject to the provisions of the CONA LLC Agreement and any licenses or other agreements relating to products or services provided by third-parties and used in connection with the CONA System.
 
In exchange for the Company’s right to use the CONA System and right to receive the CONA Services under the Master Services Agreement, the Company is charged quarterly service fees by CONA based on the number of physical cases of Beverages distributed by the Company during the applicable period in the Territories where the CONA Services have been implemented (the “Service Fees”). Upon the earlier of (i) all members of CONA beginning to use the CONA System in all territories in which they distribute products of The Coca‑Cola Company (excluding certain territories of CCR that are expected to be sold to bottlers that are neither members of CONA nor users of the CONA System), or (ii) December 31, 2018, the Service Fees will be changed to be an amount per physical case of Beverages distributed in any portion of the Territories equal to the aggregate costs incurred by CONA to maintain and operate the CONA System and provide the CONA Services divided by the total number of cases distributed by all of the members of CONA, subject to certain exceptions. The Company is obligated to pay the Service Fees under the Master Services Agreement even if it is not using the CONA System for all or any portion of its operations in the Territories.
 
Beverage Agreements for Legacy Territories
 
We hold numerous contracts with The Coca‑Cola Company which entitle us to produce, market and distribute The Coca‑Cola Company’s nonalcoholic beverages in bottles, cans and five gallon pressurized pre-mix containers in the Legacy Territories. We have similar arrangements with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., and other beverage companies for the Legacy Territories. 
 
We purchase concentrates from The Coca‑Cola Company to produce, market and distribute its principal sparkling beverages in the Legacy Territories under two basic forms of beverage agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company: 
 
 
(i) | beverage agreements for sparkling beverages bearing the trademark “Coca‑Cola” or “Coke” (the “Coca‑Cola Trademark Beverages” and “Cola Beverage Agreements”), and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | beverage agreements for other sparkling beverages of The Coca‑Cola Company (the “Allied Beverages” and “Allied Beverage Agreements” or collectively referred to as the “Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements”).
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company is subject to Cola Beverage Agreements and Allied Beverage Agreements for various specified Legacy Territories.
 
We also purchase finished goods and distribute certain still beverages, such as sports drinks and juice drinks, from The Coca‑Cola Company or its designees or joint ventures, and produce, market and distribute Dasani water products, pursuant to the terms of marketing and distribution agreements applicable to the Legacy Territories (the “Still Beverage Agreements”).

Cola Beverage Agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company
 
The Cola Beverage Agreements for the Legacy Territories provide that we will purchase our entire requirements of concentrates or syrups for Coca‑Cola Trademark Beverages from The Coca‑Cola Company at prices, terms of payment, and other terms and conditions of supply determined from time-to-time by The Coca‑Cola Company at its sole discretion and prohibit us from producing, distributing, or handling cola products other than those of The Coca‑Cola Company. We have the exclusive right to manufacture and distribute Coca‑Cola Trademark Beverages for sale in authorized containers in the Legacy Territories. The Coca‑Cola Company may determine, at its sole discretion, what types of containers are authorized for use with its products. The Company may not sell Coca‑Cola Trademark Beverages outside the Legacy Territories except by agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company.
 
Pursuant to the Cola Beverage Agreements, we are obligated, among other things, to:

 
 
• | maintain such plant and equipment, staff and distribution and vending facilities capable of manufacturing, packaging and distributing Coca‑Cola Trademark Beverages in accordance with the Cola Beverage Agreements and in sufficient quantities to fully satisfy the demand for these beverages in the Legacy Territories;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | undertake quality control measures and maintain sanitation standards prescribed by The Coca‑Cola Company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | develop, stimulate and fully satisfy the demand for Coca‑Cola Trademark Beverages in the Legacy Territories, and use all approved means and spend such funds on advertising and other forms of marketing as may be reasonably required to satisfy that objective; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain such sound financial capacity as may be reasonably necessary to ensure the performance of our obligations to The Coca‑Cola Company.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are required to meet annually with The Coca‑Cola Company to present our marketing, management and advertising plans for the Coca‑Cola Trademark Beverages for the upcoming year, including financial plans to evidence we have the consolidated financial capacity to perform our duties and obligations to The Coca‑Cola Company. The Coca‑Cola Company may not unreasonably withhold approval of such plans. If we carry out these plans in all material respects, we will be considered to have satisfied our obligations to develop, stimulate, and fully satisfy the demand for the Coca‑Cola Trademark Beverages and to maintain the requisite financial capacity for the period of time covered by the plan. 
 
Failure to carry out such plans in all material respects would constitute an event of default that, if not cured within 120 days of written notice of the failure, would give The Coca‑Cola Company the right to terminate the Cola Beverage Agreements. If at any time we fail to carry out a plan in all material respects in any geographic segment of the Legacy Territories, as defined by The Coca‑Cola Company, and such failure is not cured within six months of written notice of the failure, The Coca‑Cola Company may reduce the territory covered by that Cola Beverage Agreement by eliminating the portion of the territory in which such failure has occurred.
 
The Coca‑Cola Company has no obligation under the Cola Beverage Agreements to participate with us in expenditures for advertising and marketing. As it has in the past, The Coca‑Cola Company may contribute to such expenditures and undertake independent advertising and marketing activities, as well as advertising and sales promotion programs which require our mutual cooperation and financial support. The future levels of marketing funding support and promotional funds provided by The Coca‑Cola Company may vary materially from the levels provided in prior years.
 
If we acquire control, directly or indirectly, of any bottler of Coca‑Cola Trademark Beverages, or any party controlling a bottler of Coca‑Cola Trademark Beverages, we must cause the acquired bottler to amend its agreement for the Coca‑Cola Trademark Beverages to conform to the terms of the Cola Beverage Agreements.
 
The Cola Beverage Agreements are perpetual, subject to termination by The Coca‑Cola Company upon the occurrence of an event of default by the Company. If any Cola Beverage Agreement is terminated as a result of an event of default, The Coca‑Cola Company has the right to terminate all other Cola Beverage Agreements to which we are subject. Events of default with respect to each Cola Beverage Agreement include:
 
 
• | production, sale or ownership in any entity which produces or sells any cola product not authorized by The Coca‑Cola Company or any cola product that may be confused with or is an imitation of the trade dress, trademark, tradename or authorized container of a cola product of The Coca‑Cola Company;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, receivership, or the like;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | any disposition by the Company of any voting securities of any bottling company subsidiary without the consent of The Coca‑Cola Company; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any material breach of any of our obligations under such Cola Beverage Agreement remaining unresolved for 120 days after written notice by The Coca‑Cola Company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7



We are prohibited from assigning, transferring or pledging our Cola Beverage Agreements or any interest therein, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior consent of The Coca‑Cola Company.

Allied Beverage Agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company
 
The Allied Beverage Agreements contain provisions similar to those of the Cola Beverage Agreements with respect to the sale of beverages outside the Legacy Territories, authorized containers, planning, quality control, transfer restrictions and related matters, but have certain significant differences from the Cola Beverage Agreements. Pursuant to the Allied Beverage Agreements, we have exclusive rights to distribute the Allied Beverages in authorized containers in specified Legacy Territories. Similar to the Cola Beverage Agreements, we have advertising, marketing, and promotional obligations. However, under the Allied Beverage Agreements, there is no restriction for most brands as to the marketing of products with similar flavors, as long as there is no manufacturing or handling of other products imitating, infringing upon, or causing confusion with, the products of The Coca‑Cola Company. The Coca‑Cola Company has the right to discontinue any or all Allied Beverages, and the Company has a right, but not an obligation, under the Allied Beverage Agreements to elect to market any new beverage introduced by The Coca‑Cola Company under the trademarks covered by the respective Allied Beverage Agreements.
 
Allied Beverage Agreements have a term of 10 years and are renewable at our option for an additional 10 years at the end of each term. We intend to renew substantially all of the Allied Beverage Agreements as they expire. The Allied Beverage Agreements are subject to termination in the event of default by the Company. The Coca‑Cola Company may terminate an Allied Beverage Agreement in the event of:
 
 
• | insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, receivership, or the like;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | termination of a Cola Beverage Agreement by either party for any reason; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any material breach of any of our obligations under such Allied Beverage Agreement remaining unresolved for 120 days after required prior written notice by The Coca‑Cola Company.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supplementary Agreement Relating to Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements
 
The Company and The Coca‑Cola Company are parties to a Letter Agreement (the “Supplementary Agreement”) that supplements or modifies some provisions of the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements. The Supplementary Agreement provides that The Coca‑Cola Company will:

• | exercise good faith and fair dealing in its relationship with us under the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | offer marketing funding support and exercise its rights under the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements in a manner consistent with its dealings with comparable bottlers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | offer to us any written amendment to the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements, except amendments dealing with transfer of ownership, which it enters into with any other bottler in the United States subject to contracts substantially similar to the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | subject to certain limited exceptions, sell syrups and concentrates to us at prices no greater than those charged to other bottlers subject to contracts substantially similar to the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Supplementary Agreement also permits transfers of our capital stock otherwise limited by the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements.
 
Impact of Territory Conversion Agreement on Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements
 
Nearly all of our Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements are subject to being amended, restated and converted into a Final CBA (as described below) pursuant to the Territory Conversion Agreement described below, as disclosed in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 28, 2015.
Pricing of Coca‑Cola Trademark Beverages and Allied Beverages
 
In accordance with the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements, except as provided in the Supplementary Agreement and in incidence-based pricing agreements, The Coca‑Cola Company establishes the prices charged to the Company for concentrates of Coca‑Cola Trademark Beverages and Allied Beverages. The Coca‑Cola Company has no rights under the beverage agreements to establish the resale prices at which we sell its products.
 
8


Purchases of concentrate for all sparkling beverages from The Coca‑Cola Company are governed by incidence-based pricing arrangements, which are generally entered into for one- or two-year terms. Under the incidence-based pricing model, the concentrate price charged to us by The Coca‑Cola Company is impacted by a number of factors, including the incidence rate in effect, our pricing and sales of finished products, the channels in which the finished products are sold and package mix. 
 
During the one-year term of our incidence-based pricing agreement that ended on December 31, 2016, the pricing of such concentrate was governed by the incidence-based pricing model rather than the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements for the Legacy Territories. Beginning January 1, 2017, incidence-based pricing is governed by the Expanding Participating Bottler Revenue Incidence Agreement entered into with The Coca-Cola Company on September 23, 2015, as disclosed in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 28, 2015.
 
Still Beverage Agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company
 
The Still Beverage Agreements for the Legacy Territories contain provisions that are similar to the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements with respect to authorized containers, planning, quality control, transfer restrictions and related matters, but have certain material differences. Unlike the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements, which grant us exclusivity in the distribution of the covered beverages in the Legacy Territories, the Still Beverage Agreements grant exclusivity but permit The Coca‑Cola Company to test-market the still beverage products in the Legacy Territories, subject to our right of first refusal, and to sell the still beverages to commissaries for delivery to retail outlets in the Legacy Territories where still beverages are consumed on-premises, such as restaurants. The Coca‑Cola Company must pay us certain fees for lost volume, delivery, and taxes in the event of such commissary sales. 
 
Approved alternative route to market projects undertaken by the Company, The Coca‑Cola Company, and other bottlers of Coca‑Cola products would, in some instances, permit delivery of certain products of The Coca‑Cola Company into the territories of almost all bottlers, in exchange for compensation in most circumstances, despite the terms of the beverage agreements making such territories exclusive. Also, under the Still Beverage Agreements for the Legacy Territories, we may not sell other beverages in the same product category.
 
The Coca‑Cola Company, at its sole discretion, establishes the prices we must pay for the still beverages purchased as finished goods or, in the case of Dasani, the concentrate or finished goods, but has agreed, under certain circumstances for some products, to give the benefit of more favorable pricing if such pricing is offered to other bottlers of Coca‑Cola products.
 
Each Still Beverage Agreement for the Legacy Territories has a term of 10 or 15 years and is renewable at our option for an additional 10 years at the end of each term. We intend to renew substantially all of the Still Beverage Agreements as they expire.
 
Nearly all of our Still Beverage Agreements are subject to amendment, restatement and conversion into a Final CBA pursuant to the Territory Conversion Agreement, as discussed below.
 
Other Beverage Agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company
 
We have entered into a distribution agreement with Energy Brands, Inc. (“Energy Brands”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Coca‑Cola Company. Energy Brands, also known as glacéau, is a producer and distributor of branded enhanced water products including vitaminwater and smartwater, which are still beverage products. The agreement has a term of 10 years and automatically renews for succeeding 10-year terms, subject to a 12-month non-renewal notification by the Company. The agreement covers most of the Legacy Territories, requires us to distribute Energy Brands enhanced water products exclusively, and permits Energy Brands to distribute the products in some channels within the Legacy Territories. Nearly all of our agreements with Energy Brands are subject to amendment, restatement and conversion into a Final CBA pursuant to the Territory Conversion Agreement, as discussed below.
 
In June 2016, we entered into an agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR which authorizes us to market, promote, distribute and sell glacéau vitaminwater, glacéau smartwater and glacéau vitaminwater zero drops in certain geographic territories including the District of Columbia and portions of Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, beginning on January 1, 2017. This authorization shall remain valid and effective as long as the Company’s authorization to distribute such products in any other portions of its Legacy Territories remains in full force and effect under applicable bottling agreements. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company made a payment to The Coca‑Cola Company of $15.6 million on February 16, 2017, which represented a portion of the total payment made by The Coca‑Cola Company to terminate a distribution arrangement with a prior distributor in this territory. 
 
9


We also sell Coca‑Cola and other post-mix products of The Coca‑Cola Company on a non-exclusive basis. The Coca‑Cola Company establishes the prices charged to us for its post-mix products. In addition, we produce some products for sale to other Coca‑Cola bottlers and CCR. These sales have lower margins but allow us to achieve higher utilization of our production equipment and facilities.
 
Beverage Agreements with Other Licensors
 
We have beverage agreements for the Legacy Territories with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. for Dr Pepper and Sundrop brands, which are similar to the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements for the Legacy Territories. These beverage agreements are perpetual in nature but may be terminated by us upon 90 days’ notice. The price for syrup or concentrate is set by the beverage companies from time to time. These beverage agreements also contain similar restrictions on the use of trademarks, approved bottles, cans and labels and sale of imitations or substitutes, as well as termination for cause provisions. We also sell post-mix products of Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
 
We have a distribution agreement with Monster Energy Company which grants us the rights to distribute energy drink products offered, packaged and/or marketed by Monster Energy Company under the primary brand name “Monster” in the same geographic territory the Company services for the distribution of beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company.
 
The territories covered by beverage agreements with other licensors for the Legacy Territories are not always aligned with the Legacy Territories covered by the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements but are generally within those territory boundaries. Sales of beverages by the Company under these other agreements in the Legacy Territories represented approximately 12%, 13% and 13% of our bottle/can volume to retail customers for each of 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
Beverage Agreements for Expansion Territories
 
For the Expansion Territories, the Company has rights to market and distribute The Coca‑Cola Company’s nonalcoholic beverages under Comprehensive Beverage Agreements, which do not include the right to produce such beverages. The beverage agreements pertaining to the Expansion Territories are described below under the headings “Beverage Agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company for the Expansion Territories” and “Beverage Agreements with Other Licensors for the Expansion Territories.”
 
As part of these Expansion Transactions, we have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, to refrain until January 1, 2020 from acquiring or developing any line of business inside or outside of our territories governed by a Comprehensive Beverage Agreement or similar agreement without the consent of The Coca-Cola Company, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld.
 
Beverage Agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company for the Expansion Territories
 
Each principal asset purchase agreement we entered into for Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions provides for us to:
 
 
(a) | purchase from CCR (i) certain rights relating to the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of certain beverage brands not owned or licensed by The Coca‑Cola Company (“cross-licensed brands”) but then distributed by CCR in the applicable portion of the Expansion Territories and (ii) certain assets related to the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of both The Coca‑Cola Company brands and cross-licensed brands then distributed by CCR in the applicable portion of the Expansion Territories, and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | assume certain liabilities and obligations of CCR relating to the business acquired.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
At each of the closings for the Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions, the Company, CCR and The Coca‑Cola Company have entered into a comprehensive beverage agreement (“Initial CBA”) pursuant to which CCR granted us certain exclusive rights to distribute, promote, market and sell the Covered Beverages and Related Products distinguished by the Trademarks, as those terms are defined in the Initial CBAs, in the applicable portion of the Expansion Territories in exchange for us agreeing to make a quarterly sub-bottling payment to CCR on a continuing basis.
 
As of January 1, 2017, we had recorded a liability of $253.4 million to reflect the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration related to future sub-bottling payments. Each quarter, the liability to reflect the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration related to future sub-bottling payments is adjusted to fair value. See Note 3 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Other than the brands of The Coca‑Cola Company and related products and expressly permitted existing cross-licensed brands sold in an Expansion Territory, each Initial CBA provides that we will not be permitted to produce, manufacture, prepare, package, distribute, sell, deal in or otherwise use or handle any beverages, beverage components or other beverage products in the Expansion Territory unless otherwise consented to by The Coca‑Cola Company.
 
Under the Initial CBAs, we are obligated, among other things, to:
 
 
• | make capital expenditures in our business in the Expansion Territories;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | buy exclusively from The Coca‑Cola Company (directly or through CCR or another affiliate) or an authorized supplier, all beverage and related products we are authorized to distribute;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expend funds for marketing and promoting the beverage and related products we are authorized to distribute; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain certain financial capacity in order to be financially able to perform our obligations under the Initial CBAs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Each Initial CBA has a term of ten years and is automatically renewed for successive additional terms of ten years each unless we give notice to terminate at least one year prior to the expiration of a ten year term. The Initial CBA is subject to customary termination provisions by The Coca‑Cola Company, including the Company’s insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings and cross-default with other beverage agreements.
 
Pursuant to a territory conversion agreement entered into with CCR and The Coca‑Cola Company in September 2015 (the “Territory Conversion Agreement”), we have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, to amend, restate and convert all of our Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements, Still Beverage Agreements, Initial CBAs and other bottling agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company or CCR that authorize us to produce and/or distribute certain covered beverages defined in the Initial CBAs (excluding any bottling agreements with respect to the greater Lexington, Kentucky territory we received pursuant to the Asset Exchange Transaction) to a new and final form comprehensive beverage agreement (the “Final CBA” and, together with the Initial CBAs, referred to as the “CBAs” or the “Comprehensive Beverage Agreements”) in the future. 
 
The Final CBA is similar to the Initial CBA in many respects, but will include certain modifications and several new business, operational, governance and sale process provisions, including the need to obtain The Coca-Cola Company’s prior approval of a potential purchase of the Company or our aggregate businesses directly and primarily related to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of certain beverages of The Coca‑Cola Company. The Coca‑Cola Company will also have the right to terminate the Final CBA in the event of an uncured default by us.
 
At the time of the conversion of the bottling agreements for the Legacy Territories to the Final CBA, CCR will pay to us a fee in an amount equivalent to 0.5 times the EBITDA we generate from sales in the Legacy Territories of Beverages (as defined in the Final CBA) either (i) owned by The Coca‑Cola Company or licensed to The Coca‑Cola Company and sublicensed to us, or (ii) owned by or licensed to Monster Energy Company on which we pay, and The Coca‑Cola Company receives, a facilitation fee.
 
Beverage Agreements with Other Licensors for the Expansion Territories
 
We have a regional master license agreement for the Expansion Territories with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., for Dr Pepper brands. This agreement is generally similar to our beverage agreements with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. for the Legacy Territories, except it has a term of ten years, renewable at our option for an additional ten-year term. In addition, we also have the right under our distribution agreement with Monster Energy Company to distribute energy drink products offered, packaged and/or marketed by Monster Energy Company under the primary brand name “Monster” within the Expansion Territories.
Product Supply Arrangements
 
We have historically had a production arrangement with CCR to buy and sell finished products at cost. In the Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions, we continue to have, with certain exceptions, an agreement to purchase finished beverage products from CCR’s manufacturing facilities servicing customers in certain Expansion Territories at a cost-based price, subject to adjustment in accordance with our current incidence-based pricing agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company described above, as applicable to the Expansion Territory. Under certain exceptions, we may produce finished goods for our own distribution in an Expansion Territory.
Regional Manufacturing Agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company for the Expansion Territories
 
In 2016, the Company acquired Regional Manufacturing Facilities in Sandston, Virginia and Baltimore and Silver Spring, Maryland pursuant to the October 2015 APA. We are now authorized to manufacture beverages bearing trademarks of The Coca‑Cola Company using cold-fill technology at these Regional Manufacturing Facilities pursuant to an Initial Regional Manufacturing Agreement (“Initial RMA”). The Initial RMA refers to those beverages as “Authorized Covered Beverages.” 
 11



Subject to the right of The Coca‑Cola Company to terminate the Initial RMA in the event of an uncured default by the Company, the Initial RMA has a term that continues for the duration of the term of our CBAs with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR. Other than Authorized Covered Beverages, certain cross-licensed brands we are permitted to distribute under our CBAs, and certain other expressly permitted existing cross-licensed brands, the Initial RMA prohibits us from manufacturing any Beverages, Beverage Components (as such terms are defined in the form of the Initial RMA) or other beverage products at the Regional Manufacturing Facilities unless otherwise consented to by The Coca‑Cola Company.
 
Pursuant to its terms, each Initial RMA will be amended, restated and converted into a final form of regional manufacturing agreement (“Final RMA”) concurrent with the conversion of our bottling agreements to the Final CBA under the Territory Conversion Agreement. Under the Final RMA, our aggregate business directly and primarily related to the manufacture of Authorized Covered Beverages, permitted third party beverage products and other beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company will be subject to the same agreed upon sale process provisions included in the Final CBA, including the need to obtain The Coca‑Cola Company’s prior approval of a potential purchaser of such manufacturing business. The Coca‑Cola Company will have the right to terminate the Final RMA in the event of an uncured default by us. The Final RMA also will be subject to termination by The Coca‑Cola Company in the event of an uncured default by us under the Final CBA or under the NPSG Governance Agreement.

During 2016, the Company entered into two non-binding letters of intent with The Coca‑Cola Company, the February 2016 LOI and the CCR June 2016 LOI, to provide exclusive distribution rights for the Company in the following major markets: Akron, Elyria, Toledo, Willoughby, and Youngstown County, Ohio; Little Rock, West Memphis and southern Arkansas; Memphis, Tennessee, and Louisa, Kentucky.
 
The Company has entered into a non-binding letter of intent with United, the United June 2016 LOI, through which United would transfer exclusive rights and associated distribution assets and working capital in certain territory in and around Spartanburg and 
 13


Bluffton, South Carolina, currently served by United’s distribution centers located in Spartanburg, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia, in exchange for certain territory in south-central Tennessee, northwest Alabama and northwest Florida currently served by the Company’s distribution centers located in Florence, Alabama and Panama City, Florida. 
 
The Company is also a shareholder in South Atlantic Canners, Inc. (“SAC”), a manufacturing cooperative from which it is obligated to purchase 17.5 million cases of finished product on an annual basis through June 2024. SAC is located in Bishopville, South Carolina, and the Company utilizes a portion of the production capacity from the Bishopville production facility.
 
Raw Materials
 
In addition to concentrates purchased from The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies for use in our beverage manufacturing, we also purchase sweetener, carbon dioxide, plastic bottles, cans, closures and other packaging materials, as well as equipment for the production, distribution and marketing of nonalcoholic beverages.
 
We purchase substantially all of our plastic bottles, including the 12-ounce, 16-ounce, 20-ounce, 24-ounce, half-liter, 1-liter, 1.25-liter, 2-liter, 253 ml and 300 ml sizes, from manufacturing plants owned and operated by Southeastern Container and Western Container, two entities owned by various Coca-Cola bottlers, including the Company. We currently obtain all of our aluminum cans, including the 7.5-ounce, 12-ounce and 16-ounce sizes, from two domestic suppliers. None of the materials or supplies we use are currently in short supply.
 
Along with all other Coca-Cola bottlers in the United States, we are a member in Coca-Cola Bottlers’ Sales and Services Company, LLC (“CCBSS”), which was formed in 2003 to facilitate various procurement functions and the distribution of beverage products of The Coca-Cola Company with the intent of enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness of the Coca-Cola bottling system in the United States. CCBSS negotiates the procurement for the majority of our raw materials, excluding concentrate.
 
We are exposed to price risk on commodities such as aluminum, corn, PET resin (a petroleum-based product), and fuel which affects the cost of raw materials used in the production of finished products. Examples of the raw materials affected are aluminum cans and plastic bottles used for packaging and high fructose corn syrup used as a product ingredient. Further, we are exposed to commodity price risk on oil, which impacts our cost of fuel used in the movement and delivery of our products. We participate in commodity hedging and risk mitigation programs administered both by CCBSS and by the Company. In addition, no limit is placed on the price The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate.
 
Customers and Marketing
 
The Company’s products are sold and distributed through various channels, which include selling directly to retail stores and other outlets such as food markets, institutional accounts and vending machine outlets. During 2016, approximately 66% of the Company’s bottle/can volume to retail customers was sold for future consumption, while the remaining bottle/can volume to retail customers was sold for immediate consumption. All the Company’s beverage sales were to customers in the United States. The Company records delivery fees in net sales, which are used to offset a portion of the Company’s delivery and handling costs.
 
The following table summarizes the percentage of our total bottle/can volume and the percentage of our total net sales, which are all included in the Nonalcoholic Beverages operating segment, attributed to our largest customers:
 
 
 | Fiscal Year | 
-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------+---
Customer | 2016 | | | 2015
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. | | | | | | 
Approximate percent of the Company's total Bottle/can volume | | 20 | % | | 22 | %
Approximate percent of the Company's total Net sales | | 14 | % | | 15 | %
Food Lion, LLC | | | | | | 
Approximate percent of the Company's total Bottle/can volume | | 8 | % | | 7 | %
Approximate percent of the Company's total Net sales | | 5 | % | | 5 | %
The Kroger Company | | | | | | 
Approximate percent of the Company's total Bottle/can volume | | 6 | % | | 6 | %
Approximate percent of the Company's total Net sales | | 5 | % | | 5 | %

The loss of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Food Lion, LLC or The Kroger Company as a customer could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of the Company. 
 
New product introductions, packaging changes and sales promotions are the primary sales and marketing practices in the nonalcoholic beverage industry and have required and are expected to continue to require substantial expenditures. Recent product introductions from the Company and The Coca‑Cola Company include new flavor varieties within certain brands such as Fanta Sparkling Fruit, Minute Maid Refreshment, Monster, Dasani Drops, NOS, and Dasani Sparkling. New packaging introductions over the last several years include the 253 ml bottle, the 1.25-liter bottle, the 7.5-ounce sleek can, the 2-liter contour bottle for Coca‑Cola products, and the 16-ounce bottle/24-ounce bottle package.
 
We sell our products primarily in non-refillable bottles and cans, in varying proportions from market to market. For example, there may be as many as 29 different packages for Diet Coke within a single geographic area. Bottle/can volume to retail customers during 2016 was approximately 64% bottles and 36% cans.
 
Advertising in various media outlets, primarily television and radio, is relied upon extensively in the marketing of our products. The Coca‑Cola Company, Monster Energy Company and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (collectively, the “Beverage Companies”) make substantial expenditures on advertising programs in the Legacy Territories and Expansion Territories from which we have benefited. Although the Beverage Companies have provided us with marketing funding support in the past, our bottling agreements generally do not obligate the Beverages Companies to do so. Any significant curtailment of marketing funding support provided by the Beverage Companies for marketing programs which benefit us could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.
 
In addition, we expend substantial funds on our own behalf for extensive local sales promotions of our products. Historically, these expenses have been partially offset by marketing funding support provided to us by the Beverage Companies in support of a variety of marketing programs, such as point-of-sale displays and merchandising programs. The funds we expend for marketing and merchandising programs are considered necessary to maintain or increase revenue.
 
In addition to our marketing and merchandising programs, we believe a sustained and planned charitable giving program to support communities is an essential component to the success of our brand. In 2016, the Company made cash donations of approximately $8.4 million to various charities and donor-advised funds in light of the Company’s financial performance, expanded distribution territory footprint and future business prospects. The Company intends to continue its charitable contributions in future years subject to the Company’s financial performance and other business factors.
 
Seasonality
 
Business seasonality results primarily from higher unit sales of the Company’s products in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year. Sales volume can also be impacted by weather conditions. Fixed costs, such as depreciation expense, are not significantly impacted by business seasonality. We have, and believe CCR and other bottlers from whom we purchase finished goods have, adequate production capacity to meet sales demand for sparkling and still beverages during these peak periods. See “Item 2. Properties” for information relating to utilization of our production facilities.
Competition
 
The nonalcoholic beverage market is highly competitive. Competitive products include nonalcoholic sparkling beverages and still beverages, which are noncarbonated beverages such as bottled water, energy drinks, tea, ready to drink coffee, enhanced water, juices and sports drinks. Our competitors include bottlers and distributors of nationally and regionally advertised and marketed products, as well as bottlers and distributors of private label beverages. Our principal competitors include local bottlers of Pepsi-Cola and, in some regions, local bottlers of Dr Pepper, Royal Crown and/or 7‑Up products.
 
The principal methods of competition in the nonalcoholic beverage industry are point-of-sale merchandising, new product introductions, new vending and dispensing equipment, packaging changes, pricing, price promotions, product quality, retail space management, customer service, frequency of distribution and advertising. We believe we are competitive in our territories with respect to these methods of competition.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality and safety of our products, occupational health and safety practices, transportation and use of many of our products, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies of the United States.

As a manufacturer, distributor and seller of beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company and other soft drink manufacturers in exclusive territories, we are subject to antitrust laws of general applicability. However, pursuant to the United States Soft Drink Interbrand Competition Act, soft drink bottlers, such as us, may have an exclusive right to manufacture, distribute and sell a soft drink product in a defined geographic territory if that soft drink product is in substantial and effective competition with other products of the same general class in the market. We believe such competition exists in each of the exclusive geographic territories in the United States in which we operate.
 
We are required to comply with a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act; and laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools. 
 
In response to the growing health, nutrition and obesity concerns of today’s youth, a number of states have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. Restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on our products, image and reputation.
 
Most beverage products sold by the Company are classified as food or food products and are therefore eligible for purchase using supplemental nutrition assistance (“SNAP”) benefits by consumers purchasing them for home consumption. Energy drinks with a Nutrition Facts label are classified as food and are eligible for purchase for home consumption using SNAP benefits, whereas energy drinks classified as a supplement by the United States Food and Drug Administration are not. Regulators may restrict the use of benefit programs, including SNAP, to purchase certain beverages and foods.
 
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, taxes, labeling requirements or other limitations on, or regulations pertaining to, the sale of certain of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products, including certain of our products that contain added sugars or sodium, exceed a specified caloric content, or include specified ingredients such as caffeine. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted.
 
Legislation has been proposed in Congress and by certain state and local governments which would prohibit the sale of soft drink products in non-refillable bottles and cans or require a mandatory deposit as a means of encouraging the return of such containers in an attempt to reduce solid waste and litter. It is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future. We are currently not impacted by this type of proposed legislation.
 
We are also subject to national and local environmental laws, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. Our facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated on-site and sent to third-party owned and operated off-site licensed facilities.
 
Environmental Remediation
 
We do not currently have any material capital expenditure commitments for environmental compliance or environmental remediation for any of our properties. We do not believe compliance with enacted or adopted federal, state and local provisions pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or our competitive position.
Employees
 
As of January 1, 2017, we had approximately 13,200 employees, of which approximately 11,300 were full-time and 1,900 were part-time. Approximately 9% of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements.
