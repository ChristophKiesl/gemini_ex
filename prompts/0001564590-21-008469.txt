 On October 29, 2018, we separated from Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”), becoming an independent publicly traded company as a result of a pro rata distribution of our common stock to shareholders of Honeywell (the “Spin-Off”). The Spin-Off is further described in Note 1. Organization, Operations and Basis of Presentation of Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Our common stock began trading “regular way” under the ticker symbol “REZI” on the NYSE on October 29, 2018.
 Description of Business
 Resideo is a leading global manufacturer and developer of technology-driven products and solutions that provide critical comfort, residential thermal and security solutions to over 150 million homes globally. We are also the leading wholesale distributor of low-voltage security products including intrusion, access control and video products and participates significantly in the broader related markets of smart home, fire, power, audio, ProAV, networking, communications, wire and cable, enterprise connectivity, and structured wiring products. We have a global footprint serving commercial and residential end markets. Our primary focus is on the professional channel where we are a trusted partner to over 110,000 professional installers. Our global scale, breadth of product offerings, innovation heritage, and differentiated service and support has enabled our trusted relationship with professional installers and has been a key driver of our success. Leveraging our underlying strengths, we are transforming our business with a strategy that includes operational improvements, product innovation, and investments to drive future growth and value creation. We believe our large presence in the home, both on the wall and behind the wall, positions us well for the value and convenience consumers will expect out of the connected home in the future. 
 We operate in large markets that sit at the intersection of multiple secular growth trends. We believe the increased desire for critical comfort, residential thermal and security solutions in the home, combined with the long-term impacts of working from home, are driving investment in the home both in terms of time and dollars. We believe our total addressable market represents approximately a $114 billion inclusive of $27 billion for our comfort, residential thermal solutions and security, and $88 billion for distribution of low-voltage security products and additional adjacent products, including intrusion and smart home, fire, video surveillance, access control, power, audio and video, ProAV, networking, communications, wire and cable, enterprise connectivity and structured wiring. At the same time, the ability to better understand the functioning of a home through sensors, controls and connectivity has created a large and fast-growing connected home market. According to Statista, the global connected home market is expected to grow at a 16% compounded annual growth rate from $80 billion in 2019 to $195 billion in 2025. To date, we believe this market has been primarily composed of point products and services from a wide variety of industry participants, creating significant complexity for consumers. Given this complexity, we believe a significant opportunity exists to provide products, solutions and services to consumers and professional installers that integrate the disparate sensors, systems and controls inside the home, and enable differentiated insight.
 Our meaningful presence in the home derived from our broad portfolio of products and our focus on the professional installer, combined with our service-focused global distribution footprint, positions us well to take advantage of this significant market opportunity. We deliver value to our professional customers via two business

segments, Products & Solutions and ADI Global Distribution, which respectively contributed 41.8% and 58.2% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.
 Products & Solutions: Our comfort, security and energy products and solutions have a presence in over 150 million homes globally and benefit from the trusted, well-established Honeywell Home brand as well as key branded offerings such as Resideo, Braukmann, and others. Our offerings include temperature and humidity control, thermal water and air solutions, as well as security panels, sensors, peripherals, wire and cable, communications devices, video cameras, awareness solutions, cloud infrastructure, installation and maintenance tools, and related software. We are a leading player across the majority of our product categories with 15 million systems installed annually. Through our whole home presence on the wall and behind the wall, we are an enabler of home connectivity with approximately 6.7 million connected customers via our software solutions. Our connected solutions harness this data to provide control, visibility, insights, and alerts to the end user. Our comprehensive product suite has also allowed us to develop and sustain a long-standing partnership with professional installers who have relied on our selection and availability of products and configured solutions to help them succeed for over 100 years. Our broad portfolio of innovative products is delivered through a comprehensive network of over 110,000 professional contractors, more than 3,000 distributors and over 1,200 original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), as well as major retailers and online merchants.
 ADI Global Distribution: Our ADI Global Distribution segment is the leading wholesale distributor of low-voltage security products including intrusion, access control and video products, and participates significantly in the broader related markets of smart home, fire, access control, power, audio, ProAV, networking, communications, wire and cable, enterprise connectivity, and structured wiring products. Through nearly 200 stocking locations in 17 countries, ADI Global Distribution distributes more than 350,000 products from over 1,000 manufacturers to a customer base of over 100,000 contractors and is independently recognized for superior customer service. We believe this global footprint gives us distinct scale and network advantages in our core products over our competitors. Further, we believe our customers derive great value from the advice and recommendations of our knowledgeable design specialists, allowing our customers to better meet the technical and systems integration expertise requirements to install and service professional security systems. We continue to be a leader in the industry with value-added services including presales system design, 24/7 order pick-up, and the selective introduction of new product categories such as professional audio-visual.
 Our industries and markets are highly competitive in both our Products & Solutions and ADI Global Distribution segments, where we compete with global, national, regional and local providers for our products, services and solutions, including manufacturers, distributors, service providers, retailers and online commerce providers, as well as newer entrants to the market with non-traditional business and customer service models or disruptive technologies and products, including cable, telecommunications, and large technology companies competing in the connected home space.
 Factors influencing our competitive position in the industry include product and service innovation, our reputation and the reputation of our brands, sales and marketing programs, product performance, reliability and warranty, quality and breadth of product training and events, product availability, speed and accuracy of delivery, service and price, technical support, and credit availability.
 Our management team has significant experience and a track record of leading tech-enabled businesses, developing best-in-class products, and executing organizational change. This team is focused on ingraining a culture of continuous improvement into our organization with the goal of lowering costs, increasing margins and positioning the Company for growth. Leveraging the Company’s presence in the home and its relationship with professional installers, management has reorganized the Products & Solutions business to enhance focus and collaboration across business lines and segments.
 With this ongoing transformation underway, we believe we are well-positioned to execute on our growth strategy across both of our segments. Our strategy in Products & Solutions is focused on accelerating our product innovation, expanding our presence in the home and buildings, and over time, enabling connected ecosystems grounded in relationships with professional installers. Our ADI Global Distribution growth strategy is focused on increasing our omni-channel presence to grow our customer base, expanding into adjacent growth markets, and continuing to enhance our value-add services to support our professional installers’ efficiency and profitability.

Materials and Suppliers
 Purchased materials in our manufacture of products include copper, steel, aluminum, plastics, printed circuit boards, semiconductors and passive electronics. Purchased materials cover a wide range of supplier value-add, from raw materials and single components to subassemblies and complete finished goods, and there are considerable expenditures on both commercial off-the-shelf and make-to-print items. Although execution of material substitutions or supplier changes may be resource intensive, alternatives usually exist in the event that a supplier becomes unable to provide material. Unforeseen shortages and supply disruptions occur from time to time but are typically manageable such that adverse impact to customers can be avoided. Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, and catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, and impact our ability to meet commitments to customers.
Regulatory and Environmental Compliance and Regulatory Capital Expenditures
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to environmental health and safety protection standards and permitting, labeling and other requirements regarding, among other things, electronic and wireless communications, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials, remediation of environmental contamination, data privacy, consumer protection, licensing, working conditions for and compensation of our employees and others. The Company’s businesses may also be affected by changes in governmental regulation of energy efficiency and conservation standards, product safety regulations, and consumer privacy and protection regulations. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which the Company conducts its business, and changes in legislation or government policies can affect the Company’s worldwide operations, both favorably and unfavorably. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect the Company’s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 
The Company’s efforts to comply with numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations applicable to its business and products often results in capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2020, we have recorded a liability for environmental investigation and remediation of approximately $22 million related to sites owned and operated by Resideo. The Company makes capital expenditures to design and upgrade its products to comply with or exceed standards applicable to the industries in which it competes. The Company’s ongoing environmental compliance programs also results in capital expenditures. Regulatory and environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditure decisions; however, expenditures in 2020 related solely to regulatory compliance were not material. It is management’s opinion that the amount of any future capital expenditures related to compliance with any individual regulation or grouping of related regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results or competitive position in any one year. See Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further discussion of environmental matters.
 Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 14,700 employees in 32 countries. Approximately 3,100 employees were located in the United States, and the remaining 11,600 employees were located primarily in Mexico, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. Approximately 160 employees in the U.S. were subject to collective bargaining with approximately 1,270 employees outside of the U.S. subject to collective bargaining. We believe overall our relations with our workforce are good. 
 Health and Safety: The Company’s commitment to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all employees continued throughout 2020 and was further heightened by the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic, we took numerous actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, visitors and customers. These actions included formation of a response team, contact tracing and tracking of exposure and positive cases, enhanced cleaning protocols, moving to work from home where possible, suspension of most business travel and in-person meetings, the purchase of face coverings, gloves, hand sanitizer, and hand held scanning devices, installation of thermal scanners at our manufacturing sites, installation of floor demarcations and plastic shields in our ADI Global Distribution branches and on manufacturing lines, weekly internal audits, external audits of select sites, leasing of additional vans to permit distancing where we provide transportation to employees,

daily symptom self-assessments, curbside and contactless pickup in many locations, enhanced employee benefits, COVID-19 testing, and policies requiring face coverings and physical distancing.  
 At the end of 2020, our global Total Case Incident Rate (“TCIR”) (the number of occupational injuries and illnesses per 100 employees) was 0.28, significantly lower than the North American Industry Classification System injury rate for Automatic Environmental Controls of 1.7 (as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics). We monitor our safety through a balanced scorecard of key performance indicators. In addition to reactive incident management investigation and root cause analysis indicators, we measure and analyze the data generated from our hazard observation, designated Health, Safety, and Environment Internal Department (“HSE”) inspections by line managers and internal audit programs by accredited HSE lead auditors to provide insights and intelligence that help us proactively mitigate issues before they result in incidents. 
 Total Rewards: Our primary reward strategy is ensuring “pay-for-performance” on an annual basis, as well as over the long term, which drives a mindset of accountability and productivity. Our compensation guiding principles are to structure compensation that is simple, aligned and balanced. We structure and administer our Rewards programs in a manner consistent with good governance practices. We believe that the interests of employees must be aligned with our shareholders. To that end, in 2020 we launched an employee stock purchase plan and expanded the use of stock-based incentives to encourage managers to think like owners of Resideo. We provide comprehensive, competitive and contemporary benefits that recognize the diversity of our workforce and are designed to meet the varying needs of our employees and promote choice. Our package includes generous paid time off, flexible work schedules, education assistance programs and more. We believe the combination of our competitive pay-for-performance compensation programs and our comprehensive benefit programs demonstrate our commitment to a compelling total rewards value proposition for our employees. 
 In April 2020, we took the necessary steps to weather the COVID-19 crisis with several cost saving programs including temporary payroll savings, furloughs, and reduced work schedules. Where employee agreement was necessary, an overwhelming majority of employees joined their worldwide colleagues in supporting this effort to help the Company preserve business continuity. In December 2020, we announced a special year-end bonus payable to current employees who had been directly impacted by COVID-19 cost saving actions, in an amount generally comparable to the financial impact of the cost savings actions. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: In 2020, we adopted a revised Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion statement, through which we aspire to be a company where employees are empowered to bring their whole, authentic selves to work each day. We work to advance this mission by actively reaching out to people of diverse backgrounds and experiences to join our teams and nurturing an inclusive culture. We maintain employee resource groups across six categories: Women, LGBTQIA+, Black, Latino, Veterans, and People with Differing Abilities. Each group is sponsored and supported by a senior leader of the company. We encourage our hiring managers and recruiters to build a network of diverse talent. Our diversity outreach includes reaching out to all categories of diversity job boards, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities (“HBCUs”). Diversity is a key component of service level agreements we maintain with our recruiting process outsourcing (“RPO”) partners to ensure they are accountable and meet our sourcing standards. Our corporate functions and business units continue to track and report on progress with respect to our diversity and inclusion initiatives.
 Talent Acquisition, Management and Development: We have a robust recruiting model to attract all levels of talent across the regions where we operate. In 2020, our average time to fill open roles was 35 days, and we hired 6,700 employees, of which approximately 5,600 were production workers. We expanded our virtual interviewing platforms and onboarding experience to mitigate COVID-19 risk. Internally, strategic talent reviews and succession planning occur on an annual basis, globally and across all business areas.
 We strongly value feedback from our employees and launched a revised Employee Voice Survey in 2020. This survey allows each function in our company to see its ratings across three levers: Motivation, Ability, and Knowledge of Expectations. Our score for the first cycle was 7.8 on a 10-point scale, with an Employee Net Promoter score of 25 on a scale ranging from -100 to +100 (based on industry standards for Employee Net Promoter score, any score above 10 is considered good). While we are pleased with these results, there is still room for improvement, and each sub-organization has been tasked with creating an action plan based on feedback received.

RESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 
We recognize that a key facet of an effective and high performing team is the quality of the people manager. This year we introduced a new initiative, the People Manager Certification, to equip managers with an understanding of Resideo’s expectations for managers. The certification includes trainings in the skills required to be a successful manager at Resideo as well as a toolkit for managers to put learnings in action. We also encourage employees to take responsibility for their own development and provide an extensive learning library in order to ensure our people have what they need to succeed, both professionally and personally. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided training to our employees on working successfully from home and developing resiliency during this stressful time. 
 Managers and their team members participate in quarterly “Pulse” conversations to set performance expectations and monitor and evaluate performance. People managers at Resideo are strongly encouraged to give frequent, informal feedback so that employees are always clear on their performance level. In supporting our employees’ development, we refined our global mentorship program, which supports employees across all levels and functions. The program allows for multiple forms of interaction, including one-on-one relationships and "fireside chats," which improve knowledge transfer and skill development throughout the organization. 
 Seasonality
 Our Products & Solutions business experiences a moderate level of seasonality. Sales activity is generally highest in the fall and early winter months, with the highest sales at the end of the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter in the majority of our geographical markets.
Research and Development and Intellectual Property
 We have software centers of excellence in Austin, Texas; Bengaluru, India; and Melville, New York, along with major product design centers in the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In addition, our laboratories are certified to meet various industry standards, such as FCC and UL, enabling us to test and certify products internally. We also have a user experience design group that consists of researchers and product and user experience designers aligned with development sites with the primary studios in Golden Valley, Minnesota. As of December 31, 2020, we employed over 850 engineers. 
 
Our deep domain expertise, proprietary technology and brands are protected by a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements, and contractual provisions. We own approximately 2,300 worldwide active patents and pending patent applications to protect our research and development investments in new products and services. We have and will continue to protect our products and technology by asserting our intellectual property rights against third-party infringers. See Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for more information. We also have a significant trademark license with Honeywell in connection with our use of the Honeywell Home trademark as well as certain intellectual property licensed by Honeywell to us in connection with the Spin-Off. For a more detailed description of the various intellectual property rights and relationships that affect the Company’s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
