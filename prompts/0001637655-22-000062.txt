Item 1.    Business
Overview
Horizon Global Corporation, which we refer to herein as “Horizon,” “Horizon Global,” “we,” “our,” or the “Company,” became an independent, publicly traded company as the result of a tax-free spin-off (the “Spin-off”) from TriMas Corporation (“TriMas”) on June 30, 2015. The Company’s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “HZN” on July 1, 2015.
We are a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of high-quality, custom-engineered towing, trailering, cargo management and other related accessory products, operating in the North American, European and African markets, primarily servicing the aftermarket, automotive original equipment manufacturers (“automotive OEMs”) and automotive original equipment servicers (“automotive OESs”) (collectively “OEs”), retail, e-commerce and industrial channels, supporting our customers generally through a regional service and delivery model.
The Company groups its business into operating segments generally by the region in which sales and manufacturing efforts are focused. The Company has two operating segments, Horizon Americas and Horizon Europe‑Africa. Horizon Americas has operations in North America, operating in the United States, Mexico and Canada, and is generally a leader in towing and trailering-related products sold through the aftermarket, OE, retail, e-commerce and industrial channels in the geographies where it operates. Horizon Europe‑Africa focuses their sales and manufacturing efforts outside of North America. Horizon Europe‑Africa operates primarily in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Romania and South Africa. We believe Horizon Europe‑Africa is generally a leader in towing related products sold primarily through the aftermarket and OE channels in the geographies where it operates.
Our products are used in two primary categories across the world: commercial applications, or “Work,” and recreational activities, or “Play.” Some of the markets in our Work category include agricultural, automotive, construction, fleet, industrial, marine, military and municipalities. Some of the markets in our Play category include equestrian, power sports, recreational vehicle, specialty automotive, truck accessory and other specialty towing applications. We believe that the primary brands we offer are among the most recognized in the markets we serve and are known for quality, safety and performance. 
We believe no individual competitor serving the sales channels we participate in can match our broad product portfolio. Our products reach end consumers through multiple sales channels which we categorize as follows:
▪Aftermarket: This sales channel represents sales to automotive installers and warehouse distributors. In addition to selling our towing and trailering products to the aftermarket sales channel, we also sell our cargo management and “other” products to this sales channel. The cargo management product category includes a wide variety of products used to facilitate the transportation of various forms of cargo. Examples of these products include bike racks, roof cross bar systems, cargo carriers, luggage boxes, car interior protective products, loading ramps and interior travel organizers. The “other” product category includes a diverse range of items in our portfolio that do not fit into towing, trailering or cargo management categories. Examples of these products include tubular push bars, side steps, sports bars, skid plates and oil pans.
▪Automotive OEM and automotive OES: The automotive OEM sales channel represents sales to automotive vehicle manufacturers while automotive OES primarily represents sales to automotive vehicle dealerships. We primarily sell our towing products to the OEs. This product category includes devices and accessories installed on a tow-vehicle for the purpose of attaching a trailer, camper, etc., such as hitches/tow bars, fifth wheels, gooseneck hitches, weight distribution systems, brake controllers, wiring harnesses, draw bars, ball mounts, crossbars, security and other towing accessories.
▪Retail: This sales channel represents sales to direct-to-consumer retailers, such as traditional brick and mortar merchants. While we offer a majority of our products to the retail sales channel, we primarily focus on towing and cargo management products in this sales channel.
▪E-commerce: This sales channel represents sales to direct-to-consumer retailers who utilize the Internet to purchase the Company’s products. Similar to the retail sales channel, we offer a majority of our products to the e-commerce sales channel, with a focus on towing and cargo management products.
▪Industrial: This sales channel represents sales to non-automotive manufacturers and dealers of agricultural equipment, trailers and other custom assemblies. We primarily sell our trailering products to the industrial sales channel. This product category includes control devices and components of the trailer itself, such as brake controllers, jacks, winches, couplers, interior and exterior vehicle lighting and brake replacement parts.
We have positioned our product portfolio to create a variety of options based on price-point, ranging from entry-level to premium-level products across most of our markets. We believe the brands we offer in our aftermarket channel have significant customer recognition, with the three most significant being Draw-Tite®, Reese® and Westfalia®. We believe all three have substantial market share and have been leading brands in the towing market for over 50 years. These brands provide the foundation of our market position based on worldwide commercial and consumer acceptance. We also maintain a collection of regionally recognized brands that include Bulldog®, BTM, Fulton®, Reese Secure™, Reese Explorer™, Reese Power Sports, Reese Towpower™, ROLA®, Tekonsha®, WesBar® and Witter Towbar Systems.
Our Industry
Our products are sold into a diverse set of end-markets; the primary applications relate to automotive accessories for light and recreational vehicles. Purchases of automotive accessory parts are discretionary, and we believe demand is driven by macroeconomic factors including (i) employment trends, (ii) consumer sentiment and (iii) fuel prices, among others.
We believe each of these metrics impact both our Work- and Play-related sales. In addition, we believe the Play-related sales are more sensitive to changes in these macroeconomic factors, given the Play-related sales tend to be more directly related to disposable income levels.
Aftermarket, Retail and E-Commerce Channels
We sell our products in these sales channels to a wide range of customers, including national and regional distributors, installers, and both traditional brick and mortar and e-commerce merchants, including automotive, home hardware, farm and fleet, and mass merchants. More recent trends in these sales channels include:
▪Channel Consolidation: In the more mature market of the United States, there has been increasing consolidation in distribution networks with larger, more sophisticated aftermarket distributors and retailers gaining market share. In kind, these distributors generally require larger, more sophisticated suppliers with product expertise, category management and supply chain services and capabilities, as well as a global manufacturing and services footprint. We provide customers in this category the opportunity to rationalize their supply base of vendors in our product lines by virtue of our broad offering and product expertise; and
▪Growth of Online Capabilities: The ability to reach consumers directly through online capabilities, including e-commerce, is having an increasing impact on the global automotive aftermarket and retail channels. Establishment of a robust online presence is critical for suppliers regardless of whether or not they participate directly in e-commerce. We believe we are positioned well to take advantage of this continuing trend through our established online presence combined with our market leading brands. We support consumers by offering a wide range of information on our products and services, including installation videos, custom-fit guides and links to authorized dealers and both brick and mortar and e-commerce merchants.
OE and Industrial Channels
While OE and industrial channel demand is typically driven by planned production, suppliers also grow by increasing their product content on each unit produced through sales of existing product lines or expansion into new product line offerings. Given more recent trends of consolidation and globalization throughout the industry, suppliers combining a global presence with strong engineering, technology, manufacturing, supply chain and customer support will be best positioned to take advantage of OE and industrial business opportunities. 
More recent trends in the global OE and industrial supplier market include:
▪Global Platform/Supplier Consolidation: OEs continue to adopt global vehicle platforms to decrease product development costs and increase manufacturing efficiency and profitability. As a result, OEs may select suppliers with 
capacity to manufacture and deliver products on a global basis as well as the flexibility to adapt products to local variations. Suppliers with a global supply chain and efficient manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend. We believe we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend as a result of our strategic manufacturing footprint, highly developed supply chain relationships and track record of success in solving application challenges in our product lines;
▪Outsourcing of Design and Manufacturing of Vehicle Parts and Systems: OEs continually strive to simplify their assembly processes, lower costs and reduce development times. As a result, they have increasingly relied on suppliers to perform many of the design, engineering, research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by OEs. Suppliers with extensive design and engineering capabilities are in the best position to benefit from this trend as they are able to offer value-added solutions with superior features and convenience. We believe certain OEs have sought us out to assist with their engineering challenges to increase towing capacity and for the many solutions provided by our existing products; and
▪Shorter Product Development Cycles: Due to frequent shifts in government regulations and customer preferences, OEs are requiring suppliers to continue to provide new designs and product innovations. These trends are prevalent in mature markets as well as, emerging markets, which are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets. Suppliers with strong technologies, robust engineering and development capabilities are best positioned to meet OE demands for rapid innovation. Our broad product offerings, product expertise, and strategic engineering footprint enables us to rapidly deploy solutions meeting the changing customer needs.
Competitive Strengths
We believe our operating segments share and benefit from the following competitive strengths:
▪Diverse Product Portfolio of Market Leading Brands. We believe we benefit from a diverse portfolio of high-quality and highly-engineered products sold under globally recognized and market leading brand names. By offering a wide range of products, we are able to provide a complete solution to satisfy our customers’ towing, trailering and cargo management needs, as well as serve diverse channels through effective brand management. Our brands are well-known in their respective product areas and channels. We believe we are among the leading suppliers of towing and trailering products in the markets we serve. 
▪Global Scale with Flexible Manufacturing Footprint and Supply Chain. We were built through internal growth and a series of acquisitions to become an automotive accessories company with a broad range of products. Our sourcing arrangements with third-party suppliers provides us with the ability to manufacture or source high-volume products as end-market demand fluctuates, while also providing us the flexibility to produce low-volume and customized products throughout our strategically located manufacturing facilities. Our flexible manufacturing capability, low-cost manufacturing facilities and established supply chain allow us to quickly and efficiently respond to changes in end-market demand.
▪Long-Term Relationships with a Diverse Customer Base. Our customers encompass a broad range of OEs, mass merchants, e-commerce websites, distributors, dealers, and independent installers, representing multiple channels reaching the end consumer. Blue chip customers include Ford Motor Company, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Tractor Supply Company, AutoZone, O’Reilly Auto Parts, Canadian Tire, Amazon, Etrailer, LKQ, U-Haul and Redneck Trailer Supplies, among others. Our customer relationships are well established, with many exceeding 20 years. These strong partnerships can provide stability to our revenue base through economic cycles. We believe our diverse product portfolio, global scale and flexible manufacturing capabilities enable us to provide a unique value proposition to customers. 
▪Globally Competitive Cost Structure. We are consistently focused on margin improvement activities, identifying and acting on projects to reduce our cost structure. We believe our focused, identifiable projects that are under way or complete, our strong brand names, leading market position, and flexible manufacturing and sourcing operations will yield improved operating margins and cash flow that can then be deployed to high-value creation activities.
Key Business Priorities
Horizon Global established the following strategic platforms for value creation focused on business improvement and transformation, supported by a company culture of continuous improvement.
•Margin Expansion. Our first priority is to drive the organization to an operating margin that is competitive with or above industry expectations. We believe the investments made in our facilities and equipment over the past few years, along with our efforts to realign and rebalance our operations, should provide the foundation for additional margin expansion. We are an organization in which our team members are focused on constantly improving the efficiency of all operations through the adoption of lean and continuous improvement practices.
•Liquidity Management. Our second priority is to continue to effectively manage the liquidity of the business. We believe the recently completed refinancing activities and resulting improved capital structure have positioned us to meet the liquidity needs of the business with a focus on working capital management and cash flow generation, while servicing our debt obligations.
•Organic Growth.     Our third priority is to grow the business organically. We have identified areas of focused growth activities, including involving geographic markets, new customers in the sales channels we service and product line expansion, which we believe are particularly aligned with our competitive strengths.
Growth Strategies
We believe we have multiple opportunities to integrate, improve and grow our business, whether via organic initiatives, via new geographies or new product development, through the following strategies:
•Balanced Aftermarket and Original Equipment Growth. The global market for accessories and vehicle personalization is increasing across channels. The Company is positioned to balance its OE growth with growth in the aftermarket as we have significant brand recognition and strategic distributor and customer relationships. We believe that our significant brand recognition in the marketplace will allow us to support profitable organic growth to meet customer demand in the aftermarket channel. Further, automotive manufacturers are looking for suppliers to partner with to create genuine accessories to meet this need. Historically, this has been undertaken as a regional effort, but the growth of global OE programs may increase the need for global suppliers. Our geographic footprint, existing customer relationships and the potential for growth in global vehicle platforms align to present us with unique opportunities to grow with our OE customers.
•E-commerce. We will continue to leverage the breadth of our product portfolio and global manufacturing footprint by continuing to expand our presence in the high growth e-commerce channel. This strategy is applicable in our developed markets where a focus on content delivery and customer support drive growth. It is also a powerful tool as we look at developing new, less mature markets around the world, enabling a direct connection with the users of our product set.
•Low Cost Countries. We believe our manufacturing presence in Mexico and Eastern Europe, coupled with our strategic distribution network provides opportunities for growth, while supporting both new and existing global and regional customers in a cost-effective manner across our sales channels. When leveraged appropriately, it allows us to manufacture and distribute our products in a localized and regionalized manner efficiently and supports having the right product in the right place to best serve customer and end market needs.
•Product Innovation. Our presence in the OE channels and multiple geographic markets allows us to leverage development costs and product innovation tied to new vehicles across our entire geographic footprint. We aim to be first to market in the aftermarket with our historical success of leveraging our OE innovation into the aftermarket channel, which supports profitable organic growth.
Marketing, Customers and Distribution
Horizon employs a dedicated sales force in each of our primary channels. In serving our customers globally, we rely upon our strong historical customer relationships, custom engineering capability, brand recognition, broad product offerings, our established distribution network and varied merchandising strategies to bolster our towing, trailering, cargo management and accessory product sales. No customer represented greater than 10% of total net sales during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Competition
The competitive environment for automotive accessory products is highly fragmented and is characterized by numerous smaller suppliers, even the largest of which tend to focus in narrow product categories. We believe there is no individual competitor that has the breadth of product portfolio in the markets we serve. Significant towing competitors include LCI Industries, B&W Trailer Hitches, Husky Towing Products, Winston Products, ACPS Automotive, ALKO Group, Buyers Products Company, Demco Products, PullRite, Westin Automotive Products and Camco. Significant trailering competitors include Pacific Rim, Dutton-Lainson, SAF-Holland, Demco Products, Jost International and Sea-Sense. In addition, competitors in the cargo management product category include Thule, Yakima, Bell, Masterlock and Saris.
Materials and Supply Arrangements
We procure a variety of materials from a global supplier base from around the world. We are sensitive to price movements in our raw materials supply base. Our largest material purchases are for steel, copper, and aluminum. We also consume a significant amount of energy via utilities in our facilities. Historically, when we have experienced increasing costs of steel, we have successfully passed those through to our customers, although sometimes with a delay due to competitive pressure. Refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional information. 
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,800 people, of which approximately 13% were located in the United States. In the United States, we have no collective bargaining agreements. In June 2020, the Company successfully completed a three-year agreement with our largest union in Horizon Europe‑Africa. Globally, employee relations have generally been satisfactory. We cannot predict the impact of any future unionization of our workplace.
Horizon Global focuses on a number of human capital resources objectives in managing its business, including our commitment to safety, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, and talent development. These human capital resources objectives, taken together, may be material to understanding our business under certain circumstances. These objectives are reinforced by our code of conduct, The Spirit and the Letter, our global policies, and our commitment to sustainability as evidenced in our 2021 Sustainability Report.
Commitment to Safety
One of our primary objectives is the health and safety of our employees and anyone who conducts business on our behalf. The commitment to safety starts at the top levels of our organization. We believe a safe and secure workplace is fundamental and important to our success. Horizon Global is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace, and complying with applicable safety and health laws, regulations and internal requirements. We are also committed to engaging our employees to continually improve health and safety by acting upon opportunities to reduce risk and improve our safety and health performance. Horizon Global maintains comprehensive safety programs focused on identifying hazards and eliminating risks that can lead to severe injuries.
The Company prioritizes the health of its employees and others in the communities where it does business and continues to take appropriate measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, including providing information resources, leveraging remote work for certain administrative employees, requiring the use of personal protective equipment by all employees during working hours and requiring essential on-site employees to practice social distancing. 
Employee Engagement
The Company maintains a commitment to continuous improvement as one of our core values and is imperative to our long-term business strategies and initiatives. We embrace lean manufacturing principles, such as Kaizen, and work to foster a culture of employee engagement to drive performance improvements and operational excellence.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe we are at our best when we bring together unique perspectives, experiences and ideas, and actively build diverse teams and inclusive work environments across our global locations. We believe that tapping into our employees’ diverse backgrounds and experiences ensures we make better decisions and supports stronger operating performance. Our goal is to foster working environments that are fair and safe, where rights are respected and everyone can achieve their full potential. Our policies and practices strive to assure equal employment and advancement opportunities for all qualified people. We also work to maintain appropriate standards of conduct in the workplace and to be sensitive to the concerns of our diverse group of employees. We strive to maintain workplaces that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, age, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, protected veteran status, disability or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.
Talent Development
We believe that a talented, engaged and dynamic workforce is vital to our success. We seek to hire, develop and retain individuals who embrace and thrive in our culture. Our culture is grounded in our values: Socially Responsible, Respectful & Open Team, Integrity & Accountability and Data & Results Driven. Our business strives to build a dynamic talent pipeline through robust recruitment initiatives across our operating footprint. Our programs are intended to ensure seamless onboarding for our new employees. We identify and nurture talent through a culture designed to enable employees to succeed and grow into leadership positions. We believe our business and structure provide opportunities for employees to follow their own path and advance their careers.
We support a culture of continuous growth and development, and we provide employees with the opportunity to receive frequent performance feedback. Our employees have goals and objectives that align to both personal development and the Company’s strategic objectives. The performance management process includes performance and career development discussions between employees and their managers (via annual goal setting and year-end performance and talent reviews). During this process, employees receive candid feedback on their performance against established goals and objectives. These reviews evaluate each employee’s strengths, skills, areas for opportunity and growth, which are important for career development.
Seasonality
We experience some seasonality in our business. Sales of towing and trailering products are generally stronger in the second and third calendar quarters, as trailer OEs, distributors and retailers acquire product for the spring and summer selling seasons. In addition, within the OE channels, there is moderate seasonality due to production schedules and the launch of component production for new vehicle models, which generally occurs in the third calendar quarter of the year. Accordingly, our results reflect any seasonality we may experience.
Government Regulation
We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. international environmental, safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges and chemical and hazardous waste management and disposal. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners’ or operators’ releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require the obtainment and compliance with environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. However, the nature of our operations and our long history of industrial activities at certain of our current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities.
While we must comply with existing and pending climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties or accords, current laws and regulations have not had a material impact on our business, capital expenditures or financial position. Future events, including those relating to climate change or greenhouse gas regulation could require us to incur expenses related to the modification or curtailment of operations, installation of pollution control equipment or investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites.
In addition to environmental laws and regulations, our operations are governed by variety of laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations thereunder. Although we cannot provide assurance that at all times we are compliant, we believe that we are in compliance with these laws and regulations. In addition, we do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
International Operations
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 43.2% of our net sales were derived outside of the United States. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, 65.4% of our consolidated property and equipment, net were located outside of the United States. We operate manufacturing facilities in France, Germany, Mexico, Romania and South Africa.
