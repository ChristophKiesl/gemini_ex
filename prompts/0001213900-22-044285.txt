Item 1. Business Introduction
Our Core Business



Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (“Kandi Technologies”) is a Delaware holding company, with its common stock being traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. As a holding company with no material operations of its own, a substantial majority of the operations are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries established in the People’s Republic of China, or the PRC, including Zhejiang Kandi Technologies Group, Co. Ltd. (“Zhejiang Kandi Technologies”) and U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries SC Autosports, LLC (“SC Autosports”) and their subsidiaries. 



Originally, the Company’s primary business operations consist of designing, developing, manufacturing and commercializing electric vehicle (“EV”) products and EV parts. However, in recent years, some EV enterprises in China are seizing market share at the cost of huge losses. The Company gradually realized that the EV market of China has not reached a healthy and orderly development stage. Therefore, with our financial condition, it is unwise to participate in this “loss competition” at this stage. The Company always firmly believes that only with the maturity of changing-battery-model can EV be truly popularized. Since the Company has advanced EV intelligent battery swap equipment, manufacturing capacity of EV with intelligent battery swap mode and dozens of patented technologies in battery swap, the Company will continue to improve and perfect in the field of online car hailing with battery swap mode, and will make full efforts when the EV market of China enters a healthy and orderly development stage. Now with the global trend of “fuel to electrification” of off-road vehicles becoming more and more obvious and huge market demand, in 2022, our PRC entities, including Zhejiang Kandi Technologies, Kandi Hainan and Hainan Kandi Holding will apply EV technology to off-road vehicle products and launch a variety of pure electric utility vehicles (“UTV”), Neighborhood EVs (“NEVs”), Golf carts and off-road crossover vehicles. We will fully enter the off-road vehicle market utilizing the high-end technology that accumulated by Kandi in the field of EVs over the past years, and strive to achieve a leading position in this field in China within three years.


The Company does not believe that our major business is within the targeted areas of concern by the Chinese government. However, Kandi Technologies is a holding company in Delaware and our majority of business is conducted through the Company’s subsidiaries and pre-existed VIE in the PRC and its operations there. Therefore, there is a risk that the Chinese government may in the future seek to affect operations of any company with any level of operations in the PRC, including its ability to offer securities to investors, list its securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange, conduct its business or accept foreign investment. Additionally, we are subject to certain legal and operational risks associated with our operations in China. PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are uncertain, and therefore, these risks may result in a material change in the Company’s operations, significant depreciation of the value of our common stock, or a complete hindrance of our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors. Due to the fact that PRC does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with the United States and many other countries and regions, direct recognition and enforcement in PRC of judgments of a court in any of these non-PRC jurisdictions in relation to any matter not subject to a binding arbitration provision may be difficult, time-consuming, costly or even impossible, the investors may even need to sue again in one of the courts under PRC jurisdiction. Therefore, our investors may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing judgements or bringing original actions based on United States or foreign laws against us or our management. Changes in currency conversion policies in China and fluctuation in exchange rates may also have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our securities. During the previous few decades, the economy of China had experienced unprecedented growth. This growth has slowed in the recent years, and if the growth of the economy continues to slow or if the economy contracts, our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. Since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact of such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. For a more detailed description of the risks regarding our business structure, please see “Risks Related to Doing Business in China” in pages 22-28. It is still unclear about the scope and the impact of these new regulations, however, these risks could result in a material change in the value of our securities or cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless.

Our Organizational Structure



The Company’s organizational chart as of the date of this report is as follows:






Please refer to the discussion in NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report for a narrative of our organization structure and operating subsidiaries, including their dates of incorporation and history.
Industry Overview



Over the years, governments and the automobile manufacturing industry have reached a consensus on the importance of diversifying the automobile industry and utilizing various energy resources. China is one of the world’s largest automobile markets. China has relatively scarce fuel reserves but rich natural resources of electric power. As a result, the Chinese government has been implementing industrial policies of supporting new energy vehicles. The diversified market with the coexistence of traditional fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles and pure electric vehicles has been initially formed. The Company believes China is a huge prospective market for pure electric vehicles. The Company also believes that in the global automobile industry, there is great development space for the Chinese electric vehicles and their core parts industry in the future. In addition, with the global trend of “fuel to electrification” of off-road vehicles becoming more and more obvious and huge market demand, management believes this industry still has huge development space.

Competitive Landscape



In general, the EV and electric off-road vehicles business faces competition from two groups of competitors: traditional vehicle manufacturers and new market entrants.



In terms of competition with conventional fuel vehicle and off-road vehicles manufacturers, many of the conventional fuel vehicle manufacturers are much larger in terms of size, manufacturing capabilities, customer bases, financial, marketing and human resources than the electric vehicle and electric off-road vehicles manufacturers. However, the conventional fuel vehicles and off-road vehicles face many challenges, including but not limited to environmental pollution and energy scarcity, which in turn provide great opportunities for the rapid development of the EV and electric off-road vehicles industry.
Our Opportunities and Growth Strategy



Due to worsening air pollution and concerns about petroleum resource dependence, the new energy industry is developing vigorously. Given its technology innovation with integrated solutions and operation experience, Kandi has benefited from the development of EV and electric off-road vehicles industry.



The Company’s business strategy includes efforts to provide customers with high-quality products, to expand the footprint in new and existing markets, and to advance our profile and the market demand through the further innovations. The Company also provides products to end users through our distributors.



Today, cities in China face four critical challenges in the traffic environment, including pollution, traffic congestion, insufficient parking availability and growing scarcity of energy supplies, which are mainly the result of ever growing volume of gas-powered private cars. The best solution to these problems is to increase more affordable public transportation for urban residents. Subway and bus used to be the most popular public transportation options in China. They form the main artery of urban public transportation but such system is lack of capillary. In this regard, we introduced the Car-Share Program by using pure electric vehicles. Urban public transportation system can be improved with the online ride-sharing program (“Online Ride-Sharing Program”).



In order to create an ecosphere of EV changing-battery-model, on October 22, 2020, the Company entered into a strategic agreement with Zhejiang State Grid Electric Vehicle Service Company. The two parties will cooperate extensively across the whole supply chain for electric vehicle-battery exchange. This in-depth collaboration will focus on the following areas: centralized constant temperature battery charging, distribution, maintenance, battery recycling, construction and operation of power exchange networks, power exchange services to meet energy demand, grid auxiliary services, flexible control of power load exchange, as well as other value-added services for power exchange stations. The two parties will first start their collaboration in the project of “300,000 government-accredited ride-sharing vehicles within 5 years” (the “Online Ride-Sharing Project”) initiated by Kandi, and then expand into new areas of cooperation based on the progress in this collaboration. Now the Online Ride-Sharing Project is operated by Ruiheng, the investee of Zhejiang Kandi Technologies. Currently, there are two modes of car-share programs in the market. One is that a car rental service provider offers its cars at certain locations, and customers can pick up cars at these locations by themselves. The other mode is that a service provider will deliver cars to the customers pursuant to their need and request made through the service provider’s network platform. A service provider will provide pick-up service with a driver, commonly known as the online ride-sharing service program. Now online ride-sharing service program is one of the most active sharing economy models in China. The innovative business model of the five-year 300,000 units online ride-sharing service program initiated by us provides an excellent solution to EV sharing. The character of this program is that all the cars casted to the online platform use the changing battery model, which solves problems including high price of EVs, short recharging mileage, long recharging time, shortage of charging facilities, battery attenuation and potential pollution problem. Furthermore this model allows the battery to be slowly recharged at a constant temperature, which prolongs the usage life of the battery and realize green energy efficiency We believe that this upgrade to Online Ride-Sharing Program from MPT (“Micro Public Transportation”) advocated and practiced by Kandi do have the opportunity to become the benchmark of urban car-share and play a significant role in the development of EV changing-battery-model ecosphere in the future.



SC Autosports is a Dallas-based sales company with nationwide sales channels in the U.S that is primarily engaged in the wholesale of off-road vehicle products, with a small percentage of its business derived from wholesale and retail of off-road vehicle parts. It has a seasoned management team and a distribution force averaging over ten years of sales experience. Kandi Technologies acquired 100% ownership of SC Autosports on July 1, 2018.



On July 13, 2021, Kandi, through Zhejiang Kandi Technologies, entered into (i) a Share Transfer Agreement (the “Share Transfer Agreement”) with Liao Zongjiang, Liao Chunsheng, and Liao Caijin, three individual shareholders of Jiangxi Huiyi, as defined below (the “Transferors”) and (ii) a Supplementary Agreement (the “Supplementary Agreement”) with the Transferors, pursuant to which Zhejiang Kandi Technologies acquired all the equity interests of Jiangxi Huiyi for a purchase price of RMB 50 million (approximately $7.7 million) in cash by installments to the Transferors. In addition, the Transferors may receive additional restricted stock upon Jiangxi Huiyi’s achievement of certain milestones.

Sales and Distribution



Because our products are manufactured in China, there are two major sales modes of our products sold to the countries and regions other than China market: the first mode is indirect sales to Chinese import and export trading companies for sales to the countries and regions out of China, and the second is direct sales to foreign dealers to export the products manufactured in China to the countries and regions out of China. Our products sold in China are mainly through our sales department to sign sales contracts directly with customers.



Currently, K23 model is applying for manufacture license. If it goes smoothly, it is expected that the manufacture license will be granted at the end of the second quarter of 2022. After receiving the manufacture license, K23 model can be then delivered into the Chinese market.

During 2020, SC Autosports received the required clearance from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its two electric vehicle (EV) models – the K23 and K27 – via Certificates of Conformity. However, until now, the airbags of the products have not met the technical requirements of the United States. Therefore, the launch time of the above-mentioned two products in the United States is still uncertain. Currently, the low-speed versions (NEV) of K23 and K27, which are specifically designed for the U.S. market have met the relevant requirements in the United States, and now have gradually begun to be delivered to customers. The prototypes of our UTV K32 were delivered to SC Autosports for dealers to review and provide feedback. The initial feedback was positive with some suggestions. Kandi Hainan has made improvement based on the suggestions and plan to deliver first batch of K32 in the late first quarter of 2022. Since the beginning of 2021, SC AutoSports has been signing up and delivering NEV to Kandi’s dealers. The potential buyers can reserve a NEV K23 or K27 by paying a fully unconditionally refundable $100 deposit on our website. Once SC AutoSports receives the reservation fee and request, it will pass the reservation to dealers, who will then contact the potential buyers to complete the purchase process, the completion of which is subject to which payment method the buyers may utilize and the approval of a bank if a loan is needed. Regarding the latest model off-road UTV K32, similar to NEV K23 and K27, SC AutoSports is taking reservations made through its website and plans to deliver first batch of K32 to dealers in the late first quarter of 2022. Please be advised that that SC AutoSports is using online reservations as a lead generator for our dealerships. The final sales will be completed by our dealers. The prototypes shown on our website on the website will be the final models for delivery. Currently SC Autosports sells through the authorized dealers covering more than thirty states, from western coast to eastern coast in the U.S. for its NEV and off-road vehicles. SC Autosports also sells parts and youth vehicles on its website www.partsBoss.com.

As of the date of this report, we have completed the conversion of Kandi New Energy to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zhejiang Kandi Technologies, effective March 14, 2022. Therefore, we have 100% control and ownership of our subsidiaries. There is no limitation or restriction imposed by the regulations regarding fund transfer within companies. Our cash management policy basically is to allocate the cash resources based on the needs and projection of each subsidiary within the Company group. Although the purpose of all transfers needs to be business operation-related, there is no strict limitation on how much cash can be transferred, because the Company treats all subsidiaries as a whole group under the Company’s policy of the fund transfer. The cash transfer is requested when needed and approved by authorized persons based on the amount of cash transfer.



Environmental and Safety Regulation



Emissions



Our products are all subject to international laws and emissions related standards and regulations, including regulations and related standards established by China Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the California Air Resources Board, and European and Canadian legislative bodies.



According to the management’s knowledge, the Company’s products have been designed and developed according to the environmental regulations of the target market since the research and development period, and have passed the corresponding tests before the products are put into production and sales, and obtained the compulsory product certification of the corresponding countries and regions.



If the standards and rules are modified, or interpreted differently, or the product certification certificate expires, the Company will evaluate the product and restart the corresponding product design improvement and product testing/certification procedures to continuously ensure the target market environment regulatory compliance. The Company cannot estimate the extent to which these changes, if any, will affect our operating costs in the future.



Product Safety and Regulation



Safety Regulation



The U.S. federal government and individual states have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations relating to the use and safety of Kandi’s products. The federal government is the primary regulator of product safety. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to ATVs and off-road vehicles. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to off-road vehicles and regulates the safety of electric vehicles for road vehicles.





11







In August 2008, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (the “Product Safety Act”) was passed. The Product Safety Act requires all manufacturers and distributors who import into or distribute ATVs within the United States to comply with the American National Standards Institute/Specialty Vehicle Institute of America (“ANSI/SVIA”) safety standard, which previously had been voluntary. The Product Safety Act also requires the same manufacturers and distributors to have ATV action plans filed with the CPSC that are substantially similar to the voluntary action plans that were previously in effect. Both Kandi and SC Autosports currently comply with the ANSI/SVIA standard.



Kandi’s off-road vehicles are subject to federal vehicle safety standards administered by NHTSA. Kandi’s off-road vehicles are also subject to various state vehicle safety standards. Kandi believes that its off-road vehicles comply with safety standards applicable to off-road vehicles.



Kandi’s off-road vehicles are also subject to international safety standards in places where it sells its products outside the United States. Kandi believes that its off-road vehicle products comply with applicable safety standards in the United States and internationally.



SC Autosports has received the required clearance from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its two electric vehicle (EV) models, the K23 and K27 via Certificates of Conformity. We performed self-inspection comparing to the safety standards published by the United States Department of Transportation. However, until now, the airbags of the products have not met the technical requirements of the United States. Therefore, We are also in the process of modifying features, upgrading the software and technology to cater for our potential U.S. customers. Currently, the low-speed versions (NEV) of K23 and K27, which are specifically designed for the U.S. market have met the relevant requirements in the United States.

Those listed above constitute all the requisite permissions or approvals the Company and its subsidiaries required to operate business. The Company and its subsidiaries have never been denied any applications concerning any permissions or approvals. If the Company or its subsidiaries does not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals, or mistakenly conclude that such permissions or approvals are not required, our business may be adversely affected. In the scenario when the Company does get denied such permissions, the Company would either avoid such field of business, or collaborate with parties that can obtain such permissions. Currently the PRC legal system is under constant development and applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations are subject to substantial uncertainties. If relevant rules suddenly change, we will have to obtain such permissions or approvals, which may be costly, and may temporarily halt our operation of business, negatively affecting our revenues and our securities’ value.



CAC Review


As advised by our PRC Counsel, Zhejiang Lizhou (Jinhua) Law Firm, as of the date of this report, (i) the Company does not hold personal information of over one million users; (ii) the Company and its subsidiaries have not been informed by any PRC governmental authority of any requirement that it file for a cybersecurity review; and (iii) the Company and its subsidiaries have never disclosed any customer or supplier information within China (except when requested by related parties, the company and its subsidiaries tailor their customer or supplier information disclosures to the narrowest possible scope), therefore, the Company believes it is not required to pass cybersecurity review of CAC. We are also not aware that there are relevant laws or regulations in the PRC explicitly requiring us to seek approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission for our overseas listing. Further, as of the date of this report, Kandi Technologies and its subsidiaries 1) did not collect any data that will or may negatively influence PRC’s national security; and 2) strictly follow the relevant PRC laws and regulations. Since these statements and regulatory actions are new, however, official guidance and related implementation rules have not been issued. It is highly uncertain what the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on the daily business operations of our subsidiaries, our ability to accept foreign investments, and our listing on a U.S. exchange. The PRC regulatory authorities may in the future promulgate laws, regulations, or implementing rules that require us, our subsidiaries to obtain regulatory approval from Chinese authorities for listing in the U.S. If we do not receive or maintain the approval, or inadvertently conclude that such approval is not required, or applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change such that we are required to obtain approval in the future, we may be subject to an investigation by competent regulators, fines or penalties, or an order prohibiting us from conducting an offering, and these risks could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our common stock, significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, or cause such securities to significantly decline in value or become worthless.




Auditors’ Regulations



As auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, our auditor is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, to the extent that our auditor’s work papers become located in China, such work papers will not be subject to inspection by the PCAOB because the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities. Inspections of certain other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms’ audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. We are required by the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“HFCAA”) to have an auditor that is subject to the inspection by the PCAOB. While our present auditor is located in the United States and the PCAOB is able to conduct inspections on such auditor, to the extent this status changes in the future and our auditor’s audit documentation related to their audit reports for our company becomes outside of the inspection by the PCAOB or if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditor because of a position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction, trading in our common stock could be prohibited under the HFCAA, and as a result our common stock could be delisted from Nasdaq.



On May 13, 2021, the PCAOB proposed a new rule for implementing the HFCAA. Among other things, the proposed rule provides a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, under the HFCAA, whether it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction. The proposed rule would also establish the manner of the PCAOB’s determinations; the factors the PCAOB will evaluate and the documents and information it will consider when assessing whether a determination is warranted; the form, public availability, effective date, and duration of such determinations; and the process by which the board of the PCAOB can modify or vacate its determinations. The proposed rule was adopted by the PCAOB on September 22, 2021 and approved by the SEC on November 5, 2021.





13







Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“AHFCAA”), which, if enacted, would amend the HFCAA and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three, thus reducing the time period for triggering the prohibition on trading.



While the HFCAA is not currently applicable to the Company because the Company’s current auditors are subject to PCAOB review, if this changes in the future for any reason, the Company may be subject to the HFCAA. The implications of this regulation if the Company were to become subject to it are uncertain. Such uncertainty could cause the market price of our common stock to be materially and adversely affected, and our securities could be delisted or prohibited from being traded on Nasdaq earlier than would be required by the HFCAA. If our common stock is unable to be listed on another securities exchange by then, such a delisting would substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase the common stock when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with a potential delisting would have a negative impact on the price of the common stock.



Principal Executive Offices



Our principal executive office is located in the Jinhua New Energy Vehicle Town in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province, PRC, 321016, and our telephone number is (86-579) 82239856.



Enforceability of civil liabilities against foreign persons



We have our principal executive office and substantially all of our operations in PRC. A majority of our directors and officers are nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for our shareholders to effect service of process upon us or those persons inside PRC. The shareholders may have to rely on international treaties such as Hague Service Convention for service. In addition, PRC does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with the United States and many other countries and regions. Therefore, direct recognition and enforcement in PRC of judgments of a court in any such non-PRC jurisdictions in relation to any matter not subject to a binding arbitration provision may be difficult, time-consuming, costly or even impossible.
Recent Development Activities



On December 28, 2021, the Company announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Jiangxi Huiyi entered mass production of its lithium iron phosphate (“LFP”) battery IFR18650-2200mAh, one of the most advanced on the global market.



On January 10, 2022, the Company announced that Zhejiang Kandi Technologies signed a framework agreement with Hunan Hengrun Automobile Co., Ltd. (“Hengrun”) to jointly produce battery-swappable pure electric vehicles. According to the agreement, Kandi and Hengrun will use their respective capabilities to jointly produce battery-swappable pure electric vehicles. The specific division of labor and cooperation content will be clarified in a separate agreement. The vehicles will be sold under the “Henghe” brand name.



Under the condition that SC Autosports purchased electric golf crossover vehicles from Jiangsu Xingchi Electric Technology Co., Ltd. (“Jiangsu Xingchi”), but Jiangsu Xingchi’s existing production capacity is far from meeting the needs of the U.S. market, in order to expand production capacity as soon as possible to meet the needs of the U.S. market, on February 15, 2022, Kandi Hainan and Jiangsu Xingchi jointly invested RMB 30,000,000 (approximately $4.6 million) in Haikou, Hainan (of which Kandi Hainan owns 66.7% and Jiangsu Xingchi owns 33.3%) to establish Hainan Kandi Holding New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (“Hainan Kandi Holding”). Hainan Kandi Holding will specialize in the production of electric golf crossover vehicles and other products in Kandi Hainan’s factory.
