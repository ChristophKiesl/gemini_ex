OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING OUR OPERATIONS
Customers
Our products are designed to provide reliable, long-lasting solutions that meet the evolving requirements and needs of our customers. The nature and extent of our commercial relationships with each of our customers are different in terms of breadth of products purchased, product volumes, length of contractual commitment, ordering patterns, inventory management, and selling prices. Contracts with customers can include rebates and tiered pricing arrangements based on pre-determined volume levels, in which higher volume levels typically have lower pricing, or fixed annual price downs that are offered to customers in exchange for increased volume levels and/or longer contract terms.  Typically, our contracts specify minimum order quantities and lead times.
- 6 -


We have limited visibility into our customers’ future purchases, covering only a relatively short period of time. Our customers may have inventory management programs, vertical integration plans and/or alternate supply arrangements that may not be communicated to or shared with us. Additionally, the relative market share among the OEM manufacturers changes periodically, which may cause customer inventory levels to rebalance to match new demand. Consequently, these and other factors can significantly impact our sales in any given period. Our customers may initiate field actions with respect to market-released products. These actions may include product recalls or communications with a significant number of physicians about a product or labeling issue. The scope of such actions can range from very minor issues affecting a small number of units to more significant actions. 
Our Medical customers include large multi-national medical device OEMs and their subsidiaries such as Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic, and Boston Scientific. Our Non-Medical customers include large multi-national OEMs and their subsidiaries serving the energy, military and environmental services markets such as Halliburton, and Baker Hughes. During 2020, sales to Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic and Boston Scientific were each in excess of 10% of total sales and collectively accounted for 48% of our total sales. We believe that the diversification of our sales among the various subsidiaries and market segments with those three customers reduces our exposure to negative developments with any one customer. The loss of a significant amount of business from any large customer or a further consolidation of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as further explained in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this report.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products directly to our customers. In 2020, approximately 56% of our products were sold in the U.S. Sales within and outside the U.S. are primarily to customers whose corporate offices are located and headquartered in the U.S. Information regarding our sales by geographic area is set forth in Note 18 “Segment and Geographic Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.
Although the majority of our customers contract with us to develop custom components and assemblies to fit their product specifications, we also provide system and device solutions ready for market distribution by OEMs. We have established close working relationships between our internal program managers and our customers. We market our products and technologies at industry meetings and trade shows domestically and internationally. We have placed additional emphasis on reaching long-term agreements with our OEM customers to secure our revenue base and incentivize growth.
Internal account executives support all sales activity and involve engineers and technology professionals in the sales process to address customer requests across all product lines. For system and device solutions, we partner with our customers’ research, marketing, and clinical groups to jointly develop technology platforms in alignment with their product roadmaps and therapy needs.
We leverage our account executives with support from our engineers to design and sell product solutions into our targeted markets. Our account executives are trained to assist our customers in selecting appropriate materials and configurations. We market our products and services through well-defined selling strategies and marketing campaigns that are customized for each of the industries we target.
Firm backlog orders at December 31, 2020 were approximately $289 million. The majority of the orders outstanding at December 31, 2020 are expected to be shipped within one year.
Competition
The MDO manufacturing industry has traditionally been highly fragmented with several thousand companies, many of which we believe have limited manufacturing capabilities and limited sales and marketing expertise. We believe that very few companies offer the scope of manufacturing capabilities and services that we provide to medical device companies, however, we may compete in the future against other companies that provide broad manufacturing capabilities and related services. We compete against different companies depending on the type of product or service offered or the geographic area served. We also face competition from existing and prospective customers that employ in-house capabilities to produce some of the products we provide.
Our existing or potential competitors include suppliers with different subsets of our manufacturing capabilities, suppliers that concentrate in niche markets, and suppliers that have, are developing, or may in the future develop, broad manufacturing capabilities and related services. We compete for new business at all phases of the product life cycle, which includes development of new products, the redesign of existing products and transfer of mature product lines to outsourced manufacturers. Competitive advantage is generally based on reputation, quality, delivery, responsiveness, breadth of capabilities, including design and engineering support, price, customer relationships and increasingly the ability to provide complete supply chain solutions rather than only producing and providing individual components.
- 7 -


Acquisitions and Investments
One facet of our growth strategy is to acquire additional technology or manufacturing capability to expand our product offering in our key existing growth markets. We expect to continue to engage in business development activities and technology licensing arrangements to support our growth in these markets. 
As our customers grow and consolidate, they seek suppliers who can offer broad product capabilities, manufacturing scale and facilitate speed to market. Our strategy aligns with enhancing our portfolio from both organic and inorganic means to partner more broadly with our customers to support their growth. Our inorganic strategy will be primarily focused on smaller strategic “bolt-on” acquisitions that will supplement our existing product portfolio.
Research and Product Development
Our position as a leading developer and manufacturer of medical devices and components is largely the result of our long history of technological innovation. Our scientists, engineers and technicians focus on developing new products, improving and enhancing existing products, and expanding the use of our products in new or tangential applications. In addition to our internal technology and capability development efforts aimed at providing our customers with differentiated solutions, we also engage outside research institutions for unique technology projects.
Medical. We believe our core business is well positioned because our OEM customers leverage our portfolio of intellectual property. We continue to build a healthy pipeline of diverse medical technology opportunities and provide a new level of industry leading capabilities and services to our OEM customers across the full range of medical device products and services continuum. We are at the forefront of innovating technologies and products that help change the face of healthcare, enabling us to provide our customers with a distinct advantage as they bring complete medical systems and solutions to market. In turn, our customers are able to accelerate patient access to life enhancing therapies. We offer our customers a comprehensive portfolio comprising the best technologies, providing a single point of support, and driving optimal outcomes. 
Some of the more significant product development opportunities our Medical segment is pursuing are as follows:

Product Line | Product Development Projects 
Cardio & Vascular | Active projects in structural heart delivery systems subassemblies, structural heart delivery accessories, structural heart implants, electrophysiology catheters, accessories and subassemblies, peripheral vascular catheters and guidewires, neurovascular therapies to prevent hemorrhagic, neurovascular therapies to treat ischemic stroke, enhanced access introducers, gastrointestinal scope components, fractional flow reserve guidewire subassemblies, sensor-enabled catheters and guidewires, and oncology catheters. Technology investments to enable our customer’s catheter, delivery system, introducer, guidewire, and implant development programs in our core Cardio & Vascular markets. 
Cardiac & Neuromodulation | Active projects to develop next generation technology programs for our batteries, filtered feedthroughs, high voltage capacitors and finished device solutions including both leads and IPG systems that reduce the size and cost, while improving performance, for cardiac and neuromodulation devices. 

Non-Medical. Some of the more significant product development opportunities in our Non-Medical segment are next generation medium-rate and high-rate batteries that offer extended performance such as higher power pulsing capabilities and increased operating temperature range, real time battery monitoring, and high temperature super capacitors.
Patents and Proprietary Technology
Our policy is to protect our intellectual property rights related to our technologies and products, and we rely on a combination of patents, licenses, trade secrets and know-how to establish and protect our rights. Where appropriate, we apply for U.S. and foreign patents. We also are a party to license agreements with third parties under which we have obtained, on varying terms, exclusive or non-exclusive rights to patents held by them. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business or to our business as a whole. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 691 U.S. and foreign patents, of which 196 are licensed.
Design, development and regulatory aspects of our business also provide competitive advantages, and we require our employees, consultants and other parties having access to our confidential information to execute confidentiality agreements. These agreements prohibit disclosure of confidential information to third parties, except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees and consultants, the agreements generally provide that all confidential information relating to our business is the exclusive property of Integer.
- 8 -


Manufacturing, Regulatory and Quality Assurance
We leverage our strength as an innovative designer and manufacturer of finished devices and components to the medical device industry. Our manufacturing and engineering services include: design, testing, component manufacture, and device manufacture. We also provide regulatory services including product registration and post-market surveillance in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the U.S. and EU as well as other geographies. We have integrated our proprietary technologies in our own products and those of our customers. Our flexible, high productivity manufacturing capabilities span sites across the United States, Mexico, Uruguay, Ireland, Malaysia, and Israel.
Due to the highly regulated nature of the products we produce, we have implemented strong quality systems across all sites. The quality systems at our sites are compliant with and certified to various recognized international standards, requirements, and directives. Each site’s quality system is certified under an applicable International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) quality system standard, such as ISO 13485 (Medical device and component sites) or ISO 9001 (Electrochem). This certification requires, among other things, an implemented quality system that applies (where applicable) to the design and manufacture of components, assemblies and finished medical devices, including component quality and supplier control. Maintenance of these certifications for each facility requires periodic re-examination from an independent notified body.
Along with ISO 13485, the facilities producing finished medical devices are subject to oversight by Notified Bodies and extensive and rigorous regulation by numerous government bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other international regulatory agencies, to assure the conformance of devices and components on a worldwide basis. For these facilities, we maintain FDA registration and compliance with all applicable domestic and international regulations. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA and international regulatory bodies.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
We purchase some critical raw materials from a limited number of suppliers due to the technically challenging requirements of the supplied product and/or the lengthy process required to qualify these materials both internally and with our customers. We cannot quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for these materials because of these rigid requirements. For these critical raw materials, we maintain safety stocks and partner with suppliers through contract to help ensure the continuity of supply. Historically, we have not experienced significant interruptions or delays in obtaining critical raw materials.
Many of the raw materials that are used in our products are subject to fluctuations in market price. In particular, the prices of precious metals, such as platinum, have historically fluctuated, and the prices that we pay for these materials, and, in some cases, their availability, are dependent upon general market conditions. In most cases, we have pass-through pricing arrangements with our customers that purchase components containing precious metals or have established firm-pricing agreements with our suppliers that are designed to minimize our exposure to market fluctuations.
We utilize competitive pricing methods such as bulk purchases, precious metal pool buys, blanket orders, and long-term contracts to secure supply. 
As discussed more fully in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this report, our business depends on a continuous supply of raw materials from a limited number of suppliers. If an unforeseen interruption of supply were to occur, we may be unable to obtain substitute sources for these raw materials on a timely basis, on terms acceptable to us or at all, which could harm our ability to manufacture our products profitably or on time. Additionally, we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for these materials as there are a limited number of worldwide suppliers.
Working Capital Practices
Our goal is to carry sufficient levels of inventory to ensure that we have adequate supply of raw materials from suppliers and meet the product delivery needs of our customers. We also provide and receive payment terms to customers and from suppliers in the normal course of business. It will continue to be a priority for us to maintain appropriate working capital levels while improving our operating cash flow and pay down outstanding debt.
Government Regulation
Medical Device Regulation
Integer develops, manufactures, markets and sells products in multiple countries throughout the world and is therefore subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies, including the FDA, European Commission, Health Product Regulatory Agency, Health Canada, Therapeutics Goods Administration and other comparable foreign counterparts. These regulatory requirements subject our products and our business to numerous risks that are specifically discussed within “Risks Related to Our Industries” under Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this report. A summary of critical aspects of our regulatory environment is included below.  
- 9 -


In the U.S., these regulations are enacted by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments, and the regulations issued or proposed thereunder. 
The FDA’s Quality System Regulation sets forth basic quality requirements for our sites that includes product design and manufacturing processes, requires the maintenance of certain records, and provides for on-site inspection of our facilities and continuing review by the FDA. Authorization to commercially market our non-exempt products in the U.S. is granted by the FDA under procedures referred to as 510(k) pre-market notification or pre-market approval (“PMA”).  These processes require us to notify the FDA of the new product and obtain FDA clearance or approval before marketing the device. 
The FDA classifies medical devices based on the risks associated with use of the device. Devices are classified into one of three categories - Class I, Class II, or Class III. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are therefore subject to the least regulatory controls, referred to as General Controls. Class II devices are higher risk devices than Class I and require greater regulatory controls, generally General Controls, and Special Controls which includes a pre-market notification called a 510(k), which provides reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness as well as substantial equivalence to a previously cleared device, as demonstrated by data. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are therefore subject to the highest level of regulatory control, requiring a PMA by the FDA before they are marketed and continued controls in the form of amendments or supplements required when product or process changes are made.
The member countries of the European Union (“EU”) have adopted the European Medical Device Directives ("MDD”) and Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (“AIMDD”), which create a single set of requirements for all member countries that apply to our products. The MDD and AIMDD are in the process of being replaced by the European Medical Device Regulation (“EU-MDR”) which becomes effective in May 2021 after being delayed one (1) year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These directives require, and the EU-MDR will require, companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in the EU to obtain a CE Mark for those products. The CE Mark indicates the product has met minimum standards of performance, essential requirements, safety conformity assessment and quality. Companies must work with an EU recognized Notified Body to gain approval for the product and manufacturing site before obtaining free movement of products throughout the member countries. In Europe, our devices are considered either Class I, Class IIa, Class III, or AIMD, under MDD or AIMDD and will be with Class I, Class IIa or Class III under the EU-MDR.
In addition to the U.S. and EU, we have approval to manufacture or market our products in numerous foreign countries and therefore are subject to other regulations affecting, among other things, product standards, sterilization, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, and import laws. We are also subject to onsite inspection by independent bodies with the authority to issue or not issue certifications we may require to be able to sell products in certain countries.  Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA or EU; however, others vary widely, ranging from simple product registrations to detailed submissions such as those required by the FDA.
We believe that the procedures we use for quality controls, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our medical devices conform to the requirements of all pertinent regulations.
Environmental Health and Safety Laws
We are subject to direct governmental regulation, including the laws and regulations generally applicable to all businesses in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the emission, discharge, use, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of these materials at our facilities and at off-site disposal locations. Our manufacturing and RD&E activities may involve the controlled use of small amounts of hazardous materials. Liabilities associated with hazardous material releases arise principally under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and analogous state laws that impose strict, joint and several liability on owners and operators of contaminated facilities and parties that arrange for the off-site disposal of hazardous materials. We are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws currently applicable to our business and we are not subject to any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any of our facilities or any off-site location. We may, however, become subject to these environmental liabilities in the future as a result of our historic or current operations.
Conflict Minerals and Supply Chain
We are subject to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act concerning “conflict minerals” (generally tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold) and similar rules are being implemented by the EU. Certain of these conflict minerals are used in the manufacture of our products. These rules require us to investigate the source of any conflict minerals necessary to the production or functionality of our products. If any such conflict minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries (the “DRC region”), we must undertake due diligence efforts to determine whether such minerals financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC region. Since our supply chain is complex, our ongoing compliance with these rules could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of conflict minerals used in the manufacture of our products.
- 10 -


We are also subject to disclosure requirements regarding abusive labor practices in portions of our supply chain under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the UK Modern Slavery Act.
Other Laws and Regulations
Our sales and marketing practices are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to federal anti-kickback laws, and are also subject to similar state laws.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, Integer employed approximately 7,500 associates worldwide, of whom approximately 3,400 are located in the U.S., 2,300 in Mexico, 1,200 in Ireland, 300 in Uruguay, 300 in Malaysia, as well as a small number of associates in Israel and Switzerland. We also employ approximately 17 temporary employees worldwide to assist with various projects and service functions and address peaks in staff requirements. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees. Our Board of Directors and the executive team put significant focus on our human capital resources, as we strive to build leadership capability and create a diverse, inclusive work environment that inspires excellence. This cultural framework recognizes the value of individuals as critical to Integer’s operational strategy. 
Associate Management and Development
The internal leaders at Integer are responsible for managing the talent of our associates. To effectively manage associate development, we utilize a “Talent Cycle” framework, which provides an integrated approach to meet the human capital needs of the company. The Talent Cycle (i) defines the major categories of leadership responsibilities in alignment with the employment lifecycle and (ii) prioritizes programs and resources to ensure these responsibilities are executed consistently. Stages of the Talent Cycle include:
•Planning for current and future capabilities
•Acquiring the critical talent needed to run our business
•Engaging our associates to motivate and retain them
•Differentiating our talent at all levels to foster a performance culture
•Developing our talent to achieve performance excellence 
•Promoting associates who have demonstrated strong leadership capability
Woven throughout this cyclical approach to managing talent is an emphasis on diversity and inclusion. Developing our talent is one of the most critical stages in the Talent Cycle and an ongoing focus at Integer. To support the advancement of our associates, we have defined a model of core skills and competencies to guide associates in their development planning, and we encourage associates to actively focus on their own development though individual development plans, designed to help each associate be more effective in their current role and to prepare for their next role. Additionally, we regularly conduct talent reviews and succession planning to identify and develop our top leadership talent.
Competitive Pay/Benefits
Our total rewards program is designed to attract, retain and motivate associates to contribute to Integer’s success, and includes market-competitive elements reflective of the geographies in which we operate. We incorporate many factors into associate pay decisions, including market comparisons of compensation and benefits for similar roles, individual associate skills and experience in their role, individual performance over multiple years, and relative contributions to the Company’s short- and long-term success. We have analyzed the compensation of our senior leadership team and concluded there is no pay gap between genders.
Focus on Inclusion
At Integer, through our values, Code of Conduct, and commitment to diversity and inclusion, we strive to create a culture that unifies and embraces the uniqueness each associate brings to Integer, positioning the company for long-term success. To advance our efforts to build a more unified and diverse culture, we have a Senior Director of Diversity and Inclusion, who is tasked with leading us in the development of the strategies and actions necessary to create an inclusive environment. We are committed to creating a better, more inclusive company in which all of us accept, respect and value one another’s individual differences, encouraging different perspectives and ideas that improve team synergy and communication. 
In 2020, we also formalized our diversity and inclusion strategy, creating a robust engagement platform designed to increase innovation and enhance business. We have infused diversity and inclusion into our business processes and created local and global engagement opportunities for associates.

Key successes in 2020 from our diversity and inclusion strategy include: 
•100% executive leadership actively serve as executive sponsors of D&I initiatives
•Formation of two cross functional governing diversity and inclusion councils, which advance the global D&I strategy at all levels of the organization
•Launched employee resource groups, which are voluntary, employee-led groups comprised of associates who join together based on common interests, backgrounds or demographic factors 
•Establishment of diversity and inclusion site champions, whose responsibility it is to promote the company’s diversity and inclusion initiative at each Integer location 
Impact of COVID-19
Throughout the COVID-19 global pandemic, the health and safety of our associates has remained a priority for us. We implemented a comprehensive pandemic plan to safeguard our associates from COVID-19 infection and exposure, including policies, procedures, protocols, and guidance related to, among other things, COVID-19 symptom awareness, effective hygiene practices, travel restrictions, visitor restrictions, social distancing, face covering expectations, temperature and health screening, work-from-home requirements, absenteeism policies, enhanced workplace cleaning, and large-scale decontamination.
To balance cost management during what we expect to be temporary sales declines in certain areas, we utilized reductions-in-force, furloughs and temporary shutdowns to more closely align labor with customer demand, and we will continue to assess the need for further actions in this area. In doing so, we have consistently monitored benefits available to our associates under various governmental programs, including assistance for associates unable to work for COVID-19 reasons. We have sought, and will continue to seek to understand whether these benefits apply to our associates, how the available benefits support the best interests of our associates, and how the available benefits may impact our business now and in the future as we return to more normalized operations.
Seasonality
Our business is generally not seasonal in nature. However, since our customers are large OEM businesses, our sales are influenced by the inventory levels they carry, which can cause shifts in our sales volume as their inventories fluctuate.
