General Development of Business
Overview
WLT is a self-managed, publicly owned, non-traded real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, invests in, manages and seeks to enhance the value of, interests in lodging and lodging-related properties in the United States. As a REIT, we are not subject to U.S. federal income taxation as long as we satisfy certain requirements, principally relating to the nature of our income, the level of our distributions to our stockholders and other factors. As of December 31, 2021, substantially all of our assets and liabilities are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, CWI 2 OP, LP (the “Operating Partnership”) and we are a general partner and a limited partner of, and own a 99.0% capital interest in, the Operating Partnership. Watermark Capital Partners, LLC (“Watermark Capital”), which is 100% owned by Mr. Michael G. Medzigian, our Chief Executive Officer, holds the remaining 1.0% in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2021. In order to qualify as a REIT, we cannot operate hotels directly; therefore, we lease our hotels to our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs” and collectively the “TRS lessees”). As of December 31, 2021, we held ownership interests in 25 hotels, with a total of 8,163 rooms.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows throughout 2021 and will continue to do so for the reasonably foreseeable future. As of March 28, 2022, all of our hotels are open but several continue to operate at reduced levels of occupancy and staffing. Although results improved relative to 2020, we cannot estimate with certainty when travel demand will fully recover or how new variants of COVID-19 could impact recovery. We have generally experienced improving demand at our properties as government-imposed restrictions and limitations on travel and large gatherings have loosened and as vaccines have become more widely available. We expect the recovery to continue to occur unevenly across our portfolio, with hotels that cater to business travel recovering more slowly than resort properties. Governmental and business efforts to encourage or mandate vaccinations and public adoption rates of vaccines have impacted and may continue to impact the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and have had and may continue to have disruptive effects on certain segments of the labor market. Individual ability or desire to travel and corporate travel policies will continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and affect the recovery of our properties. The ultimate severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects, and the emergence of variants, are uncertain, including whether COVID-19 will become endemic or cyclical in nature. Given these uncertainties, we cannot estimate with reasonable certainty the impact on our business, financial condition or near- or long-term financial or operational results. 
Estimated Net Asset Value
Our estimated net asset value (“NAV”) as of December 31, 2021 has been determined to be $6.29 per share of Class A stock and $6.22 per share of Class T stock, based on shares outstanding as of December 31,2021. Please see our Current Report on Form 8-K for additional information regarding the calculation of our NAVs.

Narrative Description of Business
General
We are a publicly owned, non-traded REIT that strives to create value in the lodging industry with a focus on building and enhancing the value of a portfolio of interests in lodging and lodging related investments. We employ value-added strategies, such as re-branding, renovating, expanding or changing hotel operators, when we believe such strategies will increase the operating results and values of the hotels we acquire. We regularly review the hotels in our portfolio to ensure that they continue to meet our investment criteria. If we were to conclude that a hotel’s value has been maximized, or that it no longer fits within our financial or strategic criteria, we may seek to sell the hotel and use the net proceeds for investments in our existing or new hotels, or to reduce our overall leverage. While we do not operate our hotel properties, both our asset management team and our executive management team monitor and work cooperatively with our hotel operators in all aspects of our hotels' operations, including advising and making recommendations regarding property positioning and repositioning, revenue and expense management, operations analysis, physical design, renovation and capital improvements, guest experience and overall strategic direction. We believe that we can add significant value to our portfolio through our intensive asset management strategies. Our executive and asset management teams have significant experience in hotels, as well as in creating and implementing innovative asset management initiatives.
Our business was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the material reduction in demand experienced by our hotels and the lodging industry generally. See “Risk Factors - Risk Related to our Business and Operations - The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to materially and adversely affect us and they are expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.”
As a REIT, we are allowed to own lodging properties, but are prohibited from operating these properties. In order to comply with applicable REIT qualification rules, we enter into leases with certain of our subsidiaries organized as TRSs. The TRS lessees in turn contract with independent property operators that manage the day-to-day operations of our properties.
The lodging properties we have acquired include full-service branded hotels located in urban settings, resort properties and select-service hotels. Full-service hotels generally provide a full complement of guest amenities, including food and beverage services, meeting and conference facilities, concierge and room service and valet parking, among others. Select-service hotels typically have limited food and beverage outlets and do not offer comprehensive business or banquet facilities. Resort properties may include smaller boutique hotels and large-scale integrated resorts. All of our investments to date have been in the United States, however, we may consider, and are not prohibited under our organizational documents from making, investments outside the United States.
Our Portfolio
As of December 31, 2021, our portfolio was comprised of our full or partial ownership in 25 hotels with 8,163 guest rooms, all located in the United States. See Item 2. Properties.
Holding Period
We generally intend to hold our investments in real property for an extended period depending on the type of investment. The determination of whether a particular asset should be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made after consideration of relevant factors, including prevailing economic conditions, with a view to achieving maximum capital appreciation for our stockholders while avoiding increases in risk. No assurance can be given that this objective will be realized.
Financing Strategies
As of December 31, 2021, our hotel portfolio, including both the hotels that we consolidate in our financial statements (“Consolidated Hotels”) (as further discussed in Note 4) and the hotel that we record as an equity investment in our financial statements (“Unconsolidated Hotel”) (as further discussed in Note 5), was 64% leveraged. Our organizational documents permit us to incur leverage of up to 75% of the total costs of our investments or 300% of our net assets (whichever is less), or a higher amount with the approval of a majority of our independent directors.

Competition
The hotel industry is highly competitive. Hotels we acquire compete with other hotels for guests in our markets. Competitive factors include location, convenience, brand affiliation, room rates, range and the quality of services, facilities and guest amenities or accommodations offered. Competition in the markets in which our hotels operate include competition from existing, newly renovated and newly developed hotels in the relevant segments. Competition can adversely affect the occupancy, average daily rates (“ADR”), and revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) of our hotels, and thus our financial results, and may require us to provide additional amenities, incur additional costs or make capital improvements that we otherwise might not choose to make, which may adversely affect our profitability.
Seasonality
Certain lodging properties are seasonal in nature. Generally, occupancy rates and revenues are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. As a result of the seasonality of certain lodging properties, there may be quarterly fluctuations in results of operations of our properties. Quarterly financial results may be adversely affected by factors outside our control, including weather conditions and poor economic factors. 
Certain Environmental and Regulatory Matters
Our hotel properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. In connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels, we may potentially be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities (including investigation, clean-up and disposal of hazardous materials released at, on, under, in or from the property). Environmental laws and regulations typically impose responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous materials or contamination, and liability is often joint and several. As part of our efforts to mitigate these risks, we typically engage third parties to perform assessments of potential environmental risks when evaluating new acquisitions or if required to do so by a lender. Such environmental surveys are limited in scope, however, and we remain exposed to contaminates (e.g., such as asbestos and mold) and hazardous or regulated substances used during the routine operations of our hotels (e.g., swimming pool or dry cleaning chemicals). Our hotel properties incur costs to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and could be subject to fines and penalties for non-compliance. 
We have not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our properties. And although we are not currently aware of any material environmental or health and safety claims pending or threatened against us, a claim may be asserted against us in the future that could have a material adverse effect on us. 
Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”) to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. We believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with the ADA, however, the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate.
In addition, our hotel properties are subject to state and local health and safety laws, regulations and mandates relating to their operations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Human Capital Resources
We had no employees prior to the Internalization in April 2020. As part of the Internalization, we hired substantially all of the former employees of Watermark Capital and a number of the former employees of WPC that had performed services for us. We made awards of restricted stock to key employees as means of incentivizing and retaining them. As of December 31, 2021, we had 32 employees.
We experienced highly competitive conditions in the labor market in 2021, and we expect these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future. In 2021, we adopted a retention plan under which we granted restricted stock and/or cash awards to employees to incentivize them to remain with us. 
The third party operators that manage our hotels are generally responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at the hotels. The operators implemented significant furloughs of hotel personnel in 2020 due to governmental shutdowns and lack of demand attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.
