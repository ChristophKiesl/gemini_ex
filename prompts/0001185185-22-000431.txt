ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Our Corporate History and Background



We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 5, 2013. Our original business plan was to sell freshly squeezed juices from mobile stands in London, United Kingdom, but this business was not successful, and we did not generate any revenue from this business.



On April 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of PGL and as a result, PGL became our wholly-owned subsidiary and the former shareholders of PGL became the holders of approximately 98.4% of our issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully-diluted basis. We changed our name to Porter Holding International, Inc. on May 8, 2017 to more accurately reflect our new business. For accounting purposes, the transaction with PGL was treated as a reverse acquisition, with PGL as the acquirer and the Company as the acquired party.



As described below in more detail, through our PRC VIEs that have contractual arrangements with PGL’s subsidiary, Qianhai Porter, we are at the early stage of developing our O2O (Online to Offline) business and our goal is to become a leading innovative O2O business platform operator providing both online E-commerce and offline physical business facilities to our customers.



Our Corporate Structure



PRC laws and regulations prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of companies that operate Internet information and content, Internet access, online games, mobile, value added telecommunications and certain other businesses in which we are engaged or could be deemed to be engaged. Given such restrictions on direct ownership of some aspects of our business by foreign investors, we conduct our operations in the PRC through our VIEs. Our PRC subsidiary Qianhai Porter has nominal operations or assets. As a result of the contractual arrangements by and among Qianhai Porter, Portercity and Portercity’s shareholders, under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, we are considered the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and thus consolidate the VIEs’ results in our consolidated financial statements.



PGL, a Seychelles holding company, was formed on October 13, 2016. The share capital of the company is $50,000 divided into 500,000,000 ordinary shares of $0.0001 par value each. On December 6, 2016, the authorized and issued capital of PGL increased to $725,000 divided into 7,250,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.0001 each.



On November 29, 2016, Mr. Zongjian Chen, the sole shareholder of PPBGL, transferred 100% of the outstanding shares of PPBGL to PGL. As PGL was also owned and controlled by Mr. Zongjian Chen then, the share transfer was accounted for as a common control transaction. Other than its 100% ownership of PPBGL, PGL has no significant assets and no other business operations.



PPBGL was incorporated in Hong Kong on September 21, 2016 as a company with limited liability as an investment holding company. Upon incorporation, PPBGL issued 1 ordinary share at HK$1. Also, on September 21, 2016, an additional 9,999 ordinary shares were issued, and Mr. Zongjian Chen held all the 10,000 ordinary shares of PPBGL on behalf of the original investors of Portercity. PPBGL has no significant assets or business operations.



Qianhai Porter was incorporated in the PRC as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise with limited liability on November 21, 2016. Qianhai Porter was set up by PPBGL. Qianhai Porter was incorporated to control the shareholders’ voting interests in Portercity and become the primary beneficiary of Portercity and its subsidiaries, or the VIEs.



Portercity’s equity interests were held by Mr. Zonghua Chen (brother of Mr. Zongjian Chen) and Ms. Xiaomei Xiong (spouse of Mr. Zongjian Chen) on behalf of other investors, including Mr. Zonghua Chen himself.



On December 1, 2016, Portercity acquired a 100% equity interest in Porter Consulting, from Shenzhen Porter Holdings Co., Ltd., for a cash consideration of $144,154 (RMB1,000,000).

In August 2019, Porter E-Commerce acquired 60% of the equity interest in Maihuolang E-Commerce, which is engaged in the business of online e-commerce. In October 2019, shareholders of Maihuolang E-Commerce reached an agreement to increase the registered capital of Maihuolang E-Commerce from RMB 5,000,000 (approximately $718,205) to RMB 5,263,157 (approximately $756,005), and such additional registered capital was contributed by Maihuolang (Beijing) Technology Development Co., Ltd., an entity controlled by a minority shareholder of Maihuolang E-Commerce, Mr. Kezhan Ma. Consequently, Porter E-Commerce’s equity interest in Maihuolang E-Commerce was reduced to 57%. Because Maihuolang E-Commerce failed to realize anticipated benefits and value creation, on July 15, 2020, Porter E-Commerce entered into an equity transfer agreement with Mr. Kezhan Ma, whereby Porter E-Commerce transferred its 57% equity interests in Maihuolang E-Commerce to Mr. Kezhan Ma, for cash consideration of RMB 650,000 (approximately $95,735) which amount is payable in one-time payment within eight months of the filing of the equity transfer with the local Business Registration agency. The payment was made by Mr. Kezhan Ma on July 27, 2020.



In July 2021, Porter E-commerce and Mr. Shoubao Guo established Shenzhen Xinsanmao Wine Co., Ltd in Shenzhen, China, with a registered capital of RMB1,000,000 (approximately $155,198). Porter E-commerce and Mr. Shoubao Guo hold 51% and 49% of equity interests in Xinsanmao Wine, respectively. Xinsanmao Wine is engaged in the business of wine distribution.



Contractual Agreements Establishing the VIE Structure



On December 15, 2016, our indirectly wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary, Qianhai Porter, Portercity and the shareholders of Portercity entered into the following commercial arrangements, or collectively, VIE Agreements, pursuant to which we have contractual rights to control and operate the businesses of Portercity and Portercity’s subsidiaries:

● | Pursuant to a commission management and consulting services agreement, or the Service Agreement, Qianhai Porter agreed to act as the exclusive management and advisory consultant of Portercity and provide client management, marketing promotion counseling, corporate management and counseling, finance counseling and personnel training services to Portercity. In exchange, Portercity agreed to pay Qianhai Porter a management and consulting fee to be equivalent to the amount of net profit before tax of Portercity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursuant to an exclusive right and option to purchase agreement, or the Option Agreement, the shareholders of Portercity granted to Qianhai Porter the exclusive right and option to purchase, at any time during the term of the Option Agreement, all of the assets of and equity interests shares in Portercity, at the exercise price equal to the lowest possible price permitted by Chinese laws;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursuant to a shareholders’ voting rights proxy agreement, or the Voting Rights Agreement, each of the shareholders of Portercity irrevocably appointed the representatives designated by Qianhai Porter to exercise its exclusive voting right of shareholders in the general meeting of shareholders of Portercity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursuant to an equity interest pledge agreement, the Pledge Agreement, the shareholders of Portercity pledged all of the equity interests in Portercity and any and all legitimate income generated from such equity interests to Qianhai Porter to ensure the rights, privileges and concessions of Qianhai Porter under this and the above contractual arrangements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The foregoing description of the VIE Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the VIE Agreements, a copy of each of the VIE Agreements is incorporated by reference as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.4 hereto.



As a result of the above contractual arrangements, we maintain substantial control over the VIEs’ daily operations and financial affairs, election of their senior executives and all matters requiring shareholder approval. Furthermore, as the primary beneficiary of the VIEs, we are entitled to consolidate the financial results of the VIEs in our own consolidated financial statements under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 810 and related subtopics related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, or ASC Topic 810.

However, our stockholders will not and may never directly hold equity interests in the VIEs which are the operating companies in China. Uncertainties exist as to our ability to enforce the VIE Agreements, and the VIE Agreements have not been tested in a court of law. The Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow this VIE structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations and the value of our common stock, including that it could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. In addition, we rely on the contractual arrangements with the VIE Portercity and its shareholders to operate, which may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control and may have potential conflicts of interests with us. Due to great uncertainties under Chinese law and jurisdictional limits, we, as a Nevada holding company, may face substantial challenges in enforcing these contractual agreements. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the VIE Structure” for a detailed discussion of the risks, uncertainties and challenges related to the contractual arrangements.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the opinion of Guang Dong LianRui Law Firm, our PRC legal counsel:




● | the ownership structures of our wholly-foreign owned enterprise and VIEs in China do not violate any applicable PRC law, regulation, or rule currently in effect; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the contractual arrangements between our wholly-foreign owned enterprise, the material variable interest entity and the variable interest entity’s equity holders governed by PRC laws are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws, rules, and regulations currently in effect, and does not violate any applicable PRC law, regulation, or rule currently in effect.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We have been further advised by our PRC legal counsel, Guang Dong LianRui Law Firm, that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities may, in the future, take a view that is contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel; that if the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our Internet-based business do not comply with PRC government restrictions on foreign investment in the aforesaid business we engage in, we could be subject to severe penalties including being prohibited from continuing operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the VIE Structure.”

Our Platforms and Service Offerings



With the development of mobile Internet, e-commerce, social networks, physical stores and the coming of big data economy era, the online and offline worlds are becoming increasingly more integrated. The Online to Offline (O2O) business model that contains the original business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C) and consumer-to-consumer (C2C) is in the rapid development., O2O is no longer a one-way consumption model, which neither merely guides traditional purchasers to consume online nor only leads online consumers to enjoy offline experience or service. The O2O commerce solutions industry in China has witnessed fast growth in the past decade.



We are a commercial platform provider that offers “O2O (Network + Entity) * Services” and only focus on commodities and merchants. We provide commodities with concrete platforms for promotions in terms of online marketing coverage and offline marketing services. The online marketing coverage for merchants refers to services such as global promotion of corporate brand & image of merchants, layout of distributor and agency channels, sharing of supply and demand information, creation of commercial credit, recruitment of talents. The offline marketing services are offered to merchants with value-added services such as brand marketing, financial services, credit guarantees, capital market access and public listing, training, education, summits, government relations, and third-party professional services referrals.



Specifically, we are currently developing and plan to provide following core products and services to our customers:



1. Our PT37.com platform (also known as “platform business opportunity” with ICP qualification, established and went into operation at 2009), is a commercial cloud platform, in which all kinds of global small and medium-sized enterprises can apply for access and obtain services free of charge. It is a professional information-supply-and-demand platform with high degree of flexibility, in which enterprises could achieve enterprise informatization within a short time. Through the platform, the enterprises can internally realize IMIS information management and externally release information, display product and services. At present, the categories of products on the pt37.com platform include books, videos, instruments, household appliances, electronic products, home furniture, clothing, automobiles, toys, food and beauty. Each category could be further divided into sub-categories with various search criteria and parameters, allowing merchants to accurately search for information and increase the relevance of searched results. Currently, there are millions of member companies registered on the platform. We do not charge them but we will select high-quality merchant customers based on the transaction volume to enter our O2O platform for operation. In other words, this is a customer resources screening pool as well as the starting point of our “O2O (Network + Entity) * Services” business model.



2. Our 17yugo.com platform (also known as: Porter E-Mall, with ICP qualifications, established and went into operation at 2018) is the online section of our “O2O (Network + Entity) * Services” business model. Currently hundreds of merchants have been selected from member enterprises and thousands of goods of origin have been stationed. In the future, these merchants and products will be stationed in offline Port City simultaneously, and the layout of Porter E-Mall will be synchronized with the physical Port City.



3. Our Port City platform is offline section of our “O2O (Network + Entity) * Services” business model. Regional center cities are top choices of Port City, which may cover more than 1 million square meters. Each Port City will have functions including exhibition, brokerage, procurement, wholesale, order, hotel, conference, warehousing, logistics, distribution and payment. At the same time, within the 200-kilometer range around the Potter City, the traditional 50-square-meter physical stores will be upgraded to form “satellite” physical stores in Porter City with in-depth sales and other services.



Port City platform is built by third parties or through cooperation with third-party property owners. We conduct management and profit earning through operating the platform. The first physical Port City is currently under construction, and the upgrades of nearly thousands of “satellite” stores have been completed.



4. Our payment platform is dedicated to the development of internet software and hardware services for enterprises and individuals. At present, the external services include Internet payment, mobile payment, POS machine receipt, electronic technology development, and Internet marketing services, while the internal services are to provide payment services for our own O2O platform.

Since 2017, we have carried out a large number of value-added services for all of our merchant members and customers based on the simultaneous operation of the “O2O (Network + Entity) * Services” business model, and thus earned revenues. In 2017, by collecting conference fees, we organized member companies to conduct new economic summits and forums to preach and disseminate our “O2O (Network + Entity) * Services” business model. In 2018, we began to screen member merchant enterprises to enter our O2O platform, and provided them with “O2O (Network + Entity) * Services” commercial operation services. For those qualified enterprises, we offer public listing consulting services, which help us achieve good returns. At the beginning of 2019, we began to expand the global trade and commodity import and export business of the stationed enterprises. Due to the global covid-19 pandemic starting in 2020, business and trade of the world was unable to develop as usual. We are now engaging in developing our business in areas including e-commerce, cross-boarder trade and influencer live stream sales etc. to enhance our performance. In 2021, we will strive to achieve breakthrough in our consultancy services on influencer sales, e-commerce, bulk trade, supply chain, as well as other possible new promotional tools to achieve the desired results.



Investment and Corporate Management Consulting Services



According to the development demand and future goals of our customers, in 2018 we started to offer a series of services such as business planning, financial guidance, business matching and guidance for listing primarily in the United States. At present, in our customer pool, many small and medium-sized enterprises have increased their public awareness. They are seeking the potential advantages of being a listed company and striving for obtaining the recognition of international capital to accelerate their corporate expansion. But many enterprises themselves may not be familiar with the listing requirements, laws and regulations of different capital markets, and the process of obtaining financing from overseas markets.



In order to help our customers who intend to access to the overseas capital market, we have a team of experienced professionals who have professional knowledge of the listing rules and regulations of various capital markets. We aim to make full use of our expertise and resources in the capital markets to assist these customers to achieve their goals.



Starting from the second quarter of 2018, through Portercity and Porter Commercial, we have been providing investment and corporate management consulting services to our clients, especially those who have the intention to be publicly listed in the stock exchanges in the United States and other countries. We categorize our consulting services into three phases:




● | Phase I consulting services primarily include due diligence review, market research and feasibility study, business plan drafting, accounting record review, and business analysis and recommendations etc. Management estimates that Phase I normally takes around three months to complete based on its past experiences.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase II consulting services primarily include reorganization, pre-listing education and tutoring, talent search, legal and audit firm recommendation and coordination, VIE contracts and other public-listing related documents review, merger and acquisition planning, investor referral and pre-listing equity financing source identification and recommendation, independent directors and audit committee candidates recommendation; shell company identification and recommendation for customers expecting to become publicly listed through reverse merger transaction; etc. Management estimates that Phase II normally takes about five months to complete based its past experiences.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase III consulting services primarily include assistance in preparation of customers’ registration statement under IPO transactions or Form 8-K under reverse merger transactions; assistance in answering comments and questions received from regulatory agencies etc. Management believes it is very difficult to estimate the timing of this phase of service as the completion of Phase III services is not within the Company’s control.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Each phase of consulting services is standalone and fees associated with each phase are usually clearly identified in service agreements. Revenue from providing Phase I and Phase II consulting services to customers is recognized based on the output methods, including surveys of performance completed to date or milestones reached of each phase only when the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Otherwise, such revenue is recognized at a point in time when services are delivered and accepted by customers. Revenue from providing Phase III consulting services to customers is recognized upon completion of reverse merger transaction or IPO transaction, which is evidenced by filing of 8-K for reverse merger transaction or receipt of effective notice from regulatory agencies for IPO transaction. Revenue that has been billed, collected but not yet recognized is reflected as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets.

Depending on the complexity of the underlying service arrangement and related terms and conditions, significant judgments, assumptions and estimates may be required to determine when substantial delivery of contract elements has occurred, whether any significant ongoing obligations exist subsequent to contract execution, whether amounts due are collectible and the appropriate period or periods in which, or during which, the completion of the earnings process occurs. Depending on the magnitude of specific revenue arrangements, adjustment may be made to the judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding contracts executed in any specific period.



On June 28, 2018, Portercity and Mr. Zhibo Mao established Weifang Portercity in Weifang, Shandong Province, the PRC, with a registered capital of RMB1,000,000 (approximately $146,000). Portercity and Mr. Zhibo Mao hold 60% and 40% equity interest in Weifang Portercity, respectively. Weifang Portercity is intended to be engaged in the business of providing various consulting services to its clients, especially to those who have the intention to be publicly listed in the stock exchanges in the United States and other countries. As of December 31, 2020, Weifang Portercity has not commenced operations. In January 2021, Weifang Portercity agreed with the local government to terminate this project, as a result of the local government changing its development strategy. Weifang Portercity received a compensation of approximately $538,665from the local government to compensate its upfront establishment expenses including expenditure relating to office renovation, office equipment and supplies. Weifang Portercity was dissolved on April 22, 2021.



Training services



Starting from the first quarter of 2019, the Company, via PPBGL and Porter Commercial, provides various training services to its clients, primarily related to e-commerce platform operation, expansion of channels and other promotion strategies, and capital market operation, via live and online sessions. In order to recognize revenue, the Company is required to identify an approved contract with commitments to perform respective obligations, identify rights of each party in the transaction regarding goods to be transferred, identify the payment terms for the goods transferred, verify that the contract has commercial substance and verify that collection of substantially all consideration is probable. The fees associated with the course of training sessions are clearly identified in service agreements. Training service revenue is recognized at the time when the training sessions stipulated in the contract are completed.



Our Customers



Currently, through our VIE entity, Porter Consulting, we partner with China Payment, a third-party online payment service provider, to promote China Payment’s online payment platform to companies and businesses in Shenzhen and in return share a portion of the processing fees earned by China Payment as commission.



In addition, Porter Consulting partners with Shenzhen Zhongfu, a third-party online payment service provider, under which Porter Consulting agreed to promote Shenzhen Zhongfu’s online payment platform, including the Point of Sale (POS) system, to companies and businesses in China and in return obtain a certain amount of commission based on the volume of trading through such online payment platform.



Starting from the second quarter of 2018, through Portercity and Porter Commercial, we have been providing investment and corporate management consulting services to our clients, especially those who have the intention to be publicly listed in the stock exchanges in the United States and other countries. They are usually small and medium-sized enterprises based in China.

Our Competition



Our O2O competitors in China include (i) major e-commerce companies, such as Alibaba Group, which operates taobao.com and tmall.com, and JD.com, Inc.; (2) major traditional brick and mortar shopping centers that aim to offer a one-stop shopping experience, such as Walmart China supercenters and Mixc malls. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry include network coverage, brand recognition and reputation, product quality, selection and pricing and quality of customer service. While many of our current or potential competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources, longer operating histories and more established brand names and relationships than we do, we are confident that our business model will offer our customers one-stop services at a relatively low price and accordingly enhance our competitive position.
Regulation 



Because all of our operating entities are located in the PRC, we are regulated by the national and local laws of the PRC. This section summarizes the major PRC regulations relating to our business.
The Telecommunications Regulations



The Telecommunications Regulations, promulgated by the PRC State Council on September 25, 2000 and amended on February 6, 2016, or the Telecom Regulations, set out the general framework under which domestic Chinese companies such as the Company’s PRC subsidiaries and VIEs may engage in various types of telecommunications services in the PRC. The Telecom Regulations defines value-added telecommunications services as telecommunications and information services provided through public networks. Pursuant to the Telecom Regulations, commercial operators of value-added telecommunications services must first obtain an operating license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or its provincial level counterparts.



The Catalog of Telecommunications Business, or the Catalog, which was issued as an attachment to the Telecom Regulations and last updated on June 6, 2019, further categorizes value-added telecommunication services into two classes: Class 1 value-added telecommunication services and Class 2 value-added telecommunication services. Online data processing and transaction processing business and Information services provided via internet fall within Class 2 value-added telecommunications services.



On July 3, 2017, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology amended the Measures on the Administration of Telecommunications Business Operating Permits, or the Telecom License Measures, which became effective on September 1, 2017, to supplement the Telecom Regulations. The Telecom License Measures sets forth the types of licenses required to operate value-added telecommunications services and the qualifications and procedures for obtaining such licenses. The Telecom License Measures also provides that an operator providing value-added services in multiple provinces is required to obtain an inter-regional license, whereas an operator providing value-added services in one province is required to obtain an intra-provincial license. Any telecommunication services operator must conduct its business in accordance with the specifications in its license.

In addition, the Chinese government restricts foreign investment in Internet-related businesses. Accordingly, we operate our Internet-related businesses in China through Portercity, our VIE operating in Shenzhen China.



Regulations Relating to Foreign Investment



The Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment, or the Catalogue, was promulgated and has been amended from time to time by the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission. In Catalogue, Industries for foreign investment are divided into three categories: encouraged, restricted and prohibited. Establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises is generally allowed in encouraged industries. Some restricted industries are limited to equity or contractual joint ventures, while in some cases Chinese partners are required to hold the majority interests in such joint ventures. In addition, restricted category projects are subject to higher-level government approvals. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category. Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations.



In June 2019, the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission promulgated the Special Management Measures (Negative List) for the Access of Foreign Investment, or the Negative List, effective July 30, 2019. Foreign investment in value-added telecommunication business (excluding e-commerce business, domestic multi-party communications services, store and forward services and call center services) falls within the Negative List.



On March 15, 2019, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed the Foreign Investment Law of PRC, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The Law of the People’s Republic of China on China-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures, the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises, and the Law of the People’s Republic of China on China-Foreign Contractual Joint Ventures were replaced at the same time. On December 26, 2019, the Regulation on the Implementation of the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, was issued by the State Council and came into force on January 1, 2020. The Foreign Investment Law of PRC adopts the mechanism of the negative list to regulate foreign investment. A foreign investor may not invest in a field which is prohibited by the foreign investment access negative list from investment. To invest in a field restricted by the foreign investment access negative list from investment, a foreign investor shall meet the investment conditions set out in the negative list. The latest Special Administrative Measures (Negative List) for Foreign Investment Access (2021), or the Negative List, which was promulgated by the Ministry of Commerce of China and the National Development and Reform Commission of China on December 27, 2021, and took effect on January 1, 2022.



In light of the above restrictions and requirements, we conduct our business through our consolidated VIEs.



Under PRC law, the establishment of a wholly foreign owned enterprise is subject to the approval of the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts and the wholly foreign owned enterprise must register with the competent industry and commerce bureau.



Foreign Investment in Value-Added Telecommunications Businesses



The Regulations for Administration of Foreign-invested Telecommunications Enterprises promulgated by the PRC State Council in December 2001 and subsequently amended in February 2016 set forth detailed requirements with respect to capitalization, investor qualifications and application procedures in connection with the establishment of a foreign-invested telecommunications enterprise. These regulations prohibit a foreign entity from owning more than 50% of the total equity interest in any value-added telecommunications service business in China and require the major foreign investor in any value-added telecommunications service business in China have a good and profitable record and operating experience in this industry.
The Measures for the Administration of Internet Information Services



The governing law for Internet information service is the Measures for the Administration of Internet Information Services, or the Internet Content Provider (“ICP”) Measures, which went into effect on September 25, 2000. Under the ICP Measures, any entity that provides information to online Internet users must obtain an operating license from Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (“MIIT”) or its local branch at the provincial level in accordance with the Telecom Regulations described above.

The ICP Measures further stipulate that entities providing online information services in areas of news, publishing, education, medicine, health, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment must obtain permission from responsible national authorities prior to applying for an operating license from MIIT or its local branch at the provincial or municipal level. Moreover, ICPs must display their operating license numbers in a conspicuous location on their websites. ICPs must police their websites to remove categories of harmful content that are broadly defined. Currently, our VIE, Portercity holds an ICP license which was renewed on December 10, 2019, expiring on December 10, 2024.



Internet Information Security and Online Privacy



Regulatory authorities in China have implemented and are considering further legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. China’s new Data Security Law went into effect on September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law provides that the data processing activities must be conducted based on “data classification and hierarchical protection system” for the purpose of data protection and prohibits entities in China from transferring data stored in China to foreign law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities without prior approval by the Chinese government. The Data Security Law sets forth the legal liabilities of entities and individuals found to be in violation of their data protection obligations, including rectification order, warning, fines of up to RMB5 million, suspension of relevant business, and revocation of business permits or licenses.



In addition, the PRC Cybersecurity Law provides that personal information and important data collected and generated by operators of critical information infrastructure in the course of their operations in the PRC should be stored in the PRC, and the law imposes heightened regulation and additional security obligations on operators of critical information infrastructure. According to the initial Cybersecurity Review Measures promulgated by the Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”) and certain other PRC regulatory authorities in April 2020 and becoming effective in June 2020, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security. Any failure or delay in the completion of the cybersecurity review procedures may prevent the critical information infrastructure operator from using or providing certain network products and services, and may result in fines of up to ten times the purchase price of such network products and services. The PRC government recently launched cybersecurity reviews against a number of mobile apps operated by several US-listed Chinese companies and prohibited these apps from registering new users during the review periods.



On July 10, 2021, the CAC issued the Cybersecurity Review Measures (revised draft for public comments), which took effect on February 15, 2022. The revised Cybersecurity Review Measures authorize the CAC to conduct cybersecurity review on a range of activities that affect or may affect national security. The PRC National Security Law defines various types of national security, including technology security and information security. The revised Cybersecurity Review Measures expands the cybersecurity review to data processing operators in possession of personal information of over 1 million users if the operators intend to list their securities in a foreign country. Under the revised Cybersecurity Review Measures, the scope of entities required to undergo cybersecurity review to assess national security risks that arise from data processing activities would be expanded to include all critical information infrastructure operators who purchase network products and services and all data processors carrying out data processing activities that affect or may affect national security. In addition, the revised Cybersecurity Review Measures provide that all such entities that maintain or store the personal information of more than 1 million users and undertake a public listing of securities in a foreign country would be required to pass cybersecurity review, which would focus on the potential risk of core data, important data, or a large amount of personal information being stolen, leaked, destroyed, illegally used or exported out of China, or critical information infrastructure being affected, controlled or maliciously used by foreign governments after such a listing. An operator that violates these Measures shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the PRC Cybersecurity Law and the PRC Data Security Law.



On November 14, 2021, the CAC released the Regulations on Network Data Security (draft for public comments) and accepted public comments until December 13, 2021. The draft Regulations on Network Data Security provide more detailed guidance on how to implement the general legal requirements under legislations such as the Cybersecurity Law, Data Security Law and the Personal Information Protection Law. The draft Regulations on Network Data Security follow the principle that the state will regulate based on a data classification and multi-level protection scheme, under which data is largely classified into three categories: general data, important data and core data. Personal data and important data will be subject to “key” protection and core data to “strict” protection.

On August 20, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law which became effective on November 1, 2021. The Personal Information Protection Law provides a comprehensive set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal information and expands data protection compliance obligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations and individuals in China, and the processing of personal information of persons in China outside of China if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to, or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, persons in China. The Personal Information Protection Law also provides that critical information infrastructure operators and personal information processing entities who process personal information meeting a volume threshold to be set by Chinese cyberspace regulators are also required to store in China personal information generated or collected in China, and to pass a security assessment administered by Chinese cyberspace regulators for any export of such personal information. Lastly, the Personal Information Protection Law contains proposals for significant fines for serious violations of up to RMB 50 million or 5% of annual revenues from the prior year and may also be ordered to suspend any related activity by competent authorities.



Foreign Currency Exchange



Under the Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated in 1996 and revised in 1997, and various regulations issued by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) and other relevant PRC government authorities, RMB is convertible into other currencies without prior approval from SAFE only to the extent of current account items, such as trade related receipts and payments, interest and dividends and after complying with certain procedural requirements. The conversion of RMB into other currencies and remittance of the converted foreign currency outside PRC for the purpose of capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, requires the prior approval from SAFE or its local office. Payments for transactions that take place within China must be made in RMB. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies must repatriate foreign currency payments received from abroad. Foreign-invested enterprises may retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks subject to a cap set by SAFE or its local office. Unless otherwise approved, domestic enterprises must convert all of their foreign currency proceeds into RMB.



On October 21, 2005, SAFE issued the Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-raising and Reverse Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, which became effective as of November 1, 2005. According to the notice, a special purpose company, or SPV, refers to an offshore company established or indirectly controlled by PRC residents for the special purpose of carrying out financing of their assets or equity interest in PRC domestic enterprises. Prior to establishing or assuming control of an SPV, each PRC resident, whether a natural or legal person, must complete the overseas investment foreign exchange registration procedures with the relevant local SAFE branch. The notice applies retroactively. As a result, PRC residents who have established or acquired control of these SPVs that previously made onshore investments in China were required to complete the relevant overseas investment foreign exchange registration procedures by March 31, 2006. These PRC residents must also amend the registration with the relevant SAFE branch in the following circumstances: (i) the PRC residents have completed the injection of equity investment or assets of a domestic company into the SPV; (ii) the overseas funding of the SPV has been completed; (iii) there is a material change in the capital of the SPV. Under the rules, failure to comply with the foreign exchange registration procedures may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the violator, including restrictions on the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent company, and may also subject the violators to penalties under the PRC foreign exchange administration regulations.

On August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated Circular 142 which regulates the conversion by a foreign-funded enterprise of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. In addition, SAFE promulgated Circular 45 on November 9, 2011 in order to clarify the application of Circular 142. Under Circular 142 and Circular 45, the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of Circular 142 and Circular 45 could result in severe penalties, such as heavy fines as set out in the relevant foreign exchange control regulations. On July 4, 2014, SAFE promulgated SAFE Circular 36, which launched a pilot reform of the administration of the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of foreign-invested enterprises in certain designated areas from August 4, 2014. However, SAFE Circular 36 continues to prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from directly or indirectly using the Renminbi converted from their foreign exchange capitals for purposes beyond its business scope. On March 30, 2015, SAFE promulgated Circular 19, to expand the reform nationwide. Circular 19 will come into force and replace both Circular 142 and Circular 36 on June 1, 2015. Circular 36 allows enterprises established within the pilot areas to use their foreign exchange capitals to make equity investment and removes certain other restrictions provided under Circular 142 for these enterprises. Circular 19 will remove those restrictions for all foreign-invested enterprises established in the PRC. However, both Circular 36 and Circular 19 continue to prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from, among other things, using the Renminbi fund converted from its foreign exchange capitals for expenditure beyond its business scope, providing entrusted loans or repaying loans between non-financial enterprises.



Dividend Distributions



Under applicable PRC regulations, foreign invested enterprises (FIEs) in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a FIE in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The board of directors of a FIE has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.



After-tax profits/losses with respect to the payment of dividends out of accumulated profits and the annual appropriation of after-tax profits as calculated pursuant to PRC accounting standards and regulations do not result in significant differences as compared to after-tax earnings as presented in our financial statements. However, there are certain differences between PRC accounting standards and regulations and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, arising from different treatment of items such as amortization of intangible assets and change in fair value of contingent consideration rising from business combinations.



In addition, under the Enterprise Income Tax (EIT) Law, the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Negotiated Reduction of Dividends and Interest Rates, which was issued on January 29, 2008, the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion, which became effective on December 8, 2006, and the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation Regarding Interpretation and Recognition of Beneficial Owners under Tax Treaties, which became effective on October 27, 2009, dividends from our PRC operating subsidiaries paid to us through our Hong Kong subsidiary may be subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 10%, or at a rate of 5% if our Hong Kong subsidiary is considered a “beneficial owner” that is generally engaged in substantial business activities and entitled to treaty benefits under the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion.



Laws and Regulations Related to Employment and Labor Protection



On June 29, 2007, the National People’s Congress promulgated the Employment Contract Law of PRC (“Employment Contract Law”), which became effective as of January 1, 2008 and amended on December 28, 2012. The Employment Contract Law requires employers to provide written contracts to their employees, restricts the use of temporary workers and aims to give employees long-term job security.



Pursuant to the Employment Contract Law, employment contracts lawfully concluded prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law and continuing as of the date of its implementation shall continue to be performed. Where an employment relationship was established prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law but no written employment contract was concluded, a contract must be concluded within one month after its implementation.

On September 18, 2008, the State Council promulgated the Implementing Regulations for the PRC Employment Contract Law which came into effect immediately. These regulations interpret and supplement the provisions of the Employment Contract Law.
