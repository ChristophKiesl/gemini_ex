ITEM 1. Business
Overview
 Nutanix, Inc. ("we," "us," "our" or "Nutanix") provides a leading enterprise cloud platform, which we call the Nutanix Cloud Platform, that consists of software solutions and cloud services that power our customers’ enterprise infrastructure. Our solutions run across private-, hybrid- and multicloud environments, and allow organizations to seamlessly "lift and shift" their workloads, including enterprise applications, high-performance databases, end-user computing and virtual desktop infrastructure ("VDI") services, cloud native workloads, and analytics applications, between different cloud environments. Our goal is to provide a single, simple, open software platform for all hybrid and multicloud applications and data.
 Founded in 2009, we pioneered the hyperconverged infrastructure ("HCI") category, initially combining the disparate IT silos of compute, storage and networking into a single on-premises product which offered total cost of ownership, scalability and customer choice. We continued to innovate and developed Acropolis Hypervisor ("AHV") - our native hypervisor designed to run all virtualized applications. To give our customers even more choice, we engineered our software solutions to run on a variety of server platforms, decoupling our software from our Nutanix-branded hardware appliances and powering a variety of on-premises private cloud deployments; a significant step in our transition from a hardware to a software company. That transition has continued with the adoption of "cloud" as a mainstream IT paradigm, which has motivated IT professionals to move toward hybrid cloud architectures that allow businesses to simultaneously utilize a private cloud powered by Nutanix software, along with third-party public cloud infrastructures for maximum flexibility. We continue to transform our software solutions into a comprehensive enterprise cloud platform, based on web-scale engineering principles and with a focus on operational simplicity, which allows our customers to power nearly any scale IT deployment. Although today our customers primarily use our enterprise cloud platform to power their on-premises private cloud deployments, our solutions also simplify the complexities of multicloud environments with a single management console for automation, cost governance and compliance. The end result will be an enterprise cloud platform that empowers our customers to unify various clouds - on-premises private, public and distributed - into one seamless cloud, allowing IT to choose the right cloud for each application.
 To provide our customers with the freedom to choose the best consumption model based on their specific business needs, we have also continued to reshape our licensing by moving toward a subscription-based business model. A subscription-based business model means one in which our products, including associated support and entitlement arrangements, are sold with a defined term. For more information, see the section titled "Components of Our Results of Operations" included in Part II, Item 7, as well as Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Furthermore, as part of our transition to a subscription-based business model, we have transitioned to a sales compensation structure that is based on Annual Contract Value ("ACV"). These transitions have caused, and will continue to cause, our traditional life-of-device licensing models to become increasingly replaced by term-based licenses, providing our customers with a subscription option which are portable across hybrid- and multicloud deployments. We believe that these transitions - from hardware to software solutions, and from life-of-device to subscription models - will contribute to our long-term growth, although they have resulted in lower revenues during the period of transition. In fiscal 2021, our subscription billings increased to 89.0% of total billings, up 8 percentage points from fiscal 2020, and our subscription revenue reached $1.2 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 20.7%. In fiscal 2021, ACV billings was $594.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 17.6%.
 

The Nutanix Cloud Platform
 Leveraging the foundation of our core HCI technology, the Nutanix Cloud Platform delivers a rich set of products, solutions and services to enable our customers to manage their private cloud and, increasingly, their public and hybrid multicloud environments. All of our offerings are supported by a unified control plane, unified Application Program Interfaces ("APIs"), security, and lifecycle management. The Nutanix Cloud Platform is available in private cloud deployment, and is increasingly available on public cloud, through managed service providers and telcos, and in the future, as-a-Service.
 We recently announced continued product portfolio simplification, to help streamline the products and offerings that we have developed over the years. The description of our products and offerings below are based on our new simplified product portfolio, but will also refer, in parentheses, to the product names that we have used in the past.
 Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure – Our offerings in hybrid cloud infrastructure combine our core HCI software stack (AOS) and our native, enterprise-grade hypervisor (AHV), and also add in support for virtual networking, containers, network security and disaster recovery.
 Acropolis (AOS). AOS converges virtualization, storage, and networking services into a turnkey solution. AOS is comprised of three foundational components:
 •Virtualization. AOS supports major hypervisors, including our native AHV.
 •Storage Capabilities. Building on a distributed data fabric, AOS enables robust enterprise storage services across multiple storage protocols. Storage capabilities include snapshots and cloning, performance acceleration capabilities, such as caching, data tiering and data locality and storage optimization, such as deduplication, compression and erasure coding, along with data protection and disaster recovery features.
 •Networking Visualization and Security. AOS provides services to visualize the network, automate common network operations, secure the network and integrate with various third-party networking and security products. We supplement the network visualization capabilities of AOS with application-centric firewall services based on advanced microsegmentation technology (Nutanix Flow) that protect applications against internal and external threats, as well as data encryption.
 Acropolis Hypervisor (AHV). AHV is a native, enterprise-grade virtualization solution that is included with our enterprise cloud platform with no additional software components to license, install or manage. AHV is built upon a widely-used open source hypervisor technology, known as KVM and extends its base functionality to include additional features such as virtual machine high availability and live migration. AHV also includes such features as flexible migrations, automated workload placement, security hardening, network virtualization, data protection and disaster recovery and rich analytics.
 Our offerings in hybrid cloud infrastructure also provide for automated deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters to simplify the provisioning, operations and lifecycle management of cloud-native environments, containerized applications and microservices (Nutanix Karbon).
 In addition, our entire hybrid cloud infrastructure stack can not only be run in private cloud environments, but can also be deployed in a public cloud environment like Amazon Web Services ("AWS") bare-metal through Nutanix Clusters, and also allows the customer to move applications between private and public clouds, regardless of where they were originally deployed. Nutanix Clusters also provides a single plane to manage private and public cloud infrastructure.
 

Cloud Management – Our offerings in cloud management combine multicloud governance, orchestration and operations, for private cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud deployments. Our offerings in cloud management include our control plane providing management and analytics across the enterprise cloud platform, which delivers integrated management, capacity planning, robust operational analytics, self-service capabilities and one-click administration, and enables efficient centralized administration to manage multiple clusters within a single datacenter, or across multiple sites (Prism Pro). We also provide cloud governance (Nutanix Beam) as well as automation services that streamline application lifecycle management, provide self-service provisioning via an application marketplace, and deliver powerful multicloud orchestration (Nutanix Calm).
 Emerging Products – We have also developed a number of emerging products that complement our hybrid cloud infrastructure and cloud management offerings to further expand our customers’ ability to manage their hybrid cloud infrastructure.
 Unified Storage (Nutanix Files and Nutanix Objects) – Our Unified Storage product offering includes scale-out storage services that consolidate management of structured and unstructured data. Nutanix customers can simplify storage operations, while delivering enterprise-grade NFS and SMB files services (Nutanix Files), as well as S3-compatible object services (Nutanix Objects), at nearly any scale.
 Database Automation and Database-as-a-Service (Nutanix Era) – We also provide automated database management to simplify database administration and to efficiently manage database copies that proliferate in most IT environments (Nutanix Era). Era supports a variety of databases, both proprietary and open source, and can run both in the private datacenter and in the public cloud through Nutanix Clusters.
 Desktop-as-a-Service (Nutanix Frame) – Our Desktop-as-a-Service product offering provides a rich set of end-user computing ("EUC") services that can reduce the cost of delivering virtualized desktops and applications, while improving performance and scalability. Services include virtualization, file storage, security and networking for traditional VDI environments. We also provide desktop-as-a-service (Nutanix Frame) to deliver virtual apps or desktops to users from multiple public cloud environments and/or an enterprises private cloud datacenter, which can be easily accessed from any browser.
 Delivery of Our Solutions
 The Nutanix Cloud Platform can be deployed on-premises running on a variety of qualified hardware platforms, in popular public cloud environments such as Amazon Web Services through Nutanix Clusters, or, in the case of our cloud-based software and software-as-a-service ("SaaS") offerings, via hosted service. Non-portable software licenses for our platform are delivered or sold alongside configured-to-order appliances, with a license term equal to the life of the associated appliance. Our subscription term-based licenses are sold separately, or can also be sold alongside configured-to-order appliances. Our subscription term-based licenses typically have terms ranging from one to five years. Our cloud-based SaaS subscriptions have terms extending up to five years. We expect to continue delivering the majority of our products through subscription term-based licenses or cloud-based SaaS subscriptions.
 Our enterprise cloud platform typically includes one or more years of support and entitlements, which provides customers with the right to software upgrades and enhancements as well as technical support. Purchases of non-portable software are typically accompanied by the purchase of a separate support and entitlement agreement. Purchases of term-based licenses and SaaS subscriptions have support and entitlements built into the license.
 Our Partners
 We have established relationships with channel, OEM, ecosystem and cloud partners, all of which help to drive the adoption and sale of our solutions with our end customers, and we sell our solutions primarily through our partners. Our solutions can be purchased through one of our channel partners, original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), or directly from Nutanix.
 

Channel Partners. Our channel partners sell our solutions to end customers, and in certain cases, may also deliver our solutions to end customers through a managed or integrated offering. Our Elevate Partner Program simplifies engagement for our partner ecosystem using a consistent set of tools, resources, and marketing platforms. Our channel partners include distributors, resellers, managed service providers, telcos, global systems integrators, and independent software vendors. Arrow Electronics, Inc., a distributor to our end customers, represented 24%, 29% and 32% of our total revenue for fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Tech Data Corporation, another distributor to our end customers, represented 13%, 14% and 15% of our total revenue for fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.
 OEM Partners. OEMs typically pre-install our software on hardware appliances and sell to end customers, and our offerings may also be sold through our OEMs and delivered directly to our end customers.
Super Micro Computer, Inc. ("Supermicro") and Flextronics Systems Limited ("Flextronics") pre-install our software on Nutanix-branded NX configured-to-order hardware appliances. Dell Technologies ("Dell"), Lenovo Group Ltd. ("Lenovo"), International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), Fujitsu Technology Solutions GmbH ("Fujitsu"), Hewlett Packard Enterprise ("HPE") and Inspur Group ("Inspur") pre-install our software on their hardware to create the Dell XC Series, Lenovo Converged HX Series, IBM CS Series, Fujitsu XF Series, HPE DX Series and Inspur inMerge 1000 Series appliances, respectively. HPE also delivers our software with HPE Proliant Servers as a service through the HPE Greenlake offering. Some of our OEM partners also sell associated support offerings.
 Ecosystem Partners. We have developed relationships with a broad range of leading technology companies that help us deliver world-class solutions to our customers. Through the Technology Alliance Partner arm of our Elevate Partner Program, our developer, application, hardware and infrastructure partners receive access to resources that allow them to validate and integrate their products with Nutanix solutions and engage in joint sales training and enablement. In addition, we work closely with our technology partners through co-marketing and lead-generation activities in an effort to broaden our marketing reach and help us win new customers and retain existing ones. We have also developed and announced strategic technology partnerships that bring together best-in-class solutions across the ecosystem into integrated offerings and demonstrated interoperability and support for our customers.
 Cloud Partners. Our partnerships with public cloud providers help us to realize our vision of a hybrid multicloud. The deployment of Nutanix Clusters on AWS extends the availability of our core HCI software, along with all of our solutions, to bare metal Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances on AWS. We have also announced a partnership with Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") to offer a hybrid cloud solution on Azure by extending Nutanix Clusters to Azure environments and ultimately enabling hybrid cloud management, on-premises or in Azure, through the Azure Arc control plane.
 Our Support Programs
 Product Support. We offer varying levels of software support to our customers based on their needs. We also offer hardware support for customers who purchase the Nutanix-branded NX configured-to-order hardware appliances.
 Professional Services. We provide consulting and implementation services to customers through our professional services team for assessment, design, deployment and optimizing of their Nutanix environments. We typically provide these services at the time of initial installation to help the customer with configuration and implementation.
Our End Customers
 Our solutions serve a broad range of workloads, including enterprise applications, databases, virtual desktop infrastructure, and big data analytics, and we support both virtualized and container-based applications. We have end customers across a broad range of industries, such as automotive, consumer goods, education, energy, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media, public sector, retail, technology and telecommunications. We also sell to service providers, who utilize our enterprise cloud platform to provide a variety of cloud-based services to their customers. We had a broad and diverse base of over 20,000 end customers as of July 31, 2021, including approximately 980 Global 2000 enterprises. We define the number of end customers as the number of end customers for which we have received an order by the last day of the period, excluding partners to which we have sold products for their own demonstration purposes. A single organization or customer may represent multiple end customers for separate divisions, segments, or subsidiaries.
Growth Strategy
 Key elements of our growth strategy include:
 •Continually innovate and maintain technology leadership. Since inception, we have rapidly innovated from supporting limited applications and a single hypervisor to a full enterprise cloud platform that is designed to support a wide variety of workloads across private, public and hybrid multicloud deployments. We intend to continue to invest heavily in developing our enterprise cloud platform with new features, services and products to expand our market opportunity in both core and adjacent markets.
 •Invest to acquire new end customers. Since the completion of our first end customer sale in October 2011, we have grown to approximately 20,130 end customers. We intend to grow our base of end customers by continuing to invest in sales and marketing, leveraging our network of channel partners and OEMs, furthering our international expansion and extending our enterprise cloud platform to address new customer segments. One area of continued focus is increasing our sales to new, and expanding our sales to existing, large enterprise customers.
 •Continue to drive follow-on sales to existing end customers. Our end customers typically deploy our technology initially for a specific project or application deployment. Our sales teams and channel partners then seek to systematically target follow-on sales opportunities to drive additional purchases throughout our broader product portfolio, while also focusing on customer adoption and customer consumption of their original purchases. This land and expand strategy enables us to quickly expand our footprint within our existing end customer base from follow-on orders that in the aggregate are often multiples of the initial order.
 •Enhanced focus on renewals. In addition to our land and expand strategy described above, as part of our transition to a subscription-based model, we have enhanced our focus on renewals, which are typically associated with lower sales costs. While renewals have historically represented a small portion of our overall business, we expect that they will be a significant driver of our top-line growth as we continue in our subscription transformation.
 

•Deepen engagement with current channel, OEM, cloud and ecosystem partners and establish additional routes to market to enhance sales leverage. We have established meaningful channel partnerships globally and have driven strong engagement and commercial success with several major resellers and distributors. We believe that our OEM relationships can augment our routes to market to accelerate our growth and that there is a significant opportunity to grow our sales with our channel partners and OEMs. We intend to attract and engage new channel and OEM partners around the globe while also selling our standalone software for deployment on qualified hardware or a hosted service to maximize the availability of our solutions for our customers. We will also continue to establish partnerships with cloud and ecosystem partners to provide our customers with freedom of choice.
 •Invest in rapid growth while remaining focused on our overall financial health. We intend to continue investing in our rapid growth, while balancing such growth against our operating expenses. By maintaining this balance, we believe we can drive toward our high growth potential without sacrificing our overall financial health. Key drivers of our path towards profitability include growth in renewals happening at a much lower cost compared to new sales and continuing to leverage sales and marketing efficiencies.
 Sales and Marketing
 Sales. We primarily engage our end customers through our global sales force who directly interact with key IT decision makers while also providing sales development, opportunity qualification and support to our channel partners. We have established relationships with our channel partners, who represent many of the key resellers and distributors of datacenter infrastructure software and systems in each of the geographic regions where we operate. We also engage our end customers through our OEM partners, which license our software and package it with their hardware and sell through their direct sales forces and channel partners. We expect to continue leveraging our relationships with our channel and OEM partners, and deepening relationships with our cloud and ecosystem partners, to reach our end customers.
 Marketing. We supplement our sales efforts with marketing programs that include online advertising, corporate and third-party events, demand generation activities, social media promotions, media and analyst relations and community programs. More recently, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have transformed nearly all of our in-person marketing programs into digital experiences. For example, we converted both our 2020 and 2021 .NEXT Conferences to a completely digital format. We also establish deep integration with our ecosystem of third-party technology partners and engage in joint marketing activities with them. Our channel partners have joined our integrated partner program, the Nutanix Elevate Partner Program, which provides market development funds, preferred pricing through deal registration, sales enablement and product training, innovative marketing campaigns and dedicated account support. We also coordinate with our OEM partners on joint marketing activities.
Research and Development
 Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on improving current technology, developing new technologies in current and adjacent markets and supporting existing end customer deployments. Our research and development teams primarily consist of distributed systems software and user interface engineers. A large portion of our research and development team is based in San Jose, California. We also maintain research and development centers in India, North Carolina, Washington, Serbia, and Germany. We plan to dedicate significant resources to our continued research and development efforts and intend to continue to grow our global research and development and engineering teams to enhance our solutions, improve integration with new and existing ecosystem partners and broaden the range of IT infrastructure technologies that we converge into our enterprise cloud platform. We believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth, although they may adversely affect our profitability in the near term.
 

Research and development expense was $500.7 million, $554.0 million and $557.0 million for fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Manufacturing
 We do not manufacture any hardware. The Nutanix-branded NX series appliances, including those that are delivered by us, are manufactured for us based on our specifications by two manufacturers, Supermicro and Flextronics. Supermicro and Flextronics assemble and test the Nutanix-branded NX series appliances and they generally procure the components used in the NX series appliances directly from third-party suppliers. Our agreement with Supermicro was renewed in May 2021 for one year and will automatically renew for successive one-year periods thereafter, with the option to terminate upon each annual renewal. Our agreement with Flextronics will expire in November 2021. Distributors handle fulfillment and shipment for certain end customers, but do not hold inventory.
Backlog
 We typically accept and deliver orders within a short time frame. In general, customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty prior to delivery, and delivery schedules requested by customers in their purchase orders vary based upon each customer’s particular needs. As a result, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is a reliable indicator of future revenue.
Competition
 We operate in the intensely competitive IT infrastructure market and compete primarily with companies that sell software to build and operate private clouds, integrated systems and standalone storage and servers, as well as providers of public cloud infrastructure solutions. These markets are characterized by constant change and rapid innovation. Our main competitors fall into the following categories:
 •software providers, such as VMware, Inc. ("VMware"), that offer a broad range of virtualization, infrastructure and management products to build and operate enterprise and hybrid clouds;
 •traditional IT systems vendors, such as Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco"), Dell, HPE, Hitachi Data Systems ("Hitachi"), IBM and Lenovo, that offer integrated systems that include bundles of servers, storage and networking solutions, as well as a broad range of standalone server and storage products; 
 •traditional storage array vendors, such as Dell, Hitachi and NetApp, Inc. ("NetApp"), which typically sell centralized storage products; and
 •providers of public cloud infrastructure and SaaS-based offerings, such as Amazon.com, Inc. ("Amazon"), Google Inc. and Microsoft.
 In addition, we compete against vendors of hyperconverged infrastructure products, such as Cisco, HPE, Dell, VMware and many smaller emerging companies. As our market grows, we expect it will continue to attract new companies as well as existing larger vendors. Some of our competitors may also expand their product offerings, acquire competing businesses, sell at lower prices, bundle with other products, provide closed technology platforms, partner with other companies to develop joint solutions, or otherwise attempt to gain a competitive advantage. Furthermore, as we expand our product offerings, we may expand into new markets and we may encounter additional competitors in such markets. Additionally, as companies increasingly offer competing solutions, they may be less willing to cooperate with us as an OEM or otherwise.
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:
 •product features and capabilities;
 

•system scalability, performance and resiliency;
 •management and operations, including provisioning, troubleshooting, analytics, automation and upgrades;
 •total cost of ownership over the lifetime of the technology;
 •customer freedom of choice over, and product interoperability with third-party applications, infrastructure software, infrastructure systems and platforms and public clouds;
 •application mobility across disparate silos of enterprise computing, including public and private cloud infrastructure; and
 •complete customer experience, including usability, support and professional services.
 We are also venturing into a number of markets that are adjacent to our core HCI market, both through the expansion of HCI in hybrid multicloud as well as through our emerging products. These adjacent markets include areas such as disaster recovery, cloud management, files and object storage, database automation and database-as-a-service, and desktop-as-a-service. Competitors in these markets include large, sophisticated companies who may have more experience or longer operating histories in these markets as well as new entrants.
 We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, a larger existing customer base, broader distribution and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and employee nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of July 31, 2021, we had 290 United States patents that have been issued and 221 non-provisional patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2031 and 2039. We also leverage open source software in most of our products.
 See Item 1A, "Risk Factors," for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property.
 Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are located in San Jose, California where, under lease agreements that expire through May 2024, we currently lease approximately 439,000 square feet of space. We also maintain offices in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. We lease all of our facilities and do not own any real property. While we expect to add facilities as we grow our employee base and expand geographically, we are also evaluating our longer-term facilities plans due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for a hybrid work environment. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future and that, should it be needed, suitable additional space will be available to accommodate the expansion of our operations.
Government Regulation
 Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position as compared to prior periods. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, acquisitions, data protection and data privacy, employment and labor, and taxes could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors," for further discussion of risks related to the potential impact of government regulation on our business.
Employees and Human Capital
 We had approximately 6,080 employees worldwide as of July 31, 2021. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor organization or is a party to any collective bargaining arrangement. In certain of the European countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements in relation to the establishment of works councils and/or industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We are often required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these works councils. We have never had a work stoppage and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 We understand the importance of human capital and prioritize building our culture, talent development, compensation and benefits, and diversity and inclusion. Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
 At Nutanix, we value that our differences make us stronger: our diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives when shared, make us a more innovative and resilient team, and we can better delight and serve our customers when our teams reflect the diversity of businesses and communities we serve. Attracting, fostering, and retaining a diverse, inclusive culture is essential to the continued success of our business.
Promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in our workforce is one of our key corporate objectives, and to further support this objective we have implemented a number of initiatives, including by expanding our employee resource groups, enhancing our company-wide and unconscious bias and diversity training and overall education efforts, as well as mentorship programs, and forming Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Councils both at the executive level – led by our CEO, Rajiv Ramaswami – and the broader employee level.
Total Rewards
We believe a robust, equitable, and competitive Total Rewards portfolio is essential to attracting and retaining diverse talent that moves Nutanix forward. We design reward and recognition programs that resonate wherever our talent sits in the world. Our reward packages are carefully crafted to offer physical, mental/emotional, and financial support to our employees and their families. We regularly review our programs and encourage employee feedback about what they value most. In addition to specifically tailored packages for each country based on local market practice and the competitive landscape, we also provide a range of globally available support programs such as an Employee Assistance Program, online health engagement and child development support.
Health, Wellness, and Safety
 Our priority is the health and safety of our employees. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to implement a number of precautionary measures to ensure the continued safety of our employees. This has included the implementation of a remote work policy. We also continue to support the well-being and continued development of our now primarily remote workforce by instituting during the pandemic quarterly well-being days, during which all employees can collectively take a mental and physical break, and launching programs like quarterly well-being workshops, no-meeting Fridays, flexible work schedules, mindfulness sessions, and internal social media well-being challenges.
Growth and Development
 One of our culture principles is to Believe in Striving -- to constantly learn, continuously improve, and eternally evolve -- and to that end we invest significant resources to actively foster a learning culture throughout the company and to empower our employees to drive their personal and professional growth by equipping them with various learning programs, as well as extensive onboarding and training programs. Our learning programs are available for our employees at all levels of career progression and include digital learning programs, speed coaching sessions, customized learning workshops, management enablement and skills training for current, new and future managers, language learning programs, and employee wellness programs. We believe that by empowering our employees as they strive to grow personally and professionally, we will be able to build a flexible and resilient workforce and maintain and nurture a robust pipeline of talent to fuel our future growth and strategy.
