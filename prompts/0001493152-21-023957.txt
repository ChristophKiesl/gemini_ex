ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 
GENERAL
 
NetSol Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq CM: NTWK) is a worldwide provider of IT and enterprise software solutions to the global finance and leasing industry. We believe that our solutions constitute mission critical applications for clients, as they encapsulate end-to-end business processes, facilitating faster processing and increased transactions.
 
NETSOL’s primary sources of revenues have been licensing, subscriptions, modification, enhancement and support of its suite of financial applications, under the brand name NFS Ascent® for leading businesses in the global finance and leasing space. With constant innovation being a major part of NETSOL’s DNA, we have enabled NFS Ascent® deployment on the cloud with several implementations already live and some underway. This shift to the cloud will enable NETSOL’s new customers to opt for a subscription-based pricing model rather than the traditional licensing model.
 
NETSOL’s clients include blue chip organizations, Dow-Jones 30 Industrials, Fortune 500 manufacturers, financial institutions, global vehicle manufacturers and enterprise technology providers, all of which are serviced by NETSOL’s strategically placed support and delivery locations around the globe.
 
Founded in 1997, NETSOL is headquartered in Calabasas, California. While the Company follows a global strategy for sales and delivery of its portfolio of solutions and services, it continues to maintain regional offices in the following locations:
 

● | North America | Los Angeles Area 
--+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Europe | London Metropolitan Area, Horsham 
● | Asia Pacific | Lahore, Karachi, Bangkok, Beijing, Shanghai, Jakarta and Sydney

Company Business Model
 
NETSOL believes that our strong technology solutions offer our customers a return on their investment and allows us to thrive in a hyper competitive and mature global marketplace. Our solutions are bolstered by our people. NETSOL believes that people are the drivers of success; therefore, we invest heavily in our hiring, training and retention of top-notch staff to ensure not only successful selling, but also the ongoing satisfaction of our clients.

Simultaneously, we are able to extend services and even support development through a combination of onsite and off-site resources. This approach has allowed us to offer blended rates to our customers by employing a unique and cost-effective global development model.

OUR SOLUTIONS
 
NFS Ascent®
 
Covering the complete finance and leasing cycle starting from quotation origination through end of contract transactions, NFS Ascent® has been designed and developed for a highly flexible setting and is capable of dealing with multinational, multi-company, multi-asset, multi-lingual, multi-distributor and multi-manufacturer environments. The solution fully automates the entire financing/leasing cycle for companies of any size, including those with multi-billion-dollar portfolios. NFS Ascent® empowers financial institutions to effectively manage their complex lending and leasing portfolios, enabling them to thrive in hyper-competitive global markets.
 
NFS Ascent® is built on cutting-edge, modern technology that enables auto, equipment and big-ticket finance companies, alongside banks, to run their retail and wholesale finance business with ease. With comprehensive domain coverage and powerful configuration engines, it is architected to empower finance and leasing companies with a platform that supports their growth in terms of business volume and transactions.
 
NETSOL’s next generation platform offers a technologically advanced solution for the asset finance and leasing industry. NFS Ascent’s® architecture and user interfaces were designed based on NETSOL’s collective experience with blue chip organizations and global Fortune 500 companies over the past 40 years combined with modern UX design concepts. The platform’s framework allows auto captive and asset finance companies to rapidly transform legacy driven technology into a state-of-the-art IT and business process environment.
 
At the core of the NFS Ascent® platform is a lease accounting and contract processing engine, which allows for an array of interest calculation methods, as well as robust accounting of multi-billion-dollar lease portfolios in compliance with various regulatory standards. NFS Ascent®, with its distributed and clustered deployment across parallel application and high-volume data servers, enables finance companies to process voluminous data in a hyper speed environment.
 
Our premier solution has been developed using the latest tools and technologies and its n-tier SOA architecture allows the system to greatly improve a myriad of areas including, but not limited to, scalability, performance, fault tolerance and security. NFS Ascent® empowers users with:
 
● Improvement in overall productivity throughout the delivery organization:
 

◌ | The features of the integrated Business Process Manager, Workflow Engine, Business Rule Engine and Integration Hub provide flexibility to our clients allowing them to configure certain parts of the application themselves rather than requesting customization. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◌ | The NFS Ascent® platform and the SOA architecture allow us to develop portals and mobile applications quickly by utilizing our existing services. 
◌ | The n-tier architecture allows us to intelligently distribute processing and eases application maintenance. The loose coupling between various modules and layers reduces the risk of regression in other parts of the system as a result of changes made in one part of the system and follows proven and accepted SOA principles. 

 
● Improvement in talent acquisition and retention:
 

◌ | Because NFS Ascent® has been developed using the latest technologies and tools available in the market, it is helping us in attracting and retaining workforce equipped with the skills required to match our vision to strive for constant innovation. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
● Amplified customer satisfaction:
 

◌ | NFS Ascent® and NFS Digital empower not only the finance company and dealerships, but the end customer as well with self-service digital tools allowing a seamless customer experience throughout the customer journey from origination till contract maturity.

IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS
 
The implementation process of our products can span from nine to eighteen months depending upon the methodology, complexity and scope. The implementation process may also include related software services such as configuration, data migration, training, gaps development and any other additional third-party interfaces. Even after implementation, customers seek enhancements and additions to improve their business processes. We charge these efforts in a man-day rate.
 
Post implementation, our consultants may remain at the client site to assist the customer in smooth operations. After this phase, the regular maintenance and support services phase for the implemented software begins. In addition to the daily rate paid by the customer for each consultant, the customer also pays for all transportation-related expenses, boarding of the consultants, and a living allowance. Our involvement in all the above steps is priced to bring value to our customers and increase our profitability.
 
Cloud-enabled solutions are offered via seamless and rapid deployments. The swift speed of implementations for our cloud-ready products enables businesses to be more responsive and attain a competitive advantage.

PRICING AND REVENUE STREAMS
 
The company’s revenue streams are the outcome of the following four main areas:
 

● | Product licensing 
--+------------------------------------------------------
● | Subscription-based pricing 
● | Implementation and customization-related services 
● | Post contract support-related services 

 
License fees can range to a multi-million-dollar fee for single or multiple module implementations. License revenue is realized with traditional, non-SaaS-based agreements, whereas SaaS-based agreements do not contain license fees and are offered via flexible, value-driven, subscription-based pricing. There are various attributes which determine the level of complexity, a few of which are: number of contracts; size of the portfolio; business strategy of the customer; internal business processes followed by the customer; number of business users; amount of customization required; complexity of data migration and branch network of the customer.
 
We recognize revenue from license contracts when the software has been delivered to the customer. Implementation-related services, including configuration, data migration and third-party interfaces are recognized as the services are performed. Post customer support services are then provided on a continued basis. The annual support fee, which typically is an agreed upon percentage of overall monetary value of the license, then becomes an ongoing revenue stream realized on a yearly basis. Revenue from software services includes fixed price and time and materials-based contracts and is recognized as the services are performed.
 
Additionally, in order to avoid lumpiness in our revenues and to ensure a predictable revenue base over coming years, the business has shifted to a new pricing strategy whereby the business is now offering its cloud-ready products at SaaS/subscription-based pricing models. Rapid deployments coupled with affordable prices/payment schedules is expected to lead the business towards volume-based selling. Moreover, this value-driven pricing plan is intended to decrease the initial buy-in cost for new customers by eliminating heavy license fees and provides an alternative to current customers seeking lower software usage and maintenance costs.

(“DSEA”), (through the regional office Daimler Financial Services (“DFS”) Africa Asia Pacific), has established a “Centre of Competence” (“CoC”) in Singapore to facilitate the regional companies in product related matters.

In conjunction with our Asia Pacific region, the CoC supports DFS companies in twelve different countries in Asia and Africa and this list can increase as more DFS companies from other countries opt for NFS Ascent®.

MARKETING AND SELLING 
 
We continue our optimism that we will experience ever increasing opportunities for our product and services offerings in 2021 and beyond. The objective of our marketing program is to create and sustain preference and loyalty for NETSOL. Marketing is performed at the corporate and business unit levels. The corporate marketing department has overall responsibility for communications, advertising, public relations and management of all digital owned and paid mediums including website, social media channels and collaboration with industry partners. In addition, corporate marketing oversees central marketing and communications programs for use by each of the business units.
 
Our dedicated marketing personnel, within the regions, undertake a variety of marketing activities, including sponsoring focused client events to demonstrate our skills and products and participating in targeted conferences, webinars and holding private briefings with individual companies. We believe that the industry focus of our sales professionals and our business unit marketing personnel enhances their knowledge and expertise in these industries and will generate additional client engagements.
 
GROWTH PROSPECTS FOR NFS ASCENT®
 
Growth prospects for NFS Ascent® are linked to the constant innovation in the product and its growing customer base across different geographic and product markets. NETSOL is eyeing key international markets for growth in sales. Its sales strategy not only focuses on expansion into new geographic markets, including the Americas, Europe, and further penetration of our leading position in Asia Pacific, but also within existing markets into new verticals with targeting of Tier 2 and Tier 3 prospects as well.
 
Growth in North America is expected to come from the potential market for replacement of legacy systems as well as acquisition of new customers. NFS Ascent® is aimed at providing a highly flexible and robust solution based on the latest technology and advanced architecture for North American customers looking to replace their legacy systems. We believe that NFS Ascent® can provide substantial competitive disruption to the market’s lagging technology provided by incumbent vendors. The existing customer base may also represent latent demand for increased service and support revenues by offering business process optimization, customization and upgrade services. With a market ready product with successful implementation, the prospects for NFS Ascent® in the region are positive.
 
Further traction in Europe will come from NFS Ascent® deployed on the cloud, which will continue to allow the Europe division to support not only larger organizations, but also small and medium sized organizations including startups.
 
Growth in NETSOL’s traditionally strong base in Asia Pacific is expected through diversification across market segments to include new customers in related banking and commercial lending areas. At the same time, the existing customer base is tapped for increased service and support revenues by offering enhanced features and new solutions to emerging customer needs. In addition, there is a potential for NFS Ascent® in Asia Pacific in the form of existing customers who are looking for replacement of their current system.
 
In China, NETSOL is a leader in the leasing and finance enterprise solution domain. With this position, NETSOL continues to enjoy demand for the current NFS™ solution, as well as NFS Ascent®. NETSOL will continue strengthening its position within existing multinational auto manufacturers, as well as local Chinese captive finance and leasing companies.
 
THE MARKETS 
 
We provide our services primarily to clients in global commercial industries. In the global commercial area, our service offerings are marketed to clients in a wide array of industries including, automotive, software, banks, higher education and financial services.
 
The Asian continent, including Australia and New Zealand, from the perspective of marketing, are targeted by the Asia Pacific Region from its Bangkok, Beijing, Jakarta, Lahore, Shanghai and Sydney facilities. The marketing for our core offerings in the Americas and Europe is carried out from our Los Angeles Area and London Metropolitan Area offices, respectively.

PEOPLE AND CULTURE 
 
We believe we have developed a strong corporate culture that is critical to our success. Our key values are delivering world-class quality software, client-focused timely delivery, leadership, long-term relationships, creativity, openness and transparency and professional growth. The services provided by NETSOL require proficiency in many fields, such as software engineering, project management, business analysis, technical writing, sales and marketing, and communication and presentation skills.
 
Due to the growing demand for our core offerings and IT services, retention of technical and management personnel is essential. Our employee turnover was under 20% in 2021 with a goal to maintain the turnover level under 20% during the 2022 fiscal year and onwards. In addition, we are committed to improving key performance indicators such as efficiency, productivity and revenue per employee.
 
To encourage all employees to build on our core values, we reward teamwork and promote individuals that demonstrate these values. We believe that our growth and success are attributable in large part to the high caliber of our employees and our commitment to maintain the values on which our success has been based. We support gender diversity on a global basis. We are an equal opportunity employer with the largest concentration of female employees in Lahore, Pakistan and our U.S. headquarters.
 
NETSOL believes it should give back to the community and employees as much as possible. Certain subsidiaries of ours are located in regions where basic services are not readily available. Where possible, NETSOL acts to not only improve the quality of life of its employees, but also the standard of living in these regions. Examples of such programs are as follows:
 

● | Humanitarian Relief: We are all aware of the devastation that can be wrought by natural disasters. We have historically supported earthquake and flood relief where the need is the greatest. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Literacy Program: Launched to educate our illiterate employees, the main objective of this program is to enable these employees to acquire basic reading, writing and arithmetic skills. 
● | Higher Education and Science and Research Institutions: In order to support higher education in Pakistan, we have contributed endowments to NUST, Forman Christian College, and a few other universities who are focused on science and engineering. 
● | Noble Cause Fund: A noble cause fund has been established to meet medical and education expenses of the children of the lower paid employees. Our employees voluntarily contribute a fixed amount every month to the fund and NETSOL matches the employee subscriptions with an equivalent contribution amount. A portion of this fund is also utilized to support social needs of certain institutions and individuals, outside of NETSOL. 
● | Day Care Facility: NETSOL’s human resources are its key assets and thus we take numerous steps to ensure the provision of basic comforts to our employees. In Pakistan, the provision of outside pre-school childcare is a rarity. With this in mind, a children’s day care facility has been created near NETSOL’s offices providing employees with peace of mind knowing their children are nearby and being taken care of by qualified staff in a child friendly facility. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the facility is temporarily closed. 
● | Preventative Health Care Program: In addition to the comprehensive out-patient and in-patient medical benefits, preventive health care has also been introduced. This phased program focuses on vaccination of our employees against such diseases as Hepatitis – A/B, Tetanus, Typhoid and Flu on a routine basis. 

 
There is significant competition for employees with the skills required to perform the services we offer. We run an elaborate training program for different cadres of employees to cover technical skills and business domain knowledge, as well as communication, management and leadership skills. We believe that we have been successful in our efforts to attract and retain the highest level of talent available, in part because of the emphasis on core values, training and professional growth. We intend to continue to recruit, hire and promote employees who share our vision.
 
As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 1,447 employees; comprised of 77% technical staff and 23% non-IT personnel.

COMPETITION 
 
Neither a single company, nor a small number of companies, dominate the IT market in the space in which we compete. A substantial number of companies offer services that overlap and are competitive with those offered by NETSOL. Some of these are large computer manufacturers and computer consulting firms that have greater financial resources than NETSOL and, in some cases, may have greater capacity to perform services similar to those provided by NETSOL.
 
We compete chiefly against leading suppliers of IT solutions to the global asset finance and leasing industry, including names such as White Clarke Group, Alfa, Cassiopae, LineData, FIS, International Decision Systems (IDS) and Data Scan.
 
In the IT-based business services areas, we compete with both smaller local firms and many global IT services providers, including names such as Wipro, InfoSys, Satyam Infoway, HCL and TCS (Tata Consulting).
 
CUSTOMERS
 
NETSOL’s solutions and services cater to a broad spectrum of finance and leasing businesses, from automotive captive finance companies to equipment finance and leasing companies to large regional banks.

Current Company operations do not require specific governmental approvals. Like all companies, including those with multinational subsidiaries, we are subject to the laws of the countries in which we maintain subsidiaries and conduct operations. Pakistani law allows a tax exemption on income from exports of IT services and products up to 2025. While foreign based companies may invest in Pakistan, repatriation of their investment, in the form of dividends or other methods, requires approval of the State Bank of Pakistan.
