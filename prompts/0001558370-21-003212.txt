Item 1. BUSINESS
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as otherwise indicated by context, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “SGTX” or the “Company” refer to Sigilon Therapeutics Inc.
Overview
We are a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering a new class of therapeutics and seeking to develop functional cures for patients with chronic diseases by providing stable and durable levels of therapeutic molecules to patients. We have developed our Shielded Living Therapeutics, or SLTx, platform, which combines advanced cell engineering with cutting edge innovations in biocompatible materials and enables our product candidates to produce a wide range of therapeutic molecules that may be missing or deficient, such as proteins (including therapeutic proteins and antibodies) and hormones. We are designing our product candidates to be off-the-shelf, durable, controllable and redosable, without requiring modification of the patient’s genes or immunosuppression. Our lead product candidate, SIG-001, is designed to prevent bleeding episodes in patients with moderate-severe to severe Hemophilia A by continuously secreting human FVIII. We received acceptance of our investigational new drug, or IND, submission in the United States in August 2020 and our clinical trial application, or CTA, in the United Kingdom in May 2020. We have initiated our Phase 1/2 clinical study of SIG-001 in Hemophilia A, with the first two patients dosed in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Our SLTx platform is comprised of two primary elements: the cells and the sphere. We engineered cells to express the therapeutic molecule of choice, which are subsequently encapsulated in our proprietary spheres. Our human cell line for our internal product candidates was selected for its safety, durability, scalability and engineerability, which has been extensively tested in preclinical and clinical settings. The spheres are composed of an Afibromer outer layer, an alginate conjugated with a novel, proprietary anti-fibrotic small molecule, which was derived from 10 years of work in the MIT labs of Professors Robert Langer and Daniel Anderson. This work culminated in a series of patents and patent applications to which we obtained exclusive rights through our license agreement with MIT. We developed an inner compartment consisting of a proprietary conjugation of alginate and peptide molecules to enhance cell survival and productivity. We have observed robust in vivo preclinical results in which Afibromer alginate prevents the generation of an immune response against the biocompatible spheres and prevents fibrosis, while enabling nutrient influx and therapeutic protein efflux. 
Modularity, a key attribute of our SLTx platform, is comprised of three pillars: the cells, the sphere and the manufacturing process. In addition to the cells and the sphere described above, we have also spent significant time and resources over the last three years to create a state-of-the-art modular manufacturing platform for all potential product candidates developed using our cell and sphere components. This cost-effective manufacturing platform is designed to provide a true “off-the-shelf” product for patients. Furthermore, virtually all aspects of the platform, from raw materials to processing steps, are shared across our development programs, enabling a potentially streamlined path from discovery to clinical trials. With our modular platform, the only significant change among our internal product candidates is the expression cassette used in the cells, which we customize to express the desired therapeutic molecule. This modularity has created an efficient engine for generation of product candidates, allowing us to build a diverse pipeline.
Our SLTx platform is designed to significantly improve the management of chronic diseases by overcoming the significant limitations of cell and gene therapies and the drawbacks of current standard of care biologic-based therapies. Cell therapy and viral gene therapy have been used to replace or repair missing or defective cells or genes and continue to be evaluated as potential therapeutic interventions. Despite major improvements in the field, there are still a number of limitations that spurn activity and applicability of both cell and gene therapy, including immune rejection, requirement for immune suppression, limited eligibility, durability and variability challenges, inability to re-dose and high manufacturing costs. In contrast, our SLTx platform is designed to generate product candidates with the following advantages:

1




· | Functional Cure. A single dose of our SLTx product candidates may provide a meaningful long-term clinical benefit to patients, as well as significant health economic advantages. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Controllable Dosing. In preclinical studies, we have shown that various doses of SLTx product candidates can deliver predictable protein levels because of consistent expression of the therapeutic molecule by the engineered clonal cells. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Redosable. In preclinical studies, we have observed that doses of our investigational products can be administered repeatedly, which we believe further differentiates our cell-based approach from other modalities such as gene therapy. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Retrievable. While we do not anticipate a need for retrieval of our product candidates from a patient, we have demonstrated in non-human primates that we can retrieve the vast majority of the spheres if necessary. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Off-the-Shelf. Our SLTx product candidates are designed to be off-the-shelf, allogeneic, encapsulated cell therapies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No Integration with the Host Genome. Our cells are engineered outside the body and our clonal cells have known integration sites for the transgene, a gene that is introduced into the platform cell line using genetic engineering techniques. Upon placement, our cells remain inside of the spheres and do not interact with the host genome or circulate in the body. This feature is designed to avoid safety issues potentially caused by insertions into the host genome. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Avoidance of Pre-existing Immunity and Immune Suppression. Our platform is a non-viral engineered cell-based gene therapy and non-immunogenic. Therefore, our product candidates are not affected by pre-existing antibodies to the viral based vectors used in gene therapy approaches. In addition, our product candidates are designed to not require immune suppression or bone marrow conditioning agents. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Product Candidates
Leveraging the modularity of our platform and our scientific and preclinical work to date, we are able to advance programs in distinct therapeutic areas, including rare blood disorders, lysosomal diseases and endocrine and other chronic disorders. We are applying a strategic sequencing to the development of our portfolio, focusing on commercial potential, unmet need, opportunity to provide meaningful clinical benefit to patients, speed to proof-of-concept, clear regulatory path and easy-to-measure validated protein therapeutics and clinical endpoints. Our initial clinical trials for our product candidates will be in patients with the relevant disease for such products, rather than healthy volunteers. As a result, if the results from such clinical trials are positive, we expect to be able to proceed with Phase 3 trials studying the effectiveness of each product candidate after the completion of its initial clinical trial for each product candidate and approval by the applicable regulatory agencies. Our current pipeline of SLTx product candidates is summarized in the figure below.

2



SIG-001 is our most advanced product candidate, and is designed to prevent bleeding episodes in patients with moderate-severe to severe Hemophilia A. Unlike commercially available recombinant Factor VIII, or FVIII, indicated for temporary replacement of FVIII, which requires life-long repeat intravenous administrations, SIG-001 would be administered intraperitoneally and we expect each dose to have a duration of three to five years. Following administration through a short laparoscopic procedure into the peritoneal cavity, SIG-001 is designed to continuously secrete human FVIII protein that subsequently diffuses into the bloodstream, thereby eliminating the need for frequent administration of recombinant FVIII in these patients. We believe this approach has the potential to provide sustained, durable levels of FVIII and potentially improve long-term outcomes.
Our preclinical work for SIG-001 focused on the feasibility of the proposed approach, optimization of the product, the pharmacological and pharmacodynamic profile of released human beta-domain deleted FVIII and key safety aspects in various animal species. In in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrated that SIG-001 had dose-dependent, durable levels of FVIII and no safety or toxicology signals were identified. 
We received acceptance of our IND submission in the United States in August 2020 and CTA in the United Kingdom in May 2020. We have initiated our Phase 1/2 clinical study of SIG-001 in Hemophilia A, with the first two patients dosed in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Moreover, we are extending our reach within rare blood disorders. We are developing SIG-009 for patients with Factor VII deficiency and SIG-003 for patients with Hemophilia B.
SIG-005 is our product candidate that contains a cell line genetically modified with a non-viral vector to express human α-L-iduronidase, or IDUA, encapsulated within our spheres. SIG-005 is being developed to treat the non-neurological manifestations of mucopolysaccharidosis type 1, or MPS-1, in patients with the disease. We have completed pre-IND and scientific advisory meetings with both the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and Medicines and Health product Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, for SIG-005.
SIG-007 is our product candidate that contains a cell line genetically modified with a non-viral vector to express human alpha-galactosidase A, or AGAL, encapsulated within our spheres. SIG-007 is designed to provide continuous and prolonged release of functional enzyme at levels sufficient to produce clinical benefits and alleviate progression of the downstream aspects of Fabry disease. 
We believe our SLTx platform has significant applicability to treat a broad range of other lysosomal diseases. We are developing SIG-018 for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type 2, or MPS-2, and SIG-020 for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type 6, or MPS-6. Similar to other lysosomal enzymes, we expect lysosomal enzymes produced by our spheres to be taken up by tissues via mannose 6-phosphate receptors.

3



SIG-002 is our product candidate designed to replace islet cells for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes, or T1D. In T1D, the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells within the endocrine islets of the pancreas. Insulin deficiency results in dysregulation of glucose metabolism. In April 2018, we partnered with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, to develop cell therapies for the treatment of T1D, including SIG-002. Under the terms of the partnership, Sigilon is leading execution of the program through IND, and Lilly, a global leader in diabetes, will develop and commercialize the program worldwide. We received an upfront payment of $62.5 million as well as a $13.1 million equity investment from Lilly, and we are eligible to receive up to $165.0 million in regulatory milestones and $250.0 million in sales-based milestones and tiered, from mid-single-to-low-double digit, sales-based royalties on sales. In 2019, Lilly invested an additional $12.0 million as part of our Series B financing.
We intend to apply the modularity of our SLTx platform to develop more product candidates and explore delivery of different molecules and alternative routes of administration. We are developing SIG-015 for patients with immune mediated diseases.
Preclinical Pipeline
Given the modular nature of our platform, we have developed a framework for progressing the IND-enabling phase for each of our internal programs, which we expect to take approximately 18 months, on average, after a development candidate for a transgene construct has been nominated. At the initiation of preclinical studies for each program other than SIG-002, we first order a plasmid under GMP conditions and generate cell clones. We then select a clone based on high expression of the transgene of interest and use this clone to generate a master cell bank, or MCB, to be used in our eventual product candidate. Once a MCB has been developed, we coordinate technology transfer with our CMOs to manufacture preclinical supplies of our product candidate using GMP manufacturing processes. While we initiate the manufacturing process, we expect to also request pre-IND and pre-CTA meetings with the applicable regulatory authorities to incorporate their feedback in our preclinical process. Once preclinical material are available, we initiate toxicology studies, pharmacokinetic studies and pharmacodynamics studies for our product candidates, in vitro and, later, in vivo. Based on the results of these studies, we may then develop a proposed clinical trial design. Prior to the completion of IND-enabling preclinical studies, we work with our CMOs to create a working cell bank, which would be expanded and encapsulated to provide the cell components of the clinical supply of our product candidate. This process is intended to provide each program with the necessary data to complete our IND and CTA applications for such program. Based on our experience with the preclinical development of SIG-001 and the framework outlined above, we believe that we could submit IND or CTA filings for SIG-009, SIG-005, SIG-007 and SIG-002 by the end of 2022; however, unfavorable results from any of our pre-clinical studies, unanticipated requirements from a regulatory authority or an inability to successfully transfer manufacturing processes to a CMO could materially delay such anticipated timing or cause us to terminate any of these programs.
Strategy
Our goal is to provide functional cures to patients with chronic diseases by applying our SLTx platform to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize a new class of medicines. To achieve this vision and maximize value to stakeholders, we are executing a strategy with the following key elements:

· | Leverage our Modular Platform. We have focused our efforts on three pillars of our modular platform: (i) optimization of our engineered cell lines; (ii) optimization of our spheres; and (iii) development of scalable manufacturing processes. By leveraging these components, we believe that this strategy will enable us to rapidly and simultaneously pursue numerous product candidates in a capital-efficient manner. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focused Indication Prioritization. Given the breadth of the applicability of our platform, we prioritize product candidates based on the potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit to patients, rapid time to proof-of-concept, clear regulatory path, and validated biology and clinical endpoints. Based on this prioritization, we have focused our efforts in rare blood diseases and lysosomal diseases, in addition to our partnership with Lilly in T1D. As our platform is de-risked, we expect to target therapeutic areas and chronic diseases of increased complexity and prevalence. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Further Strengthen our Differentiated, Proprietary and Cost-Efficient Manufacturing Capability. We have designed our manufacturing processes for reproducibility and speed. In addition, we have scaled our process for our planned additional Phase 1/2 studies. We expect to continue to invest in our manufacturing platform and leverage our modularity as we further scale-up our proprietary processes. We believe that, at commercial scale, our cost of goods will be similar to monoclonal antibodies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Driving Innovation with our Strong Patient-first Culture. Since our formation, we have established a highly collaborative, patient-first culture that drives our passion for innovation. Our patient-first culture has allowed us to understand the needs of patients and their caregivers, including the need for innovative medicines. We have leveraged our commitment to science and our location to attract scientific talent and experienced leaders, which underlies our commitment to the patient communities we serve. In addition, we have assembled a board and scientific advisors with deep expertise in research, development, regulatory affairs and manufacturing across the therapeutic areas that we are initially targeting, and that are guided by the needs of the patient community. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maximizing Value Creation. We have assembled a management team with experience in the development and commercialization of therapeutics globally, particularly in rare diseases, and can build our own worldwide development, marketing and sales organization due to the limited commercial infrastructure required to serve rare disease markets. In other more prevalent chronic diseases, we believe that executing targeted strategic partnerships for select indications or regions of the world would be beneficial to expand and accelerate access of our technology to broader patient populations worldwide, as demonstrated by our partnership with Lilly.

Limitations of Gene and Cellular Therapies
Many diseases are a result of loss or dysfunction of cells or a component produced by these cells. The defect can occur as a result of an inherited genetic defect or occur later in life due to several factors such as autoimmunity. There is a long history in the medical community of replacing missing or defective cells, from blood transfusions to bone marrow transplants, activated immune cells in oncology and cadaveric islet cells for T1D. There are two broad classes of cell therapy: autologous, whereby cells are obtained from the patient, and allogeneic, whereby cells are obtained from a third-party human donor. Despite the major developments and improvements in the industry, both types of therapies are associated with challenges related to acquisition of cells, manufacturing, clinical utility and safety.
Immune rejection is primarily a contact-dependent cell mediated process. A challenge to the therapeutic use of allogeneic cells has been the targeted destruction of the cells by the immune system unless patients are treated with an immunosuppressive regimen. One strategy employed to prevent immune rejection, outside of immune suppression, is the encapsulation of cells to prevent immune cell contact. Encapsulation using biopolymers such as alginate have been extensively studied, including in human clinical trials. While these systems proved safe, the functionality was lost due to an immune response to the foreign material.
More recently, advances in genetics have enabled the engineering of cells to increase function or produce therapeutic molecules. These techniques can be applied to either autologous or allogeneic cell products. A recent example of autologous cell therapy is the approval of chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR-Ts, for the treatment of particular cancers. This has spurned much activity in the expanded utility for cell therapy. However, the use of these types of therapies is limited by a range of issues, including:

· | Limited Therapeutic Application. Given the specialized nature of cell therapies, they have been designed for specific indications and lack the inherent platform flexibility to be rapidly applied to therapeutics across chronic diseases. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Limited Durability. Allogeneic cell therapies have had limited durability due to the fast immune rejection by the host immune system. This limitation makes these therapies less efficacious in the treatment of chronic disease. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5




· | Safety Concerns. Many allogeneic cell/tissue therapies such as islet cell transplantation require lifelong immunosuppression to prevent immune rejection, which is associated with significant morbidity. The use of immunosuppression restricts their use to the most severe patients. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Inability to Scale in a Cost-Effective Manner. Autologous cell therapies are derived from a patient's own cells to avoid rejection by the immune system. This results in a one-to-one manufacturing process for each individual patient, which is costly and difficult to scale, and requires a complex supply chain that can delay treatment for critically ill patients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gene therapy is used to repair a deficiency by replacing a gene of interest with heterologous expression in the body, usually with the help of a packaging virus. This therapeutic modality has had some success with delivery of systemic protein deficiencies when the transgene is packaged and delivered via a viral vector. Local gene delivery in the eye has proven effective in rare genetic disorders. However, a range of similar issues to cell therapy has also limited the use of viral and non-viral integrating medicines such as gene therapies and gene editing, including:

· | Use of Immunosuppression. Immunosuppressive agents are used to dampen immune responses against tissues transfected by viral vectors used for gene therapy, such as adeno-associated viruses, or AAVs, and other viral integrating vectors. This approach compromises the patient's immune system, which can result in multiple adverse side effects. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pre-Existing Immunity. AAVs occur naturally in the environment and infect an estimated 70 percent of adults, which can lead to development of pre-existing immunity in many patients. This pre-existing immunity precludes patients from being eligible to enroll in clinical trials and to receive approved therapies. Based on recently published data from a study of Hemophilia A patients, it was estimated that at least 25-40% of study subjects were excluded from treatment because of immunity to the AAV vectors used to deliver the gene therapy. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Durability and Variability Challenges. There are few large-scale clinical trials completed with gene therapy to date. The data that are available for gene therapy-based FVIII programs have demonstrated that hFVIII levels in patients treated with gene therapy have initially risen in the first year, then expression waned over time. We believe these results suggest that the durability of gene therapy for Hemophilia A is likely limited for the average patient. Additionally, there is significant variability of expression levels between patients in the same dose cohort in these clinical studies for hemophilia patients. This makes predictability of patient response to a given dose very challenging. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Safety Concerns. Potential for integration with the host genome may present unknown safety risks. In addition, off-target or unintended genetic modifications can arise from the use of gene therapies or genome editing tools. Because viral gene therapies can affect more than one type of cells, viruses may transfect cells other than the targeted cells and cause potential for other safety concerns. If this happens, healthy cells may be damaged, causing other illness or diseases. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Inability to Redose or Remove. Currently, viral gene therapy can only be delivered once due to the strong immune response to the virus, precluding repeat dosing. Once a patient receives a viral gene therapy, that therapy cannot be stopped or reversed. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Limited Access Due to High Cost. Currently, high cost of goods and high average wholesale prices are associated with gene therapies, making access to such therapies on a global basis challenging. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Platform—Shielded Living Therapeutics
In order to overcome the limitation of existing therapies, we have developed our SLTx platform, which combines advanced cell engineering with cutting-edge innovations in biocompatible materials to pioneer a new class of therapeutics. Using the SLTx platform, we are able to produce a wide range of therapeutic molecules that may be missing or deficient,

such as proteins and hormones. We are designing our product candidates to be off-the-shelf, durable, controllable and redosable, without requiring modification of the patient's genes or immunosuppression. We engineer cells, which are subsequently encapsulated in our proprietary hydrogel spheres. The spheres are composed of an outer layer comprising our Afibromer alginate, an alginate conjugated with a novel, proprietary anti-fibrotic small molecule, and an inner compartment consisting of a proprietary conjugation of alginate and peptide molecules to enhance cell survival and productivity. We have observed robust in vivo preclinical results demonstrating that the Afibromer alginate prevented the generation of an immune response against the biocompatible spheres and prevented fibrosis, while enabling nutrient influx and therapeutic protein efflux. As the cells remain encapsulated in the spheres, they are designed not to interact with the host genome. The first product candidates will be placed in the body through a short laparoscopy procedure. Using our SLTx platform, our goal is to provide functional cures to patients with chronic diseases.

Our SLTx platform is comprised of two primary elements.

· | The Cells. Our current allogeneic human cell line used in our internal programs was selected for its safety, durability, scalability and engineerability. We believe this approach allows us to stably integrate a high-expressing transgene, with the potential to create a self-renewing transgene-expressing cell population to enhance durability and manufacturing scalability. The same parental cell bank is currently used for our internal pipeline programs. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Sphere. We encapsulate the cells in our proprietary biocompatible matrix, formatted as 1.5 mm spheres, consisting of (i) an inner compartment consisting of a proprietary conjugation of alginate and peptide molecules to enhance cell survival and productivity and (ii) an outer immune-shielding hydrogel layer containing our Afibromer alginate. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to bring our SLTx product candidates to patients, we have designed our manufacturing process for reproducibility, flexibility, speed and low cost of goods. We use a simple validated allogeneic cell-based manufacturing process for our internal pipeline programs and follow the typical cadence of creation of a clonal master cell bank, followed by a working cell bank, and, finally, expansion of a working cell bank vial for each manufacturing run. The Afibromer alginate is created by conjugating the small molecule to the requisite alginate while the inner layer of the sphere is created by conjugating a peptide to the requisite alginate. Using a proprietary manufacturing process, the biomaterials are then used to encapsulate the cells, forming a sphere with the Afibromer alginate on the outside and the cells inside the sphere with the peptide alginate biomaterial. This encapsulation process is consistent and has been scaled for clinical development. In addition, in line with other cell-based therapies, our manufacturing process provides the ability to optimize our candidate products by increasing or decreasing the volume of spheres manufactured and placed into the patient as well as the number 

7



of cells placed into each sphere. All components are manufactured under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, by our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs.
Advantages of Our SLTx Platform
Our SLTx platform is designed to significantly improve the management of chronic diseases by overcoming the drawbacks of current standard of care biologic-based therapies and the significant limitations of cell and gene therapies. We believe our SLTx product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, can be placed in the body and remain functional for years and potentially serve as "therapeutic factories" for diseases or conditions where a particular protein or cell is deficient. We believe our SLTx platform may provide the following potential advantages: 

· | Functional Cure. We believe that a single dose of our SLTx product candidates could provide a meaningful long-term clinical benefit to patients as well as significant health economic advantages. Our SLTx platform is designed to harness the power of cell therapies to do what these genetically modified cells are designed to do by mimicking the function of endogenous cells. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Controllable Dosing. We have observed in preclinical studies that various doses of SLTx product candidates delivered consistent, dose dependent expression of the therapeutic molecule by the engineered clonal cells, which we believe supports predictable dosing in humans. We believe that controllable dosing has the potential to improve the safety profile of our product candidates and to better predict clinical outcomes for patients. This approach also offers the potential to tailor dosing to fit a patient's needs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Redosable. In preclinical studies, we have observed that doses of our investigational products can be administered repeatedly, which we believe further differentiates our cell-based approach from other modalities such as gene therapy. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Retrievable. While we do not anticipate a need for retrieval of our product candidates from a patient, we have demonstrated in non-human primates that we can retrieve the vast majority of the spheres if necessary. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Modularity. Virtually all aspects of the SLTx platform are shared across our internal development programs, enabling a potentially streamlined path from discovery to clinical trials. With our modular platform, the only significant change amongst our internal product candidates is the expression cassette used in the cells, which we customize to express the desired therapeutic molecule. This modularity has created an efficient engine for generation of product candidates, allowing us to build a diverse pipeline. We also believe our plans to manufacture large cryopreserved lots in a fully automated encapsulation system will result in cost of goods similar to monoclonal antibodies and significantly lower than existing cell or gene therapies with potential ability for global distribution. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Off-the-Shelf. Our SLTx product candidates are designed to be off-the-shelf, allogeneic, encapsulated cell therapies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No Integration with the Host Genome. Our cells are engineered outside the body and our clonal cells have known integration sites for the transgene, a gene that is introduced into the platform cell line using genetic engineering techniques. Upon placement, our cells remain inside of the spheres and do not interact with the host genome or circulate in the body. This feature is designed to avoid safety issues potentially caused by insertions into the host genome. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Avoidance of Pre-existing Immunity and Immune Suppression. Our platform is a non-viral engineered cell-based gene therapy and non-immunogenic. Therefore, our product candidates are not affected by pre-existing antibodies to the viral based vectors used in gene therapy approaches to the viral based vectors used in gene therapy approaches. In addition, our product candidates are designed not to require immune suppression or bone marrow conditioning agents. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Broad Therapeutic Application. We believe our SLTx product candidates have the potential to provide functional restoration for millions of patients with chronic diseases. While gene therapy offers the promise of clinical results after a single dose, its eligibility is limited. We aim to address these limitations by offering treatment to patients with preexisting immunity to gene therapy vectors.

The attributes of our SLTx approach are compared versus other therapeutic approaches in the table below:
SLTx Offers a Compelling Path to Functional Cures
Comparison vs. Other Therapeutic Approaches
Modularity of Our SLTx Platform
Modularity is a key pillar of our strategy as the SLTx platform can be rapidly adapted to new therapeutic programs using the same parental cell line and biomaterial components yielding an efficient engine which is being applied to multiple product candidates. This platform approach to development gives us significant synergies in manufacturing, translation from idea to IND ready product candidate as well as the ability to leverage prior completed studies. In addition, we have developed proprietary processes for producing consistent and larger scale batches that are suitable for clinical development; which includes a novel process for automated continuous cell encapsulation and the potential to cryopreserve the product.

The Cells
For our current internal programs, we have selected a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line as the parental cell line. The selection was made after reviewing certain properties and characteristics. These include: prior human experience, amenable to genetic engineering, non-transformed, contact inhibited, macrophage-like properties to clear debris and demonstrated long-term survival within the biopolymer sphere. This parental cell line has been engineered to produce over 25 therapeutic proteins to date. We engineer the parental cell line in a manner that does not employ viral vectors and is designed to produce an engineered cell line that expresses high levels of the desired therapeutic molecule using a customized expression cassette with a heterologous transgene. Each transgene and expression cassette is tailored for maximal expression of the therapeutic product candidate. We have optimized the promoters, insulators, polyA and signal sequences for our parental cell line, enabling us to use different transgenes. The engineered cell line is cloned, master and working cell banks are created and tested under cGMP conditions for transgene insertion sites, passage and chromosomal stability. The cells produced by our engineered cell lines have proven particularly amenable to encapsulation because they allow us to have self-renewing, long-lived population of cells. As with normal tissues, cells in the sphere have a slow turnover rate. This parental cell line has been used in several Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials for encapsulated cell technologies developed by third parties to treat ophthalmologic conditions and central nervous system, or CNS, diseases, with no significant safety signals reported.
The Sphere
Our name is derived from sigilo—a Spanish word meaning stealth. Stealth is a key attribute of our SLTx platform, which we are developing to harness the power of therapeutic cells without inducing an immune response. Our underlying technology was derived from 10 years of work in the MIT labs of Professors Robert Langer and Daniel Anderson to identify ways to prevent the foreign body response to implanted biomaterials. This work culminated in the discovery of (i) a family of novel small molecules with anti-fibrotic properties that could be applied to the outer layer of an alginate sphere that prevented immune response to the sphere in preclinical studies and (ii) optimal sphere sizes. This technology is protected by a series of patents and patent applications, which we have exclusively licensed from MIT. This work, which included observations of preclinical durability in rodents and non-human primates, was described in a series of publications in Nature Journals from 2016 to 2020.

We have built upon the MIT technology to further refine the sphere configuration, composition and related manufacturing processes. We have developed a dual-layer sphere which enables us to create improved configurations for the outer layer and inner compartment. In designing the outer layer, we selected a small molecule from the MIT library, which when conjugated with the alginate, creates our Afibromer alginate that we use as an outer hydrogel coating for our spheres. We designed the inner compartment of the sphere to promote viability and productivity of the encapsulated cells. Specifically, the inner compartment of the spheres consists of sodium alginate monomers that form an alginate hydrogel chemically linked to a binding peptide. The inner compartment is designed to enable optimization for different cell types. The hydrogel and Afibromer alginate are sourced and manufactured under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs.

The Manufacturing Process
We have spent significant time and resources since we began substantial operations in 2017 to create a state-of-the-art manufacturing platform that is modular for all product candidates developed using our cell and sphere components. Each of the major elements of the platform, cell line, outer layer matrix, inner layer matrix, are manufactured under cGMP conditions. Significant process development work has been performed to provide scalable cost-effective approaches for each of these platform elements. As the process for manufacture of all three elements is modular and does not differ by program, it may enable significant cost and time benefits to each program. For sphere manufacturing for all programs, we use a dual lumen needle to generate the sphere. The cells with their matrix are in the inner lumen, while the Afibromer alginate is in the outer lumen. As the droplet is pulled from the needle it hits a bath and crosslinks forming a dual layer sphere. We have designed this encapsulation process for reproducibility, flexibility, speed and uniformity across all programs. These investments in our manufacturing platform should enable us, at scale, to achieve cost of goods on the order of monoclonal antibodies, if our product candidates are approved.

Foundational data on our SLTx platform
We have performed several safety and durability studies using sphere components. Third-party in vivo studies have shown that alginate spheres of similar composition can remain intact in the body for over nine years with no reported adverse effects. In extensive preclinical testing, conducted with our specific sphere composition to support our regulatory filings, we observed no toxicity. Chronic toxicity and local tolerance testing showed that the sphere components were well tolerated in Non-Human Primates, or NHPs, up to 12 months. In addition, empty spheres were not found to be sensitizing, cytotoxic, mutagenic, an irritant, or pyrogenic. The intraperitoneal administration of empty or high and low dose SIG-001 spheres was well tolerated, with no adverse control or test article-related effects observed in long-term safety studies. The spheres used in SIG-001 were also observed to be biocompatible, and SIG-001 was shown to be non-cytotoxic and non-mutagenic in preclinical studies. We also observed no acute systemic toxicity following injection of empty sphere extracts in mice.
All the preclinical work examining the safety of the spheres and its components was completed for SIG-001 and regulatory agencies have acknowledged the potential to leverage these data in subsequent filings for other product candidates. We believe the ability to utilize our existing safety data for the sphere components significantly reduces the risk to future programs and decreases cost and time to subsequent filings. Below is a summary of the relevant preclinical studies.

Six-month and twelve-month NHP Study. We examined chronic toxicity and local tolerance of a single dose of empty spheres, or SIG-000, at doses at least 5x higher than the expected maximum human dose in Cynomolgus monkeys by administration into the bursa omentalis or into the general peritoneal space via implantation through an endoscopic trocar. There were no SIG-000-related toxicities observed on clinical pathology endpoints in Cynomolgus monkeys at either six months or 12 months after administration. The SIG-000 spheres implanted into the intraperitoneal cavity were well tolerated with no notable adverse effects.

12



Broken Sphere Study. An additional sphere tolerability study was conducted upon regulatory agency request in which we broke 50% of the final SIG-001 product including cells prior to implantation to mimic a worst-case scenario for sphere integrity. An independent toxicology report found no adverse findings of note including any issues with the cells which were artificially enabled to escape the sphere in vivo.
Redosing and Retrievability Studies. Spheres were retrieved on explant to evaluate integrity (intact vs. broken spheres), which showed that on average 87.7% of empty spheres and above 92.7% of all spheres in three SIG- 001 doses remained intact to the end of the study at Week 26. We expect that the integrity for undisrupted spheres in vivo will be much higher due to the contribution of the retrieval procedure to sphere breakage in this study.
Mode of Delivery
We have explored a variety of anatomical locations for systemic or local delivery of our product candidates. For our first programs in rare blood disorders and lysosomal diseases, where large levels of systemic protein are required, we selected the general peritoneal space delivery through a laparoscopic trocar/catheter. This minimally invasive surgical procedure can be performed under general anesthesia in most patients in less than 30 minutes. Nevertheless, we are working on a simplified procedure for sphere administration into the peritoneal cavity. For indications in which smaller amounts of therapeutics will be required, such as immune-mediated conditions, we are developing alternative routes of administration.
Expansion of the Modulatory Toolbox
The potential to quickly and efficiently pursue multiple therapeutics across diverse disease areas is an important aspect of our platform. For specific indications or needs, we believe that adding another modular tool may be required. We are pursuing several such tools as part of our SLTx platform, which we believe can be leveraged across our current or future programs. These tools include:

· | Combination Therapy. Our approach of placing transgenes into our platform cells outside the body opens the possibility to produce multiple therapeutic molecules at the same time with any desired ratio and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13



encapsulated in the same sphere. The potential to provide combination therapeutics may allow us to approach diseases that require a multi-prong approach for adequate treatment.

· | Local Implantation. Our SLTx platform lends itself to implantation in various anatomical locations. We believe that anatomically localized implantation in an effort to deliver the desired levels of therapeutic has the potential to achieve efficacy and lower systemic exposure could have safety implications. We have explored intravitreal implantation for ocular delivery, delivery into the CNS space and we are considering other locations for implantation such as intra-articular. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Tunable. We believe that for particular diseases it may be critical to be able to exogenously regulate the therapeutic protein(s). While our early pipeline in rare blood disorders and lysosomal diseases are designed to have wide therapeutic windows and flat consistent dosing, we are exploring indications in the endocrine and autoimmune spaces that may require the ability to exogenously tune the therapeutic levels by the patient or physician. We have developed such systems and are exploring their use in endocrine diseases such as parathyroid hormone therapy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sense and Respond. The precise endogenously regulated system found in islet cells can be recapitulated into our current cell line using tools developed over the last decade in systems biology. Here entire circuits can be placed in our cells using our technology so that it may sense the local environment and produce therapeutic in response to the endogenous factor. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Partnerships and the Breadth of Opportunity of our Product Platform
We believe our SLTx platform has the potential to offer a new, distinct modality by which to treat many serious, chronic diseases. As a result, we believe our SLTx platform offers the potential to treat a wide range of chronic diseases representing an over $200 billion commercial opportunity. Taking into consideration the broad potential of our technology to address many therapeutic areas, we plan to partner selected indications with pharmaceutical companies that have complementary expertise and capabilities in order to maximize the value of our technology and expand patient access.
 In April 2018, we announced our first strategic pharmaceutical collaboration through a partnership with Lilly to leverage the SLTx platform to develop encapsulated cell therapies for the treatment of T1D. Under the terms of the partnership:

· | Sigilon is leading execution of the program through an initial IND; Lilly, a global leader in diabetes, will develop and commercialize the program worldwide; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sigilon received an upfront payment of $62.5 million, and a $13.1 million equity investment and is eligible to receive up to $165.0 million in regulatory milestones and $250.0 million in sales-based milestones and tiered, from mid-single-to-low-double digit, sales-based royalties on sales of SIG-002. In 2019, an additional $12.0 million was invested by Lilly as part of our Series B financing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, Sigilon has formed several strategic research collaborations with leading academic institutions including The Massachusetts Institute of Technology—Synthetic Biology Center and Boston University's Biological Design Center (Biomedical Engineering) with focus on further enhancing the capabilities and breadth of applications of our SLTx platform.
Rare Blood Disorders
Hemophilia is a rare blood disorder caused by mutation in the gene for the particular clotting factor protein needed for appropriate hemostasis, for example form a blood clot. These mutations may prevent the clotting protein from working properly or may be missing altogether. Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B are characterized by a deficiency in FVIII and FIX, respectively. They are the most common forms of the disease as they are both linked to the X chromosome and thus only require one defective gene in males for the disease to manifest. The clotting cascade contains many other proteins 

14



required for hemostasis. Autosomal recessive hemophilia disorders such as FVII, FX, FV and others are much less prevalent as they require two defective genes and may occur equally in males and females. These rare and ultra-rare diseases can be devastating for the patient as factor replacement is not currently available.
Hemophilia A
Our most advanced SLTx product candidate is SIG-001, an investigational therapy in development for the prevention of bleeding episodes by Hemophilia A. For this indication, we designed human cells to express high levels of hFVIII. In preclinical studies, after placement of spheres containing these cells in mice, we observed sustained, therapeutically relevant levels of FVIII in plasma. In a mouse model of Hemophilia A, levels of hFVIII were sustained over time, in a dose-proportionate manner and resulted in normalization of excessive bleeding following a tail clipping test. We were granted Orphan Drug designation for SIG-001 for the treatment of Hemophilia A by the FDA in August 2019 and by the EMA in November 2020, which relates to the European Union but does not include the United Kingdom. In the first half of 2020, we submitted a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, in the United Kingdom and an IND in the United States for SIG-001 for the treatment of Hemophilia A, which have been accepted by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, and the FDA, respectively. We initiated our first clinical studies for SIG-001 in Hemophilia A in 2020, with the first two patients dosed in our Phase 1/2 clinical study in the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect to complete enrollment of our Phase 1/2 clinical study of SIG-001 in Hemophilia A prior to the end of 2021.
Indication / opportunity
FVIII is an essential blood-clotting protein deficient in patients with Hemophilia A. In the cascade below, FVIII binds activated factor IX along with calcium and phospholipid. This complex then converts factor X to activated factor X to facilitate the downstream clotting cascade. Specifically, activated FVIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin, and a clot is formed. FVIII activity is greatly reduced in patients with Hemophilia A, and, therefore, factor replacement therapy is necessary.
Clotting Cascade
Patients with Hemophilia A are divided into three categories according to their endogenous plasma FVIII activity levels: severe (< 1%), moderate (1%-5%), and mild (> 5%-< 40%). Patients with the severe form experience spontaneous bleeding and hemorrhage after minor trauma about one to six times in a month, including joint bleeds and intramuscular hemorrhage. Joint bleeds are a common finding in hemophilia patients and are the hallmark of a severe form of the disease. If left untreated, frequent joint bleeds can result in joint damage and severely impacts the quality of life of the patient. In 

15



moderate form, the affected patients usually experience excessive bleeding after mild to moderate injuries, while patients with a mild form of the disease bleed excessively after surgery or major trauma.
The Hemophilia A market worldwide is estimated at approximately $8 billion, as of 2020. The severe or moderate Hemophilia A patient population is estimated to be approximately 10,000 patients in the United States and approximately 95,000 worldwide. Most of these patients are treated with prophylactic recombinant FVIII intravenous infusion several times per week as well as additional infusions for bleeding episodes. We estimate that, as of 2018, approximately 29,000 patients with moderate to severe Hemophilia A in the United States and Europe would be eligible for treatment with SIG-001, if approved.
Limitations of current therapies
Hemophilia A has been treated with FVIII factor-replacement therapy, with a well-established safety profile, which has been documented for over 30 years. Currently, the standard of care in the United States and Europe is to offer primary prophylactic FVIII infusions to patients with severe Hemophilia A. According to the 2018 World Hemophilia Foundation Annual Survey, more than 11 billion individual units of replacement FVIII are used each year worldwide, resulting in a well-established safety profile.
As the half-life of FVIII is relatively short, infusions of factor result in peaks of activity and intermittent periods of suboptimal coverage, or peaks and troughs. Extended half-life FVIII products have improved the dosing for patients extending dosing frequency from every few days to two to three times a week. In Hemophilia A, approximately 30% of naive patients have a risk of developing an immune response against the therapeutic to levels that significantly increase factor clearance and thus decreases factor activity in these patients. This phenomenon is known in the biologics world as anti-drug antibodies, or ADAs, or for hemophilia, inhibitors. This serious manifestation renders the factor replacement ineffective. Current factor replacement therapies have limitations, including treatment burden, kinetics (peaks/troughs), morbidity and mortality from breakthrough bleeds, including chronic joint disease, inhibitor development, as well as risk of thrombotic events, which can be fatal, and coagulation test interference with novel non-factor therapies, such as emicizumab.
Our Solution—SIG-001
SIG-001 is our most advanced product candidate, which is designed to prevent bleeding episodes in patients with moderate-severe to severe Hemophilia A. Our preclinical work for SIG-001 focused on the feasibility of the proposed approach, optimization of the product candidate, the pharmacological and pharmacodynamic activity of released human beta-domain deleted FVIII and key safety results in various animal species. In in vitro and in vivo models, we observed that SIG-001 had dose-dependent, durable levels of FVIII expression and no safety or toxicity signals were identified.
Unlike commercially available recombinant FVIII indicated for temporary replacement of FVIII, which require life-long repeat intravenous administrations, SIG-001 is designed to be administered intraperitoneally and we expect patients to be dosed in intervals of at least three to five years. Following a laparoscopic administration into the greater sac of the peritoneal cavity, SIG-001 is designed to continuously secrete hFVIII protein that subsequently diffuses into the bloodstream, thereby eliminating the need for frequent administration of Hemophilia A treatments in these patients. We believe this approach has the potential to provide sustained, long-lasting FVIII levels and potentially improve long-term outcomes.
Preclinical Data
We conducted multiple preclinical studies to optimize the conjugation levels of the outer layer small molecule, for minimal immune response, and the inner compartment peptide, to promote therapeutic protein expression. In vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies were conducted to evaluate expression of hFVIII by encapsulated and non-encapsulated cells. In vivo studies were completed in both immune competent and immune deficient mice, or NSG mice. NSG mice were used for longer term studies in order to avoid the expected inhibitor formation against the human protein commonly expected to be observed in rodent models. In order to assess efficacy and establish dosing, we evaluated SIG-001 in immune competent Hemophilia A knockout mice, or Hem A mice, whose defect in the FVIII gene recapitulates human 

16



disease, and in which efficacy can be assessed by measuring tail bleeding time after being clipped. Using Hem A mice, we assessed the efficacy of SIG-001-released FVIII activity and the dose-response relationship of FVIII release from SIG-001. The pharmacokinetic profile of hFVIII protein released from the spheres was also studied in NHP. We also conducted a study of the excretion of radiolabeled small molecule-modified alginate in rodents.
As shown in the figure below, the bleeding times of Hem A mice receiving SIG-001, in one cohort, approached those of wild type mice without a bleeding disorder while the bleeding times of Hem A mice receiving control spheres, containing non-engineered cells in another cohort, were significantly higher than bleeding times observed in wild type mice, indicating that control spheres were not able to restore hemostasis in Hem A mice, as expected. All spheres were placed via laparotomy into the peritoneal space of Hem A mice. On day 7 we assessed the mice for bleeding time. Hem A mice receiving SIG-001 had significantly shorter bleeding times compared to animals treated with control spheres, as shown in the figure below.
Bleeding Time in Wild Type and Hem A Mice
Following Administration of SIG-001
​ ​​ ​​
The average bleeding times (in seconds) and SEM for each group were plotted. * p<0.05 comparing Hem A mice treated with SIG-001 vs Control Spheres (non-engineered cells). Numbers of animals per group are: WT mice: N = 6, Hem A Mice (HA) + SIG-001 Spheres: N = 8, Hem A mice + Control Spheres: N = 7.
Dose Ranging Study
We assessed the relationship between SIG-001 sphere dose and plasma hFVIII levels in Hem A mice. SIG-001 spheres were placed via laparotomy into the peritoneal space at a range of doses. On day six, we collected plasma samples and measured hFVIII activity using a chromogenic FVIII activity assay. As depicted in the figure below, administration of SIG-001 resulted in dose dependent, but non-linear expression of, therapeutic hFVIII activity levels across all doses given to Hem A mice.

17



HFVIII Activity in Plasma from Hem A Mice
after Administration of Different Doses of SIG-001
We administered medium and high doses of SIG-001 in NSG mice in order to assess the durability of expression of hFVIII. We measured hFVIII activity levels in the mid and high dose groups at three time points in NSG mice. As illustrated in the figure below, we observed a durable dose dependent expression of hFVIII beyond six months, at which point the study was terminated. Intraperitoneal administration of both doses of SIG-001 spheres were well tolerated, with no adverse effects noted.
Durability of Expression of hFVIII in Two Different Doses of SIG-001 in NSG Mice
Non-GLP Pharmacokinetic Study of SIG-001 Placed in the Abdominal Cavity of Monkeys
We administered SIG-001 intraperitoneally via laparoscopic procedure in immune competent Cynomolgus monkeys. The study examined plasma FVIII concentration and activity of hFVIII and FVIII inhibitor level throughout the 

18



28-day study period. SIG-001 spheres did not produce adverse effects on mortality, body weight, clinical pathology, macroscopic observations, organ weights, or histopathology. At necropsy, retrieved sphere hFVIII production, morphology, fibrosis and cell viability were examined. In immune competent NHPs, human cells secreting FVIII in SIG-001 are expected to induce inhibitor formation due to the xenogeneic response to the human protein and potentially accelerated immune response, therefore duration of this single dose pharmacokinetic study was limited to 28±3 days.
hFVIII plasma concentrations generally increased through approximately Day 9 and subsequently declined to baseline by approximately day 16 due the monkeys' immune response against hFVIII. Onset of hFVIII inhibitor development between Day 9 and Day 11 corresponded to declining plasma hFVIII levels. The levels of FVIII inhibitor remained elevated until Day 28. In addition, at Day 28, the extracted spheres had minimal fibrosis associated with the xenogeneic response and more than 95% of the cells were viable, while still expressing hFVIII, as can be seen in the figure below. Cumulatively, with this study we were able to demonstrate plasma concentrations of hFVIII produced by SIG-001 following intraperitoneal administration to NHPs.
SIG-001 Non-Human Primate Data Confirm Murine Studies
​ ​​ ​​
Quantification of hFVIII in Cynomolgus monkey plasma samples was conducted using an electrochemiluminescence assay. Points represent the average signal in relative light units (RLU) of 3 animals administered intraperitoneally at 6 ml/kg dose of SIG-001 (error bars represent standard deviation). The development of inhibitors against hFVIII was assessed using a Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay. Points represent the average Bethesda Units per ml of plasma in these three animals (error bars represent standard deviation).
Safety and Toxicology Studies
We assessed the safety and toxicology of a single dose of SIG-001 following single administration into the peritoneal cavity via laparotomy in male NSG mice. Animals received either a low or high doses of SIG-001 and were observed at weeks 2, 16 and 26 for mortality, clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, clinical pathology parameters such as hematology, coagulation, and clinical chemistry, bioanalysis, gross necropsy findings, organ weights, and histopathologic examinations.
Administration of empty spheres or high- and low-dose SIG-001 spheres did not produce notable adverse effects on mortality, clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, clinical pathology, macroscopic observations, organ weights, or histopathology, and we did not observe any notable differences in cell viability or immune response between groups.

19



Clinical Development Plan
We have initiated a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical study to assess safety and efficacy of up to three dose levels of SIG-001 in patients with severe or moderate-severe Hemophilia A. At each dose level, we intend to dose an initial patient, followed by a safety review period of 28 days and assessment of FVIII activity, after which, the rest of the cohort will be enrolled or we may proceed dosing at the next dose cohort as illustrated in the chart below. 
SIG-001: Design of First-in-Human Safety and Dose Ranging Phase 1/2 Study
Two patients with severe Hemophilia A have been dosed in the study. The first patient in the study was dosed in October 2020 in the United Kingdom at the first dose level. The second patient was dosed in December 2020 in the United Kingdom at the second dose level. The administration procedure for SIG-001 was generally well tolerated. There have been no serious adverse events. We have measured FVIII activity levels at regular intervals throughout the study. At the initial dose levels for this study, tested in the first two patients, we have observed FVIII activity levels in the low-to-mid single digits.
We believe these data support continued dose escalation. As we increase dose levels, we also initiated planned manufacturing changes in the first quarter of 2021 designed to, among other things, increase cell potency and enhance cell function, and we have filed amendments to our CTA and IND with the MHRA and FDA, respectively, to incorporate these changes. We expect to dose our next patient once these amendments are cleared by the applicable agency. We also plan to submit a CTA to initiate this study in Germany. We expect to complete enrollment of our Phase 1/2 clinical study of SIG-001 in Hemophilia A prior to the end of 2021. 
Expansion into Rare Blood Disorders
Factor VII Deficiency
SIG-009 is our product candidate for Factor VII deficiency, or FVIID. For this indication, we engineered human cells to express high levels of human FVII zymogen, a non-activated FVII, as opposed to the marketed activated FVII product, coagulation FVII recombinant. We placed SIG-009 spheres in mice and observed sustained and clinically relevant levels of FVII in plasma across the 28-day study.
We have completed scientific advisory and pre-IND meetings to discuss the SIG-009 development program with both the MHRA and the FDA in the United Kingdom and United States, respectively.

20



Indication / Opportunity
While 95% to 97% of coagulopathies are due to Hemophilia A, Hemophilia B and von Willebrand disease, congenital factor VII deficiency, or FVIID, is the most common of the remaining rare coagulation disorders. FVIID constitutes approximately one third of all rare coagulation disorders, and it is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the FVII gene which result in low or undetectable plasma FVII levels. According to the National Hemophilia Foundation, or NHF, as of 2020, the incidence of FVIID is estimated to be between 1-in-300,000 and 1-in-500,000, worldwide.
FVII is a plasma vitamin K-dependent serine protease produced by the liver. The interaction of FVII with tissue factor generates the serine protease activated-FVII, or FVIIa, which is pivotal for activation of coagulation at the site of vascular injury. Severity varies amongst affected individuals and patients with severe congenital FVII deficiency, or CFVIID, can experience extensive hemarthrosis, gastrointestinal and CNS bleeds very early in life which can be lethal. Mucocutaneous bleeds and menorrhagia are the most common manifestations of the disease in patients with moderate disease (FVII levels >10-20%) and mild disease (FVII levels 20%-30%). The severe phenotype comprises approximately 10% to 15% of the patient population. Approximately 30% of CFVIID can be asymptomatic, and the remaining present with mild or moderate disease.
The introduction of prophylaxis as a therapeutic modality in CFVIID has been hampered by the fact that FVII and FVIIa have very short half-lives of less than three hours following intravenous administration.
Limitations of Current Therapies
Current standard of care for FVIID consists of on demand infusions of recombinant activated FVII, or fresh frozen plasma. Prophylactic therapy has been hampered by the very short half-life of FVII.
Our Solution—SIG-009
SIG-009 is our product candidate that contains a cell line genetically modified with a non-viral vector designed to express non-activated human factor VII, or hFVII zymogen, encapsulated within our spheres. This zymogen is the full length human protein that normally resides in the plasma at approximately 0.5 mg/L. As SIG-009 is intended to continuously produce and secrete non activated, FVII protein in a stable manner this should result in a sustained increase in FVII plasma concentration sufficient to rescue hemostasis and prevent bleeding. 
Preclinical Data
In vitro, we have been able to measure FVII levels at the protein level and most importantly, using the FVII chromogenic activity assay, have been able to evaluate protein specific activity in cells and spheres following encapsulation. In preclinical studies, hFVII zymogen produced by SIG-009 rescued clotting activity of FVII-deficient human plasma, as shown in the figure below. We observed durable FVII plasma levels in a dose-dependent manner in NSG mice, as illustrated in the figure below.

21



SIG-009: hFVII Data Demonstrated Functional Protein At Therapeutic Levels
​ ​​ ​​
(a) SIG-009 and empty spheres (SIG-000) were incubated for 16 hours and a fraction of the medium was collected and added to the human plasma obtained from FVII-deficient patients. Clotting activity was measured using FVII chromogenic activity assay. (b) SIG-009 spheres with a fixed cell number were administered intraperitoneally at 3 doses in NSG mice and plasma levels determined on days 7, 21 and 28. (c) A constant volume of spheres containing varying amounts of FVII producing cells were administered intraperitoneally in NSG mice. Blood samples were collected 14 days after administration. hFVII antigen levels in mouse plasma were measured by ELISA. N=3 per group; bars show mean +/- SEM.
Clinical Development Plan
We have initiated preclinical studies for SIG-009, and we are further evaluating clones that are designed to be high expressors of hFVII for final clone selection. Based on these preclinical activities completed to date, we plan to file an IND or CTA by mid-2022 for a Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of SIG-009 in adult female and male patients with severe FVII deficiency previously exposed to FVII-containing products. We intend to design this study to be an open-label, dose escalation trial.
Hemophilia B
Factor IX circulates as a single chain inactive form. Normal circulating factor IX plasma concentration is around 5000 ng/ml.
The severity classification for patients with Hemophilia B is the same as is used for classification of patients with Hemophilia A. Currently there are several marketed Hemophilia B factor products and several ongoing clinical studies investigating gene therapy-based approaches.
SIG-003 is our product candidate for Factor IX deficiency, or FIXD. SIG-003 contains cells genetically modified with a non-viral vector to express human factor IX, or hFIX, with the Padua mutation known to increase activity, encapsulated within our spheres. We have completed an innovation office meeting with the MHRA regarding this program.

22



Lysosomal Diseases
Lysosomal diseases are a large group of nearly 50 diseases affecting lysosomal enzyme function and resulting in the accumulation of substrates within cells leading to progressive impairment of their function. The age of manifestation and speed of progression varies depending on the underlying disorder and amount of residual lysosomal enzyme activity. Lysosomal diseases may affect different organ systems, including the skeleton, brain, skin and soft tissues, joints, heart, and CNS and symptoms are chronically progressive. At present, enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT and substrate reduction therapy are available treatment options for patients with certain types of lysosomal diseases.
Lysosomal diseases such as Fabry disease, Gaucher disease and several mucopolysaccharidoses, or MPS, are primarily managed by frequent, multi-hour infusions with ERTs that seek to exogenously replace the dysfunctional enzyme. However, given the characteristics of most ERTs, they require frequent dosing. These existing therapies have made a positive impact on these patients, but, as the dosing and frequency have not been optimized, the dosing does not resemble physiological conditions and diseases may progress or be ineffectively managed. Further, the frequent, periodic and life-long dosing schedule required for ERTs results in significant costs for the healthcare system and is burdensome for the patient. While biopharmaceutical companies are considering gene therapies for the treatment for several diseases caused by single genetic defects, this approach has historically exhibited unpredictable dose response and potential long-term safety concerns, including genotoxicity.
We believe our SLTx therapies can leverage the well understood mechanism of ERTs by using engineered cells to express functional enzyme or other protein that more closely resemble normal physiology in a continuous manner. We believe that a single dose of our SLTx therapies may provide meaningful longer-term benefit to these patients and functionally cure these diseases while also providing significant health economic advantages.
In addition, we believe the modularity of our SLTx platform can be applied across a range of lysosomal storage diseases. Our initial product candidates in lysosomal diseases include product candidates for treating MPS-1, MPS-2 and Fabry. In preclinical studies relating to these disorders, we have designed cells to produce high levels of the biochemically active enzymes that are missing or deficient in afflicted patients. We believe sustained substrate reduction can be achieved by the long-term production of these enzyme, which are transported to the clinically relevant tissues. We have completed pre-IND and scientific advice meetings to discuss our MPS-1 and Fabry programs with the FDA and the MHRA, which has informed our CMC, preclinical and clinical activities for these programs. Our ability to leverage the modularity of our SLTx platform, including manufacturing processes, across our lysosomal disease programs is expected to result in a streamlined path for these programs to the clinic.
MPS-1
SIG-005 is our product candidate that contains a cell line genetically modified with a non-viral vector designed to express human a-L-iduronidase, or IDUA, encapsulated within our spheres. SIG-005 is being developed for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS-1 to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease. We were granted Orphan Drug designation for SIG-005 for the treatment of MPS-1 by the FDA in December 2020. We have completed pre-IND and scientific advisory meetings with both FDA and MHRA.
Indication / Opportunity
MPS-1 is a deficiency in an intracellular enzyme, IDUA, which is required for the lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate, or HS, and dermatan sulfate, or DS. The build-up of glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs, interferes with the normal function of proteins in the lysosome, eventually leading to disruption of cell function. The clinical phenotype of MPS-1 is characterized by progressive multi-systemic involvement affecting the brain, eye, ear, upper and lower airways, liver, spleen, heart, bone, cartilage, and joints. Severity of MPS-1 has traditionally been classified into three MPS-1 syndromes, Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome, and Scheie syndrome, graded severe to less severe respectively. Most severe cases present with multisystem developmental abnormalities that appear early in life and if left untreated, result in pre-teen fatality. The approximate incidence of MPS-1 is 1 in 100,000 live births. ERT sales for MPS-1 are approximately $250 million annually, which represents treatment of approximately 30%-40% of the patient population.

23



Limitations of current therapies
Current standard of care for MPS-1 includes ERT and allogeneic HSCT. ERT requires life-long weekly administration and can be hampered by a short enzyme half-life and the development of anti-drug antibodies limiting their effectiveness. Currently, ERT is not used in all MPS-1 patients due to limited efficacy in patients with a more severe form of the disease and the high cost of treatment. Allogeneic HSCT availability is limited to countries with technologically advanced healthcare systems; outside these areas patients with severe disease are only treated with ERT. HSCT depends on the availability of matched donors and can result in rejections, graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD, serious infections and even mortality. Even with some available therapies, MPS-1 remains incurable with long-term complications and high patient burden.
Our Solution—SIG-005
We believe that sustained therapeutic effect could be achieved by administration of IDUA-secreting allogeneic cells shielded within our spheres, thus avoiding an immune response. SIG-005 is our product candidate for MPS-1 and is ultimately designed to provide continuous and prolonged release of functional enzyme at levels sufficient to produce clinical benefits and alleviate progression of the downstream aspects of the disease. We expect that the uptake of secreted human IDUA by affected tissues, which relies on the mannose 6-phosphate receptor, or M6P receptor, will lead to increased catabolism of GAGs hence preventing their buildup in the lysosomes of various tissues and organs. We believe that sustained, consistent plasma IDUA levels may also facilitate more efficient enzyme uptake by tissues with lower M6P receptor expression due to the constant availability of the enzyme for uptake, in contrast to the peak-trough pattern of plasma enzyme levels observed in the current ERT treatment regimen. A major clinical manifestation in MPS-1 disease is the accumulation of GAGs in bones and surrounding tissues which leads to progressive skeletal deformities. With early treatment, we believe the sustained levels of enzyme produced by SIG-005 may further address musculoskeletal defects associated with MPS-1.
Preclinical Data
We administered various doses of SIG-005 into the peritoneal cavity of MPS 1-H mice, which display similar biochemical and clinical features as the severe phenotype of the human disease, Hurler Syndrome. We tested plasma for a trisaccharide and total GAG levels at 5, 10 and 14 days post-administration. Additionally, total GAG analysis was performed in liver, spleen and kidney post-termination at 10 days. As illustrated in the figure below, we observed a statistically significant GAG reduction in both plasma at 10 and 14 days and tissues at 10 days of more than 90%. These data showed uptake of the enzyme produced by SIG-005 into relevant tissues, leading to significant GAG reduction, at all doses.

SIG-005 Produces hIDUA in Dose-Responsive Manner, Reduces GAG (Heparin Sulfate)
Accumulation in MPS 1-H Mice
​ ​​ ​​
14-day study: SIG-005 produces hIDUA in a dose-dependent manner. Even the lowest dose of SIG-005 is able to reduce GAG's accumulation across relevant tissues (liver, kidney and spleen) of MPS 1-H Mice N= 4 in each dose cohort. Control: MPS 1-H Mice N=4.
We have also administered various doses of SIG-005 into the peritoneal cavity of NSG mice. As depicted in the figures below, hIDUA activity was maintained in vitro and in vivo in NSG mice until study end, three months following single administration of SIG-005.

25



In Vivo SIG-005 Activity in NSG Mice 3 Months Post-Administration
​ ​​ ​​
3-month study in NSG mice: Spheres producing SIG-005 were placed in the intraperitoneal space and assessed for hIDUA activity in vitro at pre-implantation and at 90-days, as well as in explanted spheres taken from NSG mice 90-days after dosing. hIDUA activity was also evaluated in vivo in plasma and liver tissues after 90 days of implantation. NSG immune deficient mice were used for this study so that the human protein could be followed for longer time points without concern for immune response to the human protein. For the day 90 cohort, N=6 animals; sham N=2. P values, unpaired t-test vs sham. 
In in vivo MPS-1 mouse models, we have observed phenotypic correction in bone physiology after five months of treatment with SIG-005. This in vivo data demonstrated statistically significant reduction in heparin sulfate, HS, in a dose-dependent fashion across multiple tissues including liver, kidney, lungs and heart. A reduction in bone diameters (trabecular and cortical bone) and in bone density was also observed. We believe the continuous secretion of hIDUA has the potential to reduce substrate in difficult-to-treat tissues, such as the bone, which are unlikely to be modified with current therapies.
Reduction of HS in Tissues of MPS-1 Mice 5 months after SIG-005
​ ​​ ​​
5-month study in MPS 1-H mice: SIG-005 spheres producing hIDUA were placed in the intraperitoneal space at various doses. hIDUA activity and GAGs were measured in liver. Alcian blue staining of GAG (heparan sulfate) was also performed in multiple tissues. Bone diameters were measured by microCT imaging. Sustained hIDUA activity in liver, GAG reduction in major organs and phenotypic changes in the bone were observed.

Clinical Development Plan
We have selected a clone for SIG-005 that was used to create an MCB and working cell bank, or WCB. In addition, we have initiated IND-enabling studies and GMP manufacturing processes. Based on these preclinical activities completed to date, we plan to file an IND and/or CTA in the first half of 2021 for a Phase 1/2 open label, dose escalation clinical trial. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 trial to assess the efficacy of SIG-005 in patients with MPS-1 in the second half of 2021.
Fabry Disease
SIG-007 is being developed for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease. SIG-007 cells are genetically modified with a non-viral vector designed to express human alpha-galactosidase A, or AGAL, and encapsulated within our alginate spheres. We were granted Orphan Drug designation for SIG-007 for the treatment of Fabry disease by the FDA in March 2021. We have completed pre-IND and scientific advisory meetings with both FDA and MHRA.
Indication/Opportunity
Fabry disease is a X-linked lysosomal disease caused by the deficiency of AGAL and accumulation of substrates including globotriaosylceramide, or Gb3, in cells. As a result, Fabry leads to progressive, life-threatening, multi-organ pathology, including kidney failure, gastrointestinal symptoms, strokes, and heart disease at a young age. Approximately 4,000 to 5,000 patients with Fabry disease are known in the United States, based on emerging newborn screening data, however many more undiagnosed patients likely exist. The current worldwide market for Fabry disease therapy is approximately $1.5 billion. The market is growing rapidly driven by increases in both diagnosis and treatment. Fabry remains incurable with long-term complications and high patient burden. The current clinical pipeline includes several approaches such as extended half-life ERT, substrate reduction, and gene therapy.
Limitations of Current Therapies
Current standard of care includes ERT, conventional medical treatment and adjunctive therapies, with more recently approved chaperone therapy. There are several approved ERT therapies for the treatment of Fabry disease, including agalsidase beta and agalsidase alpha. Both of those therapies are versions of AGAL ERTs that are administered intravenously, often requiring long infusion times and can lead to undesired infusion-associated reactions. These enzymes are effective at decreasing substrate accumulation in some tissues and slowing disease progression, however patients that have been on ERTs for ten years still have renal function decline at a rate greater than normal healthy individuals. In addition to ERTs, a small molecule chaperone therapy has been approved in the United States and Europe for treatment of a limited subset of patients.

27



Our Solution—SIG-007
We believe that sustained therapeutic effect could be achieved by administration of AGAL-secreting allogeneic cells shielded within our spheres. SIG-007 is our product candidate for Fabry and is designed to provide continuous and prolonged release of functional enzyme at levels sufficient to produce clinical benefits and alleviate progression of the downstream aspects of the disease. Similar to other lysosomal enzymes, we expect AGAL produced by SIG-007 spheres to be taken up by tissues via M6P receptors.
Preclinical data
We administered different doses of SIG-007, into the intraperitoneal space of the Fabry mice. As depicted in the figures below, 14 days post-administration, we observed significant human AGAL levels in mouse plasma, liver and kidney. Additionally, following the administration of SIG-007 in Fabry mice at different dose levels, we detected statistically significant reduction of Gb3 in liver, spleen and plasma in up to 90% at highest dose of SIG-007 compared to the control Fabry mice (data not shown). We also observed statistically significant reduction in lyso-Gb3 biomarker across all relevant tissues. We believe, these data confirm that SIG-007 is a potential alternative to established ERT, and has the potential to fundamentally change the approach to treating serious chronic diseases and, in doings so, transform the care for patients living with the burden of their disease.

SIG-007 Reduced Lyso-GB3 Accumulation Across Multiple Relevant Tissues in Fabry Mice
​ ​​ ​​
14-day study in Fabry mice: SIG-007 spheres producing hIDUA were placed in the intraperitoneal space at various doses. AGAL enzyme activity and the accumulation of Gb3 and lyso-GB3 were measured in various tissues. SIG-007 spheres produced sustained levels of active hGLA in vivo. A dose responsive reduction in Gb3 (data not shown) and in lyso-Gb3 accumulation was observed in plasma, urine and across multiple tissues evaluated (liver, spleen, kidney and heart). 
Clinical Development Plan
We have selected a clone for SIG-007 that is being used to create an MCB. In addition, we have initiated IND-enabling studies and GMP manufacturing processes as this program proceeds toward an IND filing.
MPS-2
SIG-018 is a product candidate containing a cell line genetically modified with a non-viral vector to express human iduronate-2-sulfatase, or IDS, encapsulated within two-layer modified alginate spheres. SIG-018 is being developed for patients with a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme IDS, which is the enzyme responsible for the lysosomal clearance of HS and DS. Lack of this enzyme results in a progressive, multisystem disorder affecting approximately one in 100,000 to one in 170,000 male births.
In preclinical studies, we administered different doses of SIG-018 into the intraperitoneal space of MPS-2 mice for up to 4-weeks. Sustained hIDS activity in plasma was observed in a 21-day study. Significant reduction of HS in multiple tissues at 1 week and 4 weeks post administration was measured in separate studies. Specifically, we detected an early and statistically significant reduction of heparin sulfate across all MPS-2 mouse tissues, including the liver, spleen, heart and kidney, even at the lowest dose levels of SIG-018 compared to untreated controls, as shown in the figure below. We believe, these data confirm that SIG-018 is a potential alternative to established ERT.

29



SIG-018 Dose Response Study in MPS-2 Mice 1 Week After Treatment
​
​ ​​ ​​
MPS-2 mice studies: SIG-018 spheres producing hIDS were placed in the intraperitoneal space at various doses. hIDS enzyme activity was evaluated up to 21 days in one study. SIG-018 spheres produced sustained levels of active hIDS in plasma (data not shown). Accumulation of HS was measured in various tissues at one and four weeks in separate studies. A dose responsive reduction in HS was observed as early as one week post-SIG-018 administration.
MPS-6
SIG-020 is a product candidate containing a cell line genetically modified with a non-viral vector to co-express human arylsulfatase B, or ARSB and enzymes affecting post-translation modifications, encapsulated within two-layer modified alginate spheres. SIG-020 is being developed for patients with a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme ARSB, which is the enzyme responsible for the lysosomal clearance of dermatan sulfate. Lack of this enzyme results in a progressive, multisystem condition affecting approximately one in 250,000 to one in 600,000 newborns.
In preclinical studies, we administered different doses of SIG-020 into the intraperitoneal space of MPS VI mice. As depicted in the figure below, we observed reduction of substrate levels (dermatan sulfate) across all MPS VI mouse tissues, including the liver, kidney and lungs, as compared to untreated controls on Day 7 post-administration.

Substrate Reduction in MPS-6 Mouse Tissues
​ ​​ ​​
7-day study in MPS VI mice: SIG-020 spheres co-expressing hARSB and enzymes affecting post-translation modification were placed in the intraperitoneal space at a single dose. Significant reduction in accumulation of substrate (dermatan sulfate) were measured in various tissues, including liver, kidney and lung seven days post-administration. 
Endocrine and other Chronic Disorders
Type 1 Diabetes
SIG-002 is an islet cell replacement therapy product candidate for treatment of T1D. In T1D, the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells within the endocrine islets of the pancreas. Insulin deficiency results in dysregulation of glucose metabolism. In April 2018, we partnered with Lilly to develop cell therapies for the treatment of T1D, including SIG-002.
Indication / opportunity
T1D is an autoimmune and chronic disease that results from the destruction of pancreatic beta cells. T1D patients are unable to produce sufficient levels of insulin and effectively modulate glucose levels and require subcutaneous insulin injections to maintain blood glucose levels within an appropriate range. Despite recent advances resulting in a range of therapeutic options with exogenous insulin and glucose monitoring, a significant unmet clinical need remains for T1D patients. A large majority of adults and adolescents with T1D do not meet HbA1c management goals, and substantial rates of life-threatening severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis persist, as recently reported by the T1D Exchange registry. Vascular damage from chronic elevated blood glucose levels can result in various complications including neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease. Some T1D patients, usually described as having brittle diabetes have chronic severe metabolic instability despite intensive insulin therapy; this includes patients with a history of multiple episodes of severe hypoglycemic events, or SHEs, often with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, or IAH.
Recent estimates indicate that worldwide and in the United States approximately 460 million and 30 million adults (20-79 years), respectively, have diabetes, of which about 10% are T1D. T1D has approximately 1.2 million identified patients in the United States and is anticipated to grow at approximately 3% per year. Further, approximately 1.1 million children and adolescents younger than 20 years are estimated to have T1D globally. Diabetes prevalence is projected to continue increasing in the next few decades.
Even with advances in blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery technologies, a preferred approach is to provide a functional cure; something to replace the pancreas. While fluctuations in blood glucose levels were reduced, immunosuppression was needed in order to preserve effectiveness of the treatment. There are approximately 1,000 

31



pancreatic transplants annually in the US. Islet cell transplantation is considered experimental and is not currently FDA-approved or explicitly reimbursed. Approximately 1,000 procedures were performed between 1999 and 2013.
Limitations of Current Therapies
T1D patients require subcutaneous insulin injections to maintain blood glucose levels within appropriate range. Despite recent advances in a range of therapeutic options with exogenous insulin and glucose monitoring, a significant unmet clinical need remains for people with T1D. A large majority of adults and adolescents with T1D do not meet HbA1c management goals, and substantial rates of life-threatening severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis persist, as recently reported by the T1D Exchange Registry. High risk T1D patients have chronic severe metabolic instability despite intensive insulin therapy; this includes patients with a history of multiple episodes of SHEs, often with IAH.
High risk T1D patients are candidates to receive cadaveric allogeneic pancreatic islet cell products or pancreatic transplants. Allogeneic islets are typically transplanted into the portal vein along with immunosuppression regimen to prevent allograft rejection. A Phase 3 clinical trial in subjects with intractable IAH and SHEs demonstrated that allogeneic islet transplantation provided glycemic control, restoration of hypoglycemia awareness, and protection from SHEs. 42% of subjects achieved insulin independence for at least two years. Adverse safety events reported were related to the infusion procedure and immunosuppression, including bleeding and decreased renal function. A shortage of donor cadaveric islets and the need for chronic immunosuppression preclude wider use of cadaveric islet transplantation therapy for T1D.
Our Solution—SIG-002
SIG-002 comprises an allogeneic endocrine cell population, which we prepared by differentiating induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, using a proprietary protocol designed to produce cells that function similarly to human islets with glucose-responsive insulin secreting cells. The differentiated cells are encapsulated within our spheres to prevent immune rejection of the cells, as illustrated as the figure below. We are developing SIG-002 under our partnership with Lilly and we are leading the execution of all research and development until the first IND filing.

The potential function of SIG-002 is the regulation of blood glucose homeostasis through glucose-responsive secretion of insulin from the alginate spheres, or sense and respond. SIG-002 is designed to provide durable insulin secretion.
For SIG-002 we have acquired human iPSC lines and developed a protocol for directed differentiation to produce pancreatic islet cells in vitro. These allogeneic human islet cells are encapsulated in our spheres and then placed in vivo.
SIG-002 is in development for treatment of adults and children with T1D who have difficulty in regulating their blood glucose levels using available insulin therapies. SIG-002 is designed to improve glycemic control, thereby reducing complications of T1D and improving quality of life outcomes for patients.

32



Foundational Data
Early experimental data demonstrated that even with xenogeneic cells from different species, rat islets, that our Afibromer technology shielded cells which remained alive and functional for long periods of time, thereby normalizing glucose control in streptozotocin diabetic mice.
In this study, MIT implanted 0.5 ml of one-layered spheres containing islets in the peritoneal cavity of healthy mice, treated with streptozotocin, or STZ, to invoke diabetes. Mice were then tested for blood glucose levels every three days for 330 days until the mice were sacrificed. This experiment was repeated three different times with similar results each time with cohorts of five mice, consistently achieving blood glucose measures under 200mg/dL, normal blood glucose level for mice. In addition, human islets differentiated from embryonic stem cells were placed into STZ mice and, in this study, normal blood glucose levels were maintained in mice for the duration of the study.

​ ​​ ​​
Rat donor islets in STZ mice.
Preclinical data
We plan to have a robust preclinical program for SIG-002, including studies designed to support the biocompatibility of the alginates, as well as to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product candidate. These studies are designed to address the following preclinical objectives:

· | Evaluation of long-term efficacy of the intended clinical product candidate in a murine model of diabetes with assessment of multiple doses; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Safety assessment of intended clinical product candidate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

In addition to our preclinical studies, we are putting significant effort on the optimization of the manufacturing process for islets. Unlike the cells in our other product candidates, islets are in aggregate form rather than individual cells. We believe these efforts are important to create a standard manufactured sphere with a uniform number of islets/sphere.

33



Encapsulated SC-islets cells
Clinical Development Plan
We are currently working through the IND-enabling preclinical studies described above in collaboration with Lilly. Lilly is responsible for the clinical development of SIG-002, including the clinical development plan.
Immune-mediated diseases
We believe that our SLTx platform has the potential to provide a functional cure to patients with immune-mediated diseases by restoring immune homeostasis and potentially inducing functional tolerance. Our SLTx platform is particularly suitable for short half-life cytokines and other immunomodulators that require frequent administrations, thus limiting their development as therapeutics even though preclinical work has demonstrated strong scientific reasoning that they could be effective. In addition, restoring homeostatic balance in the immune system will likely require targeting multiple pathways, for which our SLTx platform may be well-suited. 
We are currently exploring targets and indications most suitable to benefit from our platform technology. Preclinical data has shown that SLTx can overcome pharmacokinetic barriers hampering the therapeutic use of certain treatments, potentially providing treatments for a number of diseases with high unmet need. As proof of concept, we have shown that we can produce a wide variety of these important modulators. For example, in a murine model of autoimmune hepatitis, we have demonstrated sustained production of IL-10 in the plasma of the animals along with a concomitant alteration of the monocyte compartment towards a tolerogenic phenotype as measured by CD206 expression. The delivery of IL-10 was observed to reduce hepatic cell death as determined by histology and plasma alanine transaminase, or ALT, levels, a marker of liver damage.


34



Wet AMD
We evaluated the potential to administer our product candidates at relevant concentrations locally, as well as, the potential of our cell platform to manufacture therapeutic antibodies. We believe that localized implantation may deliver concentrated levels of therapeutic locally, and thereby offer for increased efficacy and lower systemic exposure, which could be beneficial for the treatment of certain diseases, such as wet age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. We have explored intravitreal injection in a rabbit model of wet AMD producing an approved target, anti-VEGF.
Manufacturing Process
Significant effort and resources have been spent over the last three years to create a standardized, efficient, flexible, and consistent manufacturing platform. We use a traditional allogeneic cell-based manufacturing process for our platform cell line, akin to biologics manufacturing. This process is identical for all of our products, except for SIG-002, and follows the typical cadence of creation of a clonal master cell bank, followed by a working cell bank, and, finally, expansion of a working cell bank vial for each manufacturing run. The hydrogel and Afibromer alginate are sourced and manufactured in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, by our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and are used for all of our programs. We believe the modularity of our platform approach allows us to reduce the time from discovery to IND since the manufacturing know-how and preclinical testing is the same from therapy to therapy. The cost of goods for our therapeutic product candidate, if approved, is expected to be similar to monoclonal antibodies, which is significantly lower than the cost of existing cell or gene therapies.
Consistent with other cell therapies, we have designed our manufacturing process to provide the flexibility to refine our product candidates to optimize the therapeutic dose for patients. We believe these refinements could include increasing or decreasing the number of spheres manufactured and placed into the patient as well as the number of cells placed into each sphere. In addition, we continue to explore opportunities to improve cell potency through process development changes designed to enhance cell function. For example, by changing our wash and storage buffer, we have seen an increase in cell potency over the prior buffer. We will continue to explore these types of enhancements and will implement them when we believe appropriate. Certain of these changes would require an amendment to an IND, CTA or other regulatory filing before being implemented in a particular clinical trial.

35



The encapsulation process to generate final drug product is unique and proprietary to the SLTx platform and the critical step in creating our product candidates. We manufacture the spheres using a dual lumen needle. The cells with their matrix are in the inner lumen, while the Afibromer alginate is in the outer lumen. A droplet is then emitted from the needle, drops into a crosslinking solution where the sphere is permanently crosslinked. The dual layer sphere has the cells in the inner compartment while the small molecule biomaterial is in the outer layer which has contact with the body.

Currently we use a proprietary semiautomated process for encapsulation which provides appropriate scale production runs to supply our Phase 1/2 clinical programs. The final product is shipped at room temperature. We are developing a fully automated encapsulation system for Phase 3 and potential commercial scale, which is expected to include cryopreserved final drug product. We believe these manufacturing innovations and know-how will enable us to have one of the only allogeneic cell therapies with cost of goods similar to biologics.

36



Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the cell and gene therapy field, are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge in the field of cell and gene therapy and manufacturing provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
There are numerous companies that are selling or developing genetic medicines that may directly compete with our SLTx product candidates. These companies include Sanofi, Takeda, BioMarin, Novo Nordisk, Sangamo Inc., or Sangamo, Spark, Inc., or Spark, Ultragenyx, Pfizer, Bayer, UniQure, Inc., or UniQure, CSL Behring, Freeline Therapeutics Holdings plc, or Freeline, and Roche.
For our specific Hemophilia A, FVIID and lysosomal disease therapy product candidates, the main competitors include:

· | Hemophilia A: Current manufacturers of FVIII replacement therapies include Takeda, Sanofi, CSL Behring and Bayer. With respect to emerging therapies, there are three primary competitors: (i) BioMarin announced in November 2019 that it submitted an MAA filing with the EMA for its ValRox product candidate and announced in December 2019 that it submitted a BLA to the FDA for the same product candidate; (ii) Roche (Spark Therapeutics) is progressing towards a Phase 3 clinical trial with its SPK-8011 product and is also starting a program for patients with Hemophilia A and inhibitors; and (iii) Sangamo is also finalizing its Phase 1/2 dose-escalating clinical trial for the treatment of Hemophilia A. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Factor VII Deficiency: Currently, we are not aware of any competitor in development for prophylaxis treatment for Factor VII Deficiency. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | MPS-1: Besides existing marketed products such as laronidase (marketed by Sanofi), we believe that there are several competitors in various stages of development using a variety of technologies such as gene editing technology (CRISPR Therapeutics and Sangamo), AAV-based gene therapy (Amicus Therapeutics and Regenxbio, Inc), and next generations enzyme replacement therapies (Armagen/JCR Pharmaceuticals). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fabry diseases: Currently, we believe our only competitor in the clinic is AvroBio, which is conducting a Phase 1 and a Phase 2 clinical trials using an ex vivo lentiviral platform for their Fabry disease program. Sangamo has also disclosed that it is evaluating its ST-920 product candidate in adults with classic Fabry disease in a Phase 1/2 open-label, dose-ascending clinical trial, and that the FDA has granted orphan drug 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

37



designation to this product candidate. Freeline Therapeutics has disclosed that they plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 trial in the near term to evaluate FTL190 in patients with Fabry Disease.
Many of our competitors, either independently or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we are in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than products we may develop. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of the entry of our products. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of other drugs. The key competitive factors affecting the successful of all any products we may develop are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and availability of reimbursement.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our platform technology, programs and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, exclusively licensing and filing United States, or the U.S., and certain foreign patent applications related to our platform technology, product candidates and improvements that are important to the development of our business, where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and confidential information to develop and maintain our proprietary position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Our in-licensed patents and patent applications cover various aspects of our SLTx platform, including chemically-modified alginates, methods of encapsulation and sphere compositions. We also have filed patent applications directed to the composition, configuration and manufacturing of our spheres, as well as the specific therapeutic protein expression construct and/or engineered cell line used in each of our product candidates. We intend to pursue, when possible, additional patent protection, including composition of matter, method of use and process claims, directed to future product candidates and improvements to our SLTx platform, including manufacturing of individual sphere components and sphere preparations.
Notwithstanding these efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have licensed or filed or may license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we have licensed or patents that may be licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. Moreover, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent's term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. Also, the term of a U.S. patent relating to an approved drug product may be extended pursuant to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984; however, an extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug or a method for using it may be extended.
As of December 31, 2020, we owned three pending U.S. provisional patent applications, eight pending PCT patent applications and 59 other pending patent applications, including six pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, five pending European patent applications and 48 other related patent applications in jurisdictions outside the United States and Europe. These patent applications relate to all elements of the SLTx platform and our product candidates, including the composition, configuration and manufacturing of our spheres and human cells engineered with non-viral expression vectors that express therapeutic proteins. Certain of these patent applications cover the specific engineered cells in our lead product candidates and other disease areas. If issued as U.S. patents, and if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, the U.S. patent applications would be expected to expire between 2037 and 2041, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
Aspects of our SLTx platform technology are covered by patents and patent applications licensed from MIT on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. The exclusively licensed MIT portfolio includes several patent families that cover our Afibromer matrix and the dual-layer configuration used in our spheres. As of December 31, 2020, our exclusively licensed MIT portfolio related to our SLTx platform consisted of: 14 U.S. patents; one European patent and related validations; 15 patents in jurisdictions outside the United States and Europe and 37 pending patent applications, including nine pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications; and seven pending European patent applications. The patents and patent applications outside of the United States and Europe are held primarily in Australia, Canada and Japan, although some of our in-licensed patent families were filed in a larger number of countries. As of December 31, 2021, our non-exclusively licensed MIT portfolio related to our SLTx platform consisted of one U.S. patent and one pending U.S. non-provisional application. The claims from our in-licensed portfolio include claims to compositions of matter, methods of use and certain processes. Our current in-licensed U.S. patents, if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, are expected to expire between 2032 and 2037, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. If issued as U.S. patents, and if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, the U.S. patent applications would be expected to expire between 2032 and 2038, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
License and Collaboration Agreements
Exclusive Patent License Agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
In February 2016, we entered into a license agreement with MIT, and, in February 2017, August 2018 and November 2019 we entered into amendments to such license agreement, or together with all amendments, the MIT License, pursuant to which we received an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under certain patent rights owned or controlled by MIT to develop, make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, lease, import and export products, and to develop, perform, practice, sell and offer to sell processes, in the field of the diagnosis, treatment and/or prevention of disease or other conditions in humans and animals. We also received an option to add certain improvements arising from research performed in certain MIT laboratories to the license.
Under the MIT License, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products or licensed processes and to introduce such products or processes into the commercial market, making them reasonably available to the public. There are also certain developments, spending and fundraising milestones that we are required to meet, as well as timelines for the completion thereof.

MIT and Boston Children's Hospital retain the right on behalf of themselves and other non-profit research institutions to practice under the licensed patent rights for non-profit research, teaching and educational purposes, including sponsored research and collaborations. The U.S. government also retains a non-exclusive license to practice any government funded invention claimed in any licensed patent. The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation retains the right to use and practice certain patent rights for non-commercial research purposes related to the diagnosis, cure, treatment and/or prevention of T1D and its complications.
Although the licenses granted to us under the MIT License are exclusive, MIT may grant a license to a third party under the licensed patents to develop and commercialize a product or process in the field under limited circumstances. If a third party inquires with MIT or us for such a license, the party receiving the inquiry will obtain a proposal summary from such third party and notify the other party of such proposal. If we do not (i) reasonably demonstrate that (1) the proposed product would be directly competitive with a licensed product or process that we, our affiliates or sublicensees are diligently developing, (2) we, our affiliates or sublicensees have already begun a project for and are diligently researching, developing or commercializing the proposed product, or (3) based on competent evidence, the third party does not have adequate financial or scientific resources or a reasonable strategy to develop and commercialize such proposed product, (ii) provide MIT with a business plan with mutually acceptable, reasonable diligence milestones for the commercial development of the proposed product or (iii) negotiate in good faith with such third party and enter into a sublicense agreement on commercially reasonable terms, MIT may grant a license to the third party and our license under the patent rights for the proposed product will terminate.
We are permitted to sublicense our rights under the MIT License through multiple tiers, provided that any such sublicense is on terms that are sufficient to permit us to comply with the MIT License. However, if we become a non-exclusive licensee for any licensed patent in any country pursuant to our discontinuation of support for such licensed patent in such country or an amendment to this agreement, we will no longer have the right to grant sublicenses under such patent right in such country.
In exchange for the licenses grant to us under the MIT License, we issued MIT 333,333 shares of common stock, paid MIT a license issue fee of $50,000 and reimbursed MIT $10,000 for past patent costs. We paid MIT an additional $15,000 improvement fee and reimbursement for past patent costs in connection with each of the 2018 and 2019 amendments to the MIT License. Pursuant to the MIT License, MIT also has the right to participate in future private equity offerings by us. We are required to pay MIT annual license maintenance fees ranging from low-to-mid five figures to low-to-mid six figures, depending on the particular calendar year. MIT is entitled to receive potential clinical, regulatory and sales milestones in the low-to-mid eight figure range.
MIT is entitled to receive low single digit royalties on our net sales of licensed products until, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, the expiration of the last valid claim within the patent rights covering such licensed product in such country. We are entitled to certain offsets on these royalties if we or an affiliate must pay royalties to one or more third parties in order to obtain a license necessary to make, use or sell licensed products. Our royalty payments will increase if we or our affiliates bring a patent challenge and MIT does not exercise its termination right. If we sublicense our rights to develop or commercialize a licensed product or process under the MIT License to a third party and we receive non-royalty sublicense income, then MIT is entitled to a percentage of such consideration, ranging between 10% and 20% depending on the date in which such sublicense agreement is executed and the stage of development of our licensed products at such time.
Unless earlier terminated, the MIT License will remain in effect until the expiration or abandonment of all valid claims within the patent rights. We may terminate the MIT License at our convenience following written notice to MIT. MIT may terminate the MIT License if (i) we cease to carry on our business related to the MIT License or become insolvent, (ii) we fail to make payments or commit a material breach of our diligence or other obligations under the MIT License following written notice, or (iii) we bring a patent challenge or one of our sublicensees brings a patent challenge and we fail to terminate such sublicense. Upon termination by MIT in regards to certain licensed patents related to T1D for our failure to fulfill our related diligence obligations, and at MIT's request, we will grant MIT a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under the other licensed patents solely to the extent necessary to develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, lease, import and export products covered by such terminated patents in the field of diagnosis, treatment and/or prevention of T1D in humans and animals.

Eli Lilly Strategic Research and Development Partnership
In April 2018, we entered into a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Lilly for the development and commercialization of SLTx product candidates for the treatment of T1D. We formed a strategic partnership with Lilly because they are a leader in the field of diabetes and because of their industry expertise and capabilities in diabetes treatment and their experience developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products. Under this agreement, we granted Lilly an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, including the right to grant sublicenses to certain know-how and patent rights related to our SLTx technology, including patent rights licensed to us pursuant to the MIT License, to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products comprising encapsulated islet cells, which we believe have potential use for the treatment of T1D. Lilly has granted to us a non-exclusive, royalty free license, with the right to sublicense, to use and practice certain intellectual property to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize products that do not contain islet cells, and other rights.
We are responsible for preclinical development of a product candidate, and completion of the studies and other criteria required for filing the first IND with respect to such product candidate. Lilly is then responsible for filing the first IND for a product candidate developed pursuant to the partnership and all subsequent clinical development and commercialization. Lilly is also responsible for all research, development and commercialization with respect to any subsequent product candidate. As of August 2020, the most advanced product candidate in this partnership is in the pre-IND stage.
We are responsible for our own costs and expenses associated with research and development ahead of the first IND filing for a product candidate developed pursuant to the partnership. Lilly is responsible for its own costs in the development, commercialization and manufacture of the product candidates, as well as research and development costs for the first developed product candidate, above $47.5 million.
We and Lilly agreed to evaluate a third-party cell line provider to provide differentiated human pancreatic islet cells, for use in the product candidates developed pursuant to the partnership. Prior to the filings of the first IND we are responsible for all preclinical supply of the product candidates. Following submission of the first IND, we will be responsible for the supply of investigational product for Phase 1 clinical trials and, following completion of such trials, we will continue to be responsible for supplying to Lilly encapsulation material used in each product candidate for clinical and commercial use.
We received a $62.5 million upfront payment from Lilly under this agreement. If our first product candidate developed pursuant to the partnership is successfully developed and commercialized, we are entitled to receive up to $165.0 million in regulatory milestones and $250.0 million in sales-based milestones and tiered (from mid-single-to-low-double digit) sales-based royalties on net sales of such product. In connection with the 2018 Lilly Agreement, we issued to Lilly 3,500,000 shares of our Series A-3 convertible preferred stock for a purchase price of approximately $13.1 million. In 2019, Lilly purchased 2,000,000 shares of our Series B convertible preferred stock for a purchase price of approximately $12.0 million. The Series A-3 and Series B convertible preferred stock converted into common stock in connection with our initial public offering.
Unless earlier terminated, this agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last royalty term for a product under the agreement in all countries. The royalty term means, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, the period commencing upon the first commercial sale of a product and ending upon the later to occur of: (i) the later of expiration of the last Sigilon patent right that covers the composition of matter, regulatory-approved method of use, or the encapsulation method of a product candidate developed pursuant to the partnership; (ii) 10 years from the date of first commercial sale of such product in such country; or (iii) expiration of any data exclusivity period in such country. Upon the expiration of each royalty term for each product on a country-by-country basis, Lilly's exclusive license will be retained as a fully paid-up, irrevocable and perpetual, exclusive, license with respect to such product in such country. Lilly may terminate this agreement upon prior written notice to us. Each party may terminate this agreement in its entirety upon bankruptcy or similar proceedings of the other party or upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party.

Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping, reimbursement, advertising, promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting and import and export, pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products, including biological products such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process or post-approval may subject an applicant for marketing approval to delays in development or approval, as well as administrative and judicial sanctions.
License and Regulation of Biologics in the United States
In the United States, our candidate products are regulated by the FDA as biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the implementing regulations of the FDA and other federal, state and local statutes and regulations.
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps:

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency, and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or GCP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials, requesting marketing of the biological product for one or more proposed indications, including submission of detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product and proposed labelling;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the application for review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current cGMP requirements; to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity; and, if applicable, the FDA's current good tissue practice, or cGTP, requirements for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of clinical data in support of the BLA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

42




· | payment of the application fee under the Prescription Drug User Free Act, or PDUFA, unless exempted; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the BLA, which may be subject to additional post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS, and any post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies and Investigational New Drug Application
Before testing any investigational biological product in humans, including a gene or cell therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate the potential for efficacy and toxicity in animals. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including applicable GLP requirements. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application.
An IND is an exemption under the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug or biological product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol or protocols for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The IND also includes results of preclinical studies and other evaluations regarding the characteristics of the product, including chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. The IND is a request for FDA authorization to test the drug or biological product candidate in humans and automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the product or conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before the clinical trials can begin. Preclinical or nonclinical testing typically continues even after the IND is submitted.
FDA may, at any time during the initial 30-day IND review period or while clinical trials are ongoing under the IND, impose a partial or complete clinical hold based on concerns for patient safety and/or noncompliance with regulatory requirements. This order issued by the FDA would delay a proposed clinical study or cause suspension of an ongoing study until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed, and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. Imposition of a clinical hold could cause significant delays or difficulties in completing planned clinical studies in a timely manner.
Human Clinical Trials in Support of a BLA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease to be treated under the supervision of qualified principal investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor's control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation.
Clinical trials are conducted under study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the trial complies with certain FDA regulatory requirements in order to use the trial as support for an IND or application for marketing approval in the U.S. Specifically, the FDA requires that such trials be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and that FDA must be able to validate the data from such clinical trials through onsite inspections, if FDA deems such inspections necessary.

43



For clinical trials conducted in the United States, an IND is required, and each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, clinical trial design, patient informed consent, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Clinical trials must also comply with extensive GCP rules and the requirements for obtaining subjects' informed consent. The FDA, IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements, including GCP, or the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group may recommend continuation of the study as planned, changes in study conduct or cessation of the study at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the study. Finally, research activities involving infectious agents, hazardous chemicals, recombinant DNA, and genetically altered organisms and agents may be subject to review and approval of an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC, in accordance with NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules. The IBC is a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to the public health or the environment, and such assessment may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may be required after approval.

· | Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or, in the case of some products designed to address severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and recommended dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population at multiple geographically dispersed clinical study sites to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a biologic; such Phase 3 studies are generally referred to as "pivotal," however, in for some product candidates, Phase 2 may be considered pivotal trials if such trials are expected to provide the clinical evidence needed to support a marketing application.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate's safety or effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are sometimes referred to as Phase 4 confirmatory trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and potentially to verify a clinical benefit in the case of biologics approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products. The FDA generally recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene-therapy related delayed adverse events in a long-term follow-up study of fifteen years for integrating vectors, up to fifteen years for genome editing products and up to five years for AAV vectors. FDA recommends that these long-term follow-up studies include, at a minimum, five years of annual physical examinations followed by annual queries, either in-person or by phone or written questionnaire, for the remaining observation period.

44



Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, a BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must submit a pediatric study plan to FDA outlining the proposed pediatric study or studies they plan to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The FDA must then review the information submitted, consult with the sponsor and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
For products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than 90 days after FDA's receipt of the study plan. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements, under specified circumstances. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. Similar requirements for posting clinical trial information in clinical trial registries exist in the EU and in other countries outside the United States.
Marketing Applications for Combination Products
We expect that our product candidates may be subject to regulation as biologic-device combination products. In the United States, products composed of components that would normally be regulated by different centers at FDA are known as combination products. Typically, FDA determines which Center will lead a product's review based upon the product's primary mode of action. Depending on the type of combination product, its approval, clearance or licensure may usually be obtained through the submission of a single marketing application. Regardless of whether our product candidate is considered a biologic-device combination product, we anticipate that our product candidates will be regulated by CBER which will have primary jurisdiction over premarket development and approval. If our product candidates are regulated as biologic-device combination products, FDA may permit a single regulatory submission seeking approval for the product, however, FDA could require separate marketing applications for individual constituent parts of the combination product which may require additional time, effort and information. Even when a single marketing application is required for a combination product, such as a BLA for a combination biologic and device product, both CBER and FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health may participate in the review. If a product candidate is considered a biologic-device combination product, an applicant will also need to discuss with the Agency how to apply certain premarket requirements and post-marketing regulatory requirements, including conduct of clinical trials, adverse event reporting and good manufacturing practices, including applicable portions of the FDA's Quality System regulation, to their combination product.
Compliance with cGMP Requirements
Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in full compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products like biologics whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. Material changes in manufacturing equipment, location, or process post-approval, may result in additional regulatory review and approval.
For products that comprise or incorporate human cells, tissues, and cellular or tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with cGTP. These standards are found in FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of HCT/Ps. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner 

45



designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing.
Review and Approval of a BLA
The results of product candidate development, preclinical testing and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, information on the chemistry and composition of the biological product candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting license to market the product. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
The FDA has 60 days after submission of the application to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the application. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority review application. A major amendment to a BLA submitted at any time during the review cycle, including in response to a request from the FDA, may extend the goal date by three months. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs.
During its review of a BLA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. In particular, the FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions about a BLA.
Under the PHSA, the FDA may approve a BLA if it determines that the product is safe, pure, and potent and that the facility where the product will be manufactured meets standards designed to ensure that it continues to be safe, pure and potent.
On the basis of the FDA's evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and any FDA audits of non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific labeling for specific indications. If the application is not approved, the FDA will issue a complete response letter, which will contain the conditions that must be met in order to secure approval of the application, and when possible will outline recommended actions the sponsor might take to obtain approval of the application. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. Such resubmissions are classified under PDUFA as either Class 1 or Class 2. The classification of a resubmission is based on the information submitted by an applicant in response to an action letter. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has two months to review a Class 1 resubmission and six months to review a Class 2 resubmission. The FDA will not approve an application until issues identified in the complete response letter have been addressed.
If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. It may also require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess the product's safety or efficacy after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but 

46



are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy Designations
The FDA has several programs designed to expedite the development and approval of drugs and biological products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation, and regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation. These designations are not mutually exclusive, and a product candidate may qualify for one or more of these programs. While these programs are intended to expedite product development and approval, they do not alter the standards for FDA approval.
The FDA may grant a product fast track designation if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for such disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA, and a fast track product's application may also be eligible for "rolling review," under which the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. Fast track designation may be rescinded if FDA believes that the product candidate no longer meets the qualifying criteria.
A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The breakthrough therapy designation provides all the benefits of the fast track program, including the eligibility for rolling review. The FDA may take certain administrative actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to aid sponsors in designing the clinical trials in an efficient manner. Breakthrough designation may be rescinded if the FDA believes that the product candidate no longer meets the qualifying criteria.
In 2017, the FDA established a new regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act. The RMAT designation program is intended to fulfill the 21st Century Cures Act requirement that the FDA facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any drug or biologic that meets the following criteria: (i) the drug or biologic qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (ii) the drug or biologic is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (iii) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. RMAT designation provides all the benefits of breakthrough therapy designation, including more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Product candidates granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. Once approved, when appropriate, the FDA can permit fulfillment of post-approval requirements under accelerated approval through the submission of clinical evidence, preclinical studies, clinical trials, patient registries or other sources of real world evidence such as electronic health records, the collection of larger confirmatory datasets, or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with the therapy prior to approval. FDA may designate a product candidate for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of such condition. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and it shortens the FDA's goal for taking action on an original BLA from 10 months to six months from the filing date.

47



Accelerated Approval Pathway
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product candidate designed to treat a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
For drugs or biologics granted accelerated approval, FDA generally requires sponsors to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product's clinical benefit. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies with due diligence, failure to confirm a clinical benefit during the post-approval studies may result in the FDA's withdrawal of the product's approval on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated approval are subject to prior review by the FDA unless FDA informs the applicant otherwise.
​
Post-approval Regulation
Upon FDA approval of a BLA, the sponsor must comply with extensive post-approval regulatory requirements applicable to biological products, including any additional post-approval requirements that the FDA may impose as part of the approval process. These post-approval requirements include, among other things:

· | record keeping requirements;
--+-----------------------------


· | reporting of certain adverse experiences with the product and production problems to the FDA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission of updated safety and efficacy information to the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | drug sampling and distribution requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | notifying FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing and labeling changes; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with requirements concerning advertising, promotional labeling, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and other promotional activities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced regulatory inspections for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP and pharmacovigilance regulations. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
In addition, the FDA strictly regulates the advertising and labeling of prescription drug products, including biological products. Promotional claims about a drug's safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. Once a drug is approved, the sponsor can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product's labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer's communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes 

48



or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or dosing regimens, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
The FDA may withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or issues with manufacturing processes, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety signals or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product recall, seizure, or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | notifying FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing and labeling changes; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

Orphan Drug Designation
Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for certain tax credits. In addition, if a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years following product approval unless the subsequent product candidate is demonstrated to be clinically superior. Absent a showing of clinical superiority, FDA cannot approve the same product made by another manufacturer for the same indication during the market exclusivity period unless it has the consent of the sponsor or the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities. The concept of what constitutes the "same drug" for purposes of orphan drug exclusivity remains in flux in the context of gene therapies, and in January 2020, the FDA issued draft guidance outlining its interpretation of sameness in the context of gene therapy products, and stated it does not intend to consider two gene therapy products to be different drugs based solely on minor differences in the transgenes and/or vectors.
A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition 

49



if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first drug. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation. To qualify for orphan exclusivity, however, the drug must be clinically superior to the previously approved product that is the same drug for the same condition. If a product designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent regulatory exclusivity in the United States. Specifically, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act provides for the attachment of an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added on to the term of any remaining regulatory exclusivity or patent periods at the time the pediatric exclusivity is granted. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data, even if the data do not show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, which was signed into law in March 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars.
Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biological product that is "biosimilar to" or "interchangeable with" a previously approved biological product or "reference product." In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient, and (for products administered multiple times to an individual) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. A product shown to be biosimilar or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product may rely in part on the FDA's previous determination of safety and effectiveness for the reference product for approval, which can potentially reduce the cost and time required to obtain approval to market the product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. At this juncture, it is also unclear whether products deemed "interchangeable" by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. This 12-year exclusivity period is referred to as the reference product exclusivity period and bars approval of a biosimilar but notably does not prevent approval of a competing product pursuant to a full BLA (i.e., containing the sponsor's own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of the product). The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity and enforceability prior to the approval of the biosimilar.
There have been ongoing federal legislative and administrative efforts as well as judicial challenges seeking to repeal, modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA. While none of those efforts have focused on changes to the provisions of the PPACA related to the biosimilar regulatory framework, if those efforts continue and if the PPACA is repealed, substantially modified or invalidated, it is unclear what, if any, impact such action would have on biosimilar regulation.

50



Patent Term Restoration and Extension
A patent claiming a new biological product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for a single patent for an approved product as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of a marketing application less any dime during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date less any dime during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
Regulation and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products in the EU and the United Kingdom
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the EU generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU.
Following Brexit, which became fully effective on January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom regulates medicinal products under a separate but similar regulatory regime. The United Kingdom legislation is in the process of being developed and changes to the currently published regulatory system might be encountered at relatively short notice. Northern Ireland remains under the EU regulatory system.
Marketing and Authorization
To obtain a marketing authorization for a cell or gene therapy product under the EU regulatory system, an applicant must submit an application via the centralized procedure administered by EMA. Specifically, the grant of marketing authorization in the EU for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as cell or gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products.
Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision, and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products, and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to the EMA's Committee for Advance Therapies which provides a draft opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization and which is subject to final approval as scientific opinion by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. The European Commission makes its final decision on whether to grant or refuse the marketing authorization on the basis of the CHMP opinion.
Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. A request for accelerated assessment 

51



may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
Until December 31, 2022, applications made in the United Kingdom. following a decision of the EU under a centralized procedure may be expedited using the EU Decision Reliance Procedure. Under this procedure, within five days or receipt of a positive CHMP decision, the same documents as were provided in the EU are provided to the MHRA, which will then make an assessment within 67 days. This period will be delayed only if major objections are identified or substantial amendments to the product information are necessary. It is anticipated that such delays will be rarely encountered.
Regulatory Data Protection in the EU
In the EU, new active substances approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of marketing exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator's data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. This also applies to biosimilars. During the additional two-year period of marketing exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. In addition if a pediatric investigation plan is accepted and implemented, and an application for a marketing authorization in a pediatric indication is filed, then a product which is eligible for a supplementary protection certificate, or SPC, (similar in effect to a patent term extension) may in some cases benefit from a six-month extension to the term of the SPC. If the product is off-patent and not an orphan, the applicant may benefit from a full period of data and marketing exclusivity (for example, 8+2+1 years) in relation to the pediatric indication. Even if a compound is considered to be a new active substance (chemical or biological) so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data and marketing exclusivity, another company may market another version of the same medicinal product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
It is currently expected that the same periods will apply in the United Kingdom, albeit that applications made directly and separately to the MHRA after January 1, 2021 with respect to Great Britain (not including Northern Ireland) will refer to the date of the authorization in Great Britain and therefore may be different from the data exclusivity period for any application made in the EU.
Periods of Authorization and Renewals
A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any authorization that is not followed by the placement of the drug on the EU market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid. The same rules apply in the United Kingdom following Brexit.

52



Regulatory Requirements After Marketing Authorization
Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include compliance with the EU's and the United Kingdom’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. In addition, the manufacturing of authorized products must also be conducted in strict compliance with the EU's GMP requirements, which mandate the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. The EU has also drawn up guidelines which develop the GMP requirements that should be applied in the manufacturing of advanced therapy medicinal products, which would apply to cell and gene therapy products. The United Kingdom is continuing to apply the same regulations as the EU with respect to GMP requirements. The marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended, and through national legislation of the EU member states.
The United Kingdom has always had one of the strictest regimes on marketing and promotion by virtue of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry Code. While it is applicable only to members, it provides a regime that competitor companies operate by and pursuant to which they make complaints. This is enforced by the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority. 
Clinical Trial Approval
Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of each EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after ethical approval covering that site has been obtained in accordance with the applicable national legislation. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC six months after the new clinical trial portal is announced by the European Commission to be ready for use. This new legislation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU by allowing for a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
Applications for clinical trials in the United Kingdom must be made to the United Kingdom through its stand-alone legislation. The application process is the same as in EU member states and ethical approval is also required.
Conditional Marketing Authorization
For medicinal products where the benefit of immediate availability outweighs the risk of less comprehensive data than normally required, based on the scope and criteria defined in legislation and guidelines, it is possible to obtain from the EMA a conditional marketing authorization with a 12-month validity period and annual renewal pursuant to Regulation No 507/2006. These are granted only if the CHMP finds that all four of the following requirements are met: (i) the benefit-risk balance of the product is positive; (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data; (iii) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled; and (iv) the benefit to public health of the medicinal product's immediate availability on the market outweighs the risks due to need for further data.
PRIME Designation in the EU
The EMA has a Priority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme for products falling within the remit of the centralized authorization procedure. The PRIME scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and may provide accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, the potential for frequent discussions on clinical trial 

53



designs and other development program elements, and an expectation of accelerated assessment once a dossier has been submitted.
United Kingdom Licensing Schemes
The United Kingdom has two early-access schemes: the Innovative Licensing and Access Procedure which allows products that are early in the development for innovative products, including biological medicines, allowing for enhanced regulatory input to create; and early access to medicines scheme for patients with life threatening or seriously debilitating conditions. 
There is also the option of a rolling review, where a dossier is submitted and reviewed incrementally, again, with the goal of achieving an authorization decision more quickly.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan medicine by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. If an orphan designation is obtained, the product will generally benefit from ten years of market exclusivity (extended by two further years for products which have also complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan granted at the time of the orphan medicine designation). Market exclusivity means that similar medicines for the same indication generally cannot be placed on the market during the exclusivity period unless the relevant applicant can establish that its medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior. The United Kingdom intends to offer similar incentive schemes for orphan drugs.
General Data Protection Regulation
The collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data, including personal health data, regarding individuals who are located in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, and the processing of personal data that takes place in the EEA, is subject to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, and it imposes heightened requirements on companies that process health and other sensitive data, such as requiring in many situations that a company obtain the consent of the individuals to whom the sensitive personal data relate before processing such data. Examples of obligations imposed by the GDPR on companies processing personal data that fall within the scope of the GDPR include providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, appointing a data protection officer, providing notification of data breaches and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EEA, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance. The United Kingdom and the EU are currently accepting that the privacy regimes of each country are equivalent so that personal might be transferred between those jurisdictions without additional requirements.

54



Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may seek regulatory approval by the FDA or other government authorities. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use any product candidates we may develop unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such product candidates. Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement from third-party payors.
Within the United States, third-party payors include government authorities or government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private entities, such as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Some third-party payors may manage utilization of a particular product by requiring pre-approval (known as "prior authorization") for coverage of particular prescriptions (to allow the payor to assess medical necessity).
Moreover, a third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain net price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor's decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of new products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain or maintain coverage and reimbursement for any current or future product, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product. These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. Thus, obtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is time-consuming and costly.
As noted above, the marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. There is an emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval from one or more third party payors, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
If we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our current product candidates in the United States, we may be required to provide discounts or rebates under government healthcare programs or to certain government and private purchasers in order to obtain coverage under federal healthcare programs such as Medicaid. Participation in such programs may require us to track and report certain drug prices. We may be subject to fines and other penalties if we fail to report such prices accurately. More generally, we may need to provide price concessions to third party payors to obtain favorable coverage or to purchasers to achieve sales. Arrangements with third party payors or purchasers may include value-based arrangements under which the amount paid for products depends on the performance of the product.
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for any product candidates we may develop will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a 

55



product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of any product candidates we may develop to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country because this is not yet the subject of harmonized EU law. Many countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so-called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval and others with "peg" their pricing to a basket of other countries. EU member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market, both are possible in the United Kingdom. Some member states, in addition to controlling pricing will monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.
Healthcare Law and Regulation
Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, third-party payors, and other customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, FDA, and data privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

· | federal false claims, false statements and civil monetary penalties laws prohibiting, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with specific compliance standards, restrict financial interactions between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers or require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to payments to health care providers or marketing expenditures.
Healthcare and Other Reform
In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of significant legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. Federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs.
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty established under Affordable Care Act for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The Affordable Care Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. The case Texas v. Azar, which challenges the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, including provisions that are unrelated to healthcare reform but were enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, was argued before the Supreme Court in November 2020. Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the Affordable Care Act, but the individual mandate to buy health insurance remains in effect. 
Beyond the Affordable Care Act, there have been ongoing health care reform efforts, including a number of recent actions. Some recent healthcare reform efforts have sought to address certain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including an expansion of telehealth coverage under Medicare and accelerated or advanced Medicare payments to healthcare providers. Other reform efforts affect pricing or payment for drug products. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program has been subject to statutory and regulatory changes and the discount that manufacturers of Medicare Part D brand name drugs must provide to Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap from 50% to 70%. A number of regulations were issued in late 2020 and early 2021. For example, effective January 2022, revisions to the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to PBMs and health plans. Some of these changes have been and may continue to be subject to legal challenge. For example, courts temporarily enjoined a new “most favored nation” payment model for select drugs covered under Medicare Part B that was to take effect on January 1, 2021 and would limit payment based on international drug price.
The nature and scope of health care reform in the wake of the transition from the Trump administration to the Biden administration remains uncertain. The Department of Justice under the Biden administration informed the Supreme Court that the government no longer takes the position that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and cannot be severed from the rest of the Affordable Care Act. President Biden has temporarily halted implementation of new rules issued immediately prior to the transition that had not yet taken effect (which include a number of health care reforms) to allow for review by the new administration. More generally, President Biden supported reforms to lower drug prices during his campaign for the presidency.

There have also been efforts by federal and state government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices.
General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our product candidates. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 (Except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021) unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our current or future products if approved for sale. We cannot, however, predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Affordable Care Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.
Facilities
Our principal executive office is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts where we lease a total of approximately 44,188 square feet of office and laboratory space that we use for our administrative, research and development and other activities. We believe that our facilities are enough to meet our current needs and that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had 99 full-time employees. Of these employees, 35 have an M.D. or a Ph.D. From time to time, we also retain independent contractors to support our organization. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Company Founding
We were founded in 2015 by Flagship Pioneering, working together with academic co-founders Drs. Robert Langer and Daniel Anderson of MIT, to develop and commercialize a new category of therapeutics to treat human diseases. Our platform technology was inspired by a decade of work at MIT demonstrating, in principle, that capsules made of novel engineered biomaterials, which do not trigger a foreign body response (or scarring), could be implanted in animals for extended periods and support the survival of cells producing a therapeutic protein without the need for immunosuppression. A Flagship Labs innovation team at Flagship Pioneering, led by Managing Partner Dr. Douglas Cole, M.D., our founding and current Chairman, and, subsequently, Sigilon’s research and development team, built on this seminal work to expand and scale this approach and show its potential to address a range of unmet needs in multiple therapeutic areas. Since our formation, we have established a highly collaborative, patient first culture that drives our passion for innovation. Our management team has extensive expertise in chronic diseases, human genetics and cell and gene engineering. We are led by Dr. Rogerio Vivaldi Coelho, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who has more than 30 years of experience as a physician and as an industry executive. Prior to joining Sigilon, Dr. Vivaldi served as Executive Vice President and Chief Global Therapeutics Officer at Bioverativ Inc. from 2016 until it was acquired by Sanofi S.A. in 2018, and served as Chief Commercial Officer at Spark Therapeutics, Inc. between 2014 and 2016. Before that, he led Genzyme’s rare disease business as President of both the rare disease business and the renal & endocrine group, as well as Senior Vice President and General Manager of Genzyme’s Latin America Group during his 20 year tenure at Genzyme.
