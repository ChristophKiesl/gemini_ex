ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
INTRODUCTION
 
Evolving Systems is a leader in real-time analytics, activation and consumer engagement marketing.  The companys software solutions and managed services are deployed at over 75 mobile service providers in 50 countries worldwide where they accelerate customer acquisition and activation, upsell services, improve subscriber loyalty and monetize consumer information throughout their lifecycle.
 
The acquisition of RateIntegration, Inc. d/b/a Sixth Sense Media (SSM) in 2015 accelerated the companys entry into the high value mobile marketing space and also initiated the transition from a traditional software license model to a recurring revenue model based on managed services.
 
The company has moved from selling technology to offering business solutions. The value proposition likewise has moved away from cost savings to a focus on revenue increases for the carrier and our business model has moved from classic capex license and services to opex models based on managed services with performance fees.
 
We offer managed services and solutions in the following core areas:
 
·                  Subscriber Acquisition and Activation solutions used to sign up new subscribers and to activate complex bundles of voice, video and data services for traditional and next generation wireless, wireline and cable networks;
 ·                  Mobile Analytics, Engagement and Upsell enables carrier marketing departments to innovate, execute and manage highly-personalized and contextually-relevant, interactive campaigns that engage consumers in real time;
 ·                  Retention, Loyalty and Fulfilment solutions that reduce subscriber churn, encourage service usage, and reward subscribers with value from the carrier and from loyalty program partners;
 ·                  Consumer Information Monetization enables mobile service providers to monetize their consumer information and context through the up-selling of digital services like games and apps and mobile advertising.
 
We previously reported the operations of our business as two operating segments based on revenue type: license and services revenue and customer support revenue.  In order to report results consistent with our new business solutions model, we now report our operations as one segment since we are packaging multiple products and services into offerings for carriers. We report geographic information based upon revenue and long-lived assets in the United States, United Kingdom and all other foreign countries as a group.  Further information regarding our operating segments and geographical information is contained in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
COMPANY BACKGROUND
 
Evolving Systems was founded in 1985 to provide software and services to the U.S. telecommunications industry.  During our early years our product focus was on solutions that supported number management and number porting. In November 2004, we expanded our product set and geographical reach with the acquisition of Tertio Telecoms Ltd. (Evolving Systems U.K.), a supplier of Operations Support Systems (OSS) software solutions for service activation and mediation to communication carriers throughout

Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. With this acquisition we not only expanded our markets beyond North America, we also added service activation and billing mediation solutions to our product portfolio. The acquisition significantly expanded our product and service capabilities, allowing us to address a larger portion of our customers OSS application needs with a balanced mix of products as well as services.  We currently focus primarily on the wireless markets in the areas of mobile marketing analytics, subscriber activation, SIM card management and activation, selfservice mobile applications, data enablement solutions, connected device activation and management of services.
 
On October 24, 2013 we acquired privately held Telespree Communications (Telespree), now known as Evolving Systems Labs, Inc. (Evolving Systems Labs), for an initial payment of approximately $1.6 million, comprised of approximately $0.8 million in cash and approximately $0.8 million in stock.  There was an earn-out provision whereby we potentially would have made additional payments in cash on the achievement of certain financial targets for the period from October 25, 2013 through October 24, 2016.  This provision was not achieved and was recognized as other income in 2016.  In addition, there is a final payment of $0.5 million to be made subject to reduction for certain claims.  The final payment has not been made as of the date of this Form 10-K was filed.  The acquisition included technology used in the delivery and management of mobile data services and a portfolio of SaaS based solutions.
 
On September 30, 2015, we acquired privately held SSM, now known as Evolving Systems NC, Inc. (Evolving Systems NC) for an initial cash payment totaling approximately $9.75 million, plus customary working capital adjustments, and we agreed to make a payment of $250,000 on the one year anniversary of the transaction, with such payment being available to secure SSMs representations and warranties under the acquisition agreement. The acquisition included SSMs software solution, RLM, a platform which enables carrier marketing departments to innovate, execute and manage highly-personalized and contextually-relevant, interactive campaigns that engage consumers in real time as well as a platform for Customer Loyalty and Retention.  The final payment has not been made as of the date this Form 10-K was filed due to pending resolution of outstanding claims.
 
INDUSTRY DYNAMICS
 
The market for mobile marketing analytics, communications activation and provisioning solutions is constantly changing. Several key factors are driving carrier demand for next generation solutions, supporting growth for specific products within the sector:
 
·                      Carriers seeking to further monetize their customer relationships and associated demographic, behavioral, location and contextual information to up-sell their network services and open new channels for optimized and personalized third-party service revenues;
 ·                      Rapid adoption of smart phones and network-attached devices, driving increased usage of mobile data;
 ·                      On-going network investment to provide vastly improved delivery speeds and capacity (Long Term Evolution, or LTE/4G);
 ·                      Pricing pressure within the telecom industry driven by relatively flat subscriber growth, network upgrade costs, subscriber churn, and increased competition from traditional and new market entrants such as Over-the-Top (OTT) services both in the developed and emerging markets; and
 ·                      Adoption of the connected device and M2M markets.
 
Today, carriers are compelled to offer a growing array of services to deliver personalized and differentiated user experiences, reduce subscriber churn and maintain or grow market share. These value-added services have to be delivered to the market in ever shorter windows as competitive pressure has increased the velocity at which carriers deliver new products and services. To achieve these objectives, operators are increasingly reliant on flexible service enablement solutions that offer a myriad of options for their subscribers.
 
As network migrations to 4G/LTE accelerate and subscribers continue to drive growth in mobile solutions, the SIM card has emerged as a vital link in the telecom value chain. Capability, such as that provided by Evolving Systems Subscriber Activation solution for dynamically activating and managing the SIM card, is becoming an important component in the operators infrastructure, both to reduce operating costs associated with the provisioning of SIM cards, as well as to improve the end-user experience.
 
We are a pioneer and leader in this market and believe we are well-positioned to maintain our leadership role in this growth segment.  To date our Subscriber Activation solution has activated over half a billion SIM cards, providing enhanced functionality and significant operator savings.  Our Mobile Analytics, Engagement, Upsell and Retention solutions are connecting with over 300 million subscribers around the world.

SOLUTIONS PORTFOLIO
 
Acquisition and Activation
 
Our Subscriber Acquisition and Activation solutions support carriers in adding new subscribers to their network, from the sales and contract process through to the allocation of network and service resources and the activation of services to the mobile device.
·                  Smart Dealer provides SIM retailers with a tool set that enables them to sell SIM cards efficiently and effectively. With Smart Dealer, the operator is able to communicate and guide dealers towards using the latest promotions, enabling instant reactions to competitor activities.  Smart Dealer captures subscriber details for Know Your Customer prepaid registration, including biometric data, using standard, low cost devices.
 
·                  Dynamic SIM AllocationTM is a SIM Activation solution which is integrated into the carriers signaling network, enabling new SIM cards that have not been pre-provisioned to be detected on first use. This triggers an efficient, dynamic provisioning process and eliminates the need for pre-provisioning, thus lowering the operators costs of subscriber acquisition. The SIM activation occurs only when a SIM card is first used. During the activation process, the solution enables an on-device interaction with the end-user, delivering a differentiated user-experience, reducing customer churn and boosting revenue for the carrier.
 
·                  Tertio® Service Activation is used by carriers to activate a new subscriber or to add a new service to an existing subscriber.  Our solution provides a flexible operating environment for carriers to manage their voice, data, and content service needs for both their traditional and broadband IP networks. It provides a point of flexibility in the carriers OSS/BSS architecture, allowing fast introduction of new network technologies and easing the burden of integration with existing devices and systems. Service providers who use our Tertio solution can better plan, manage and execute the introduction of new services.
·                  Number Inventory and Management  is a scalable and fully automated solution that enables operators to reliably and efficiently manage their telephone numbers (i.e. SIMs, MSISDNs, IMSIs, Integrated Circuit Card Identifiers (ICCIDs) as well as other communication identifiers such as Uniform Resource Locators or (URLs) and email addresses. Our solution focuses on the automation of all number resource management processes, allowing operators to adhere to regulatory requirements and effectively manage the lifecycle of telephone numbers, as well as benefit from time savings and reduced costs.
Analytics, Engagement and Upsell
 
Our Analytics, Engagement and Upsell solutions empower marketing departments to create and deploy highly personalized, location and contextually relevant, interactive customer engagement campaigns. The platform monitors customer events and behavioural patterns in real-time, building a profile of each subscriber. When the right conditions are met, the platform pushes the best match or a personalized offer or ad to the customer.
 
Compared with many other marketing campaign management systems, our solution more accurately targets marketing messages and campaigns that drive incremental revenue more quickly.
 
·                  The Profiling Engine supports static as well as ongoing dynamic profiling of subscribers. It fully supports any real-time or micro segmentation requirements as needed by the business. The Profiling Engine is a rules-driven flexible aggregator of subscriber baseline and usage data. It has been designed to handle any data model, including any data representation that may be available within the carriers legacy billing and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) environment.
·                  The Campaign Engine is used to configure and deliver marketing campaigns and offers to subscribers. It includes a business friendly dashboard that enables rapid configuration, testing and launching of new business campaigns. Through the dashboard the business user can target specific subscribers, define offers and rewards, and create personalized messages per campaign, interaction and subscriber. The dashboard provides a real-time view on each campaigns effectiveness and impact.
·                  Campaign Modules provide predefined templates for specific types of real-time mobile marketing tactics, including marketing and loyalty for digital services such as mobile money and content, data package upsell and top-up accelerators.

·                  Social Media Integration enables carriers to expand their engagement with subscribers beyond simple network usage and direct channels, and can support social marketing campaigns that leverage the subscribers as a part of the marketing network.
·                  App Promotion engages subscribers when they are first configuring new services or when they are upgrading to mobile devices with new capabilities. It enables carriers to promote the use of their own mobile applications for subscriber care, and also those of third party app publishers, opening possibilities for new revenue streams.
Retention and Loyalty
 
Our subscriber Retention and Loyalty solutions help reduce churn and generate more revenue from existing subscribers by using the latest innovative programs. Strong subscriber loyalty is created by rewarding subscribers via schemes that offer additional carrier services or the services and products of participating partners.
·                  Loyalty Points and Programs are used to reward mobile subscribers for use of the carriers services. Credit is earned in the forms of status points and bonus points. Gamification can be used to encourage the collection of rewards by subscribers and comparison with others in their social group. Loyalty Credit is then exchanged for services or discounts from the carrier, or for digital and physical goods from third party businesses and retail partners.
·                  Coupon Management covers the whole lifecycle of coupons as a medium for delivering rewards. Our solution manages the interface with coupon partners, the delivery of coupons to subscribers, redemption for digital or physical goods, and settlement between carrier and partner.
PROFESSIONAL AND MANAGED SERVICES
 
Our Professional Services team provides expert and vastly experienced consulting services for the customization, integration and deployment of our solutions.  Our services cover all aspects of the project lifecycle, including system architecture, design, software development and customization, system integration, testing, live deployment and production support, program and project level management, post-implementation maintenance and domain and product expertise.
 
Our Managed Services can be delivered on-site at a carrier or remotely. Services range from operational support of our software solutions, through technical services to expand those solutions with new modules and functionality to support new business value, to marketing and customer engagement consultancy that directly drives marketing campaigns for our customers and helps them achieve their business objectives. The Managed Services teams also offer their expertise and experience to create the maximum financial impact to the carrier from using our solutions.
 
Our teams work closely with customers and integration partners and have established long-term relationships with operators in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific regions.
 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 
We develop our software solutions internally and using third party development organizations where specialist technical expertise is required. We conduct research to identify specific industry and customer business needs as well as market requirements and we use that information to determine our investment in product development (PD). We evaluate the market for new products and we leverage our existing product capabilities with enhancements of existing products.  We build investment plans for our principal product areas and we make other investments in tools and product extensions to accelerate the development, implementation and integration process for customer solutions.
 
PD is expensed as incurred.  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we expensed $3.0 million, $3.8 million and $3.6 million, respectively, in PD costs.  The majority of PD investments in 2016 went into the further development and enhancement of our RLM and DSA solutions.
 
SALES AND MARKETING
 
Our sales force is primarily a field organization structured to focus on specific geographical territories around the world: The Americas (North, Central and South), Europe, Middle East and Africa, the Commonwealth of Independent States (comprised of Russia and other former Soviet Republics) South Asia and Asia Pacific. Our sales activities cover both direct sales to carrier customers as well as sales through partners such as Gemalto, Oberthur, and Ericsson, who include our products as part of their wider
 
4




solution offerings, and systems integrators such as Accenture and IBM, who license our technology to customers as part of their delivery engagements.
 
Our solutions and our customers infrastructures are complex, and require a high degree of consultative selling which often results in a long sales cycle in excess of twelve months. In addition, our business relies on incremental revenue from existing customers, which requires regular interaction with customers to discuss enhancements to our existing solutions as well as the introduction of new features and functionality. The sales team is also responsible for making proactive proposals to prospects, as well as managing and delivering responses to competitive tenders. This complex, highly interactive approach, typically results in a long sales cycle, requiring us to invest a considerable amount of time developing business opportunities without guaranteed sales.
 
Our marketing organization supports our sales activities by identifying markets for our products and establishing an awareness of our offerings in those markets through a combination of direct marketing, web marketing, and participation in shows, conferences, and industry bodies. The marketing organization is responsible for maintaining our web site and creating electronic and print-based sales collateral to support our sales activities.
 
COMPETITION
 
The market for telecommunications OSS products and mobile analytics and advertising is competitive and subject to rapid technological change, changing industry standards, regulatory developments and consolidation. We face increasing demand for improved product performance, enhanced functionality, rapid integration capabilities; all in the context of continuing pricing pressure. Our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that often have substantially greater financial, technological, marketing, distribution and other resources, larger installed customer bases and longer-standing relationships with telecommunications customers. The market for telecommunications OSS software and services is extremely large and we currently hold only a small portion of total market share.  Nonetheless, we believe our work to establish the Subscriber Acquisition and Activation area has resulted in our achieving a measurable and reasonable market share in those areas.
 
Our principal competitors for Subscriber Acquisition and Activation are vendors such as Comptel-Nokia, Amdocs and Oracle, as well as billing vendors and vendors such as Ericsson.  In the area of Subscriber Acquisition and Activation, we believe we hold a significant leadership position; however, we see occasional competition from Giesecke & Devrient GmbH and HP, as well as a few other smaller regional competitors. Competitors for Analytics, Engagement & Upsell, and for Retention and Loyalty, include specialist vendors such as Knowesis, Pontis and Business Logic Systems, as well as some products in general CRM suites from vendors such as SAS and Oracle.
 
For all of our products, our ability to compete successfully depends on a wide range of factors.  First and foremost is our ability to deliver a managed service based on our solutions platform, which offers a cost effective way for our customers to benefit from our many years of experience and product investment. We deliver value by offering competitively priced quality solutions, tailored specifically to our customers network topography. After a customer implements our products, we often receive subsequent orders for enhancements to add functionality or increase capacity.  Complex solutions tailored to customers needs are expensive and time consuming to replace, thus providing us with an incumbent advantage.  Furthermore, many of our customer relationships span five years or more.  We believe all of these factors give us a competitive advantage and can be a barrier to entry for potential competitors.
 
SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
 
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, no significant customer exceeded the threshold (defined as contributing at least 10%) of revenue from continuing operations.  For the year ended December 31, 2014, two significant customers accounted for 24% (13% and 11%) of revenue from continuing operations.  These customers are large telecommunications operators in Europe and Mexico.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We rely on a combination of patents, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We have 16 patents in the U.S. on elements of our DSA and mobile broadband enablement products and patents pending in other countries on elements of our DSA and other products.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 197 people including 27 in the United States, 34 in the United Kingdom and 136 in India.  Of our worldwide staff, 81% are involved in product delivery, development, support and professional services, 11% in sales and marketing, and 8% in general administration.
