Item 1. Business
OUR COMPANY
Unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms “Comstock,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company” or “the Company” mean Comstock Mining Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

The Company is a Nevada-based, gold and silver mining company with extensive, contiguous property in the historic Comstock and Silver City mining districts (collectively, the “Comstock District”). The Comstock District is located within the western portion of the Basin and Range Province of Nevada, between Reno and Carson City. The Company began acquiring properties and developing projects in the Comstock District in 2003. Since then, the Company has consolidated a substantial portion of the historic Comstock District, secured permits, built an infrastructure and brought exploration projects into production. 

Because of the Comstock District’s historical significance, the geology is well known and has been extensively studied by the Company, our advisors and many independent researchers. We have expanded our understanding of the geology of the project area through vigorous surface mapping and drill hole logging. The volume of geologic data is immense, and thus far the reliability has been excellent, particularly in the various Lucerne Mine areas. We have amassed a large library of historic data and detailed surface mapping of Comstock District properties and continue to obtain historic information from private and public sources. We use such data in conjunction with information obtained from our current mining operations, to target geological prospective exploration areas and plan exploratory drilling programs, including expanded surface and underground drilling.
Our Lucerne Resource area is located in Storey County, Nevada, approximately three miles south of Virginia City and 30 miles southeast of Reno. Our Dayton Resource area is located in Lyon County, Nevada, approximately six miles south of Virginia City. Access to the properties is by State Route 341/342, a paved road.
The Company continues evaluating and acquiring properties, expanding its footprint and exploring all of our existing and prospective opportunities for further exploration, development and mining. The near-term goal of our business plan is to maximize intrinsic stockholder value realized, per share, by continuing to acquire mineralized and potentially mineralized properties, exploring, developing and validating qualified resources (measured, indicated and inferred) and reserves (proven and probable) that enable the commercial development of our operations through extended, long-lived mine plans that are economically feasible and socially responsible, including both the Lucerne and Dayton Mine plans, with both surface and underground development opportunities. We also plan to develop longer-term exploration plans for the remaining areas, which include the Spring Valley, the Northern Extension, Northern Targets and Occidental areas, subsequent to and in the case of the Spring Valley, concurrent with the exploration and development of Lucerne and Dayton.
The Company achieved initial production and held its first pour of gold and silver on September 29, 2012. The Company produced approximately 22,925 gold equivalent ounces in 2015, the Company’s second full year in production and 5,099 gold equivalent ounces in 2016. That is, the Company produced 19,601 ounces of gold and 222,416 ounces of silver in 2015 and 4,086 ounces of gold and 75,657 ounces of silver in 2016. 
The Company’s headquarters, mine operations and heap leach processing facility are in Storey County, Nevada, at 1200 American Flat Road and 117 American Flat Road, approximately three miles south of Virginia City, Nevada and 30 miles southeast of Reno, Nevada. The Company continues acquiring additional properties in the Comstock District, expanding its footprint and creating opportunities for further exploration, development and mining. The Company now owns or controls approximately 8,631 acres of mining claims and parcels in the Comstock and Silver City Districts. The acreage is comprised of approximately 2,266 acres of patented claims (private lands), surface parcels (private lands), and approximately 6,365 acres of unpatented mining claims, which the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) administers. 
The Company’s real estate segment owns significant non-mining properties, including the Gold Hill Hotel, the Daney Ranch, 98-acre Silver Springs property, including senior water rights and other lands, homes and cottages. The Gold Hill Hotel consists of an operating hotel, restaurant and a bar. In 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to lease the Gold Hill Hotel to independent operators while retaining ownership. The initial term of the lease agreement was effective on April 1, 2015, and ends in March 2020. The tenant may renew the lease for two extended terms of five years each. Lease payments are due in monthly installments. 

Financial information for each of our segments is disclosed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

Current Projects

The Company has identified six distinct target areas on its land holdings and has focused, to date, solely on the Lucerne Resource area (including surface and underground) and the Dayton Resource area. We anticipate developing exploration plans for the remaining areas, which include the Spring Valley, Northern Extension, Northern Targets, and Occidental Target areas, subsequent to the exploration and development of Lucerne and Dayton. The Company’s existing heap leach processing facility for gold and silver was redesigned and expanded in late 2013 and again in the fourth quarter of 2014, to accommodate future production plans.

The Lucerne Resource area has been the primary focus of the Company’s exploration and development efforts since 2007. It includes the previously mined Billie the Kid, Hartford and Lucerne mining claims, and extends east and northeasterly to the area of the historic Woodville bonanza, Succor and Lager Beer claims and north to the historic Justice and Keystone mines. The Company has the key mining permits required for mining this area. The Lucerne Resource area is approximately 5,000 feet long, with an average width of 600 feet, representing less than three percent of the land holdings controlled by the Company and is the site of our current production activities and ongoing exploration and development program. 

The Dayton Resource area is southwest of Silver City in Lyon County, Nevada. It generally includes the Dayton, Kossuth and Alhambra claims, including the old Dayton Consolidated mine workings, south to where the Kossuth claim crosses State Route 341. The historic Dayton mine was the last major underground mining operation in the Comstock District, before being closed after the War Production Board promulgated Limitation Order L-208, 7 F. R. 7992 on October 8, 1942, that closed down all gold mining operations in the United States and its territories. The Dayton Resource area ranks as one of the Company’s top exploration and potential mine production targets. In January 2014, the Lyon County Board of Commissioners approved a strategic master plan and zoning changes on the Dayton, Kossuth and Alhambra mining claims and other properties located in the Dayton Resource area, enabling a more practical, comprehensive feasibility study for mining. Geological studies and development planning are currently underway utilizing data from the 30,818 feet of drilling completed in 2015, and data from prior drill programs.
The Spring Valley exploration target lies at the southern end of the Comstock District, where the mineralized structures lie mostly concealed beneath a veneer of sediment gravels. The area includes the Kossuth patented claim south of State Route 341, the Dondero patented property, the Daney patented claim, the New Daney lode mining claims, and the Company’s placer mining claims in Spring Valley and Gold Canyon.

The Northern Extension, Northern Targets and Occidental areas represent longer-term exploration target areas that contain many historic mining operations, including the Overman, Con Imperial, Caledonia, and Yellow Jacket mines. We believe that our consolidation of the Comstock District has provided us with opportunities to utilize the historical information available to identify drilling targets with significant potential.

We did not have a real estate segment for any period prior to fiscal year 2011. See Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our segments.
Government Regulation

Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances, and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for substantially all of those licenses, permits, and other authorizations currently required for our mining, exploration and other development programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations. Capital expenditures relating to compliance with laws and regulations that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, comprise a substantial part of our historical capital expenditures and our anticipated future capital expenditures. For example, we incur certain expenses and liabilities associated with our reclamation obligations. See “Reclamation” section below.
Reclamation

We are generally required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping, and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with plans reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.

The Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 519A to 519A.280 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 519A.010 to 519A.415 promulgated by the Nevada State Environmental Commission and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (“NDEP”), Bureau of Mining and Reclamation (“BMRR”) require a surety bond to be posted for mining projects so that after completion of the work on such mining projects, the sites are left safe, stable and capable of providing for a productive post-mining use. Over the past four years, the Company has provided a reclamation surety bond, through the Lexon Surety Group (“Lexon”), with the BMRR. The BMRR, with concurrence from Storey County, has approved our most recent reclamation

plan, as revised, and our estimated total costs related thereto of approximately $7.7 million, including, $7.1 million for BMRR and $0.6 million of additional reclamation surety bonding primarily with Storey County. For the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, the Company had provided estimates and surety bonds in the amounts of $11.6 million and $8.6 million, respectively. 
As part of the surety agreement, the Company agreed to pay a 2.0% annual bonding fee and has signed a corporate guarantee. The cash collateral percentage held on deposit by Lexon is typically 25.0% or less of the current bond amount. The current bond amount with the State and County is $7.7 million and at December 31, 2016, $2.5 million of collateral was held on deposit. 

Competition

We compete with other mineral exploration and mining companies in connection with the acquisition of gold and other mineral properties and the attraction and retention of human capital. Such competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than we do.
History

The Company began acquiring properties and developing projects in the Comstock District in 2003. The Company produced over 12,000 ounces of gold and over 53,000 ounces of silver from 2004-2006 from our existing Lucerne mine and American Flat heap leach processing facilities. Our test mining activities were concluded in January 2007, when based on our longer-term production plans, we prioritized land consolidation and mine planning. The Company restarted mining operations in the third quarter of 2012 and resumed pouring doré bars of silver and gold in September 2012. The Company produced over 59,454 ounces of gold and over 734,492 ounces of silver from September 2012 through December 2016, achieving annual rate of 22,925 gold equivalent ounces in 2014. The Company completed leaching from its existing leach pads in December 2016, and has transitioned to exploration and development activities, primarily in the Lucerne and Dayton Resource areas.
Customers

Substantially all mining revenues recorded to date relate to the same customer. As gold can be sold through numerous gold market traders worldwide, the Company is not economically dependent on a limited number of customers for the sale of its product. The real estate segment has numerous customers and is not dependent on any one customer.
Financing Events

In March and April 2016, the Company completed two equity financing transactions totaling $4.0 million (approximately $3.5 million, net of issuance costs). The proceeds were used to accelerate certain prerequisites, including interim mine planning and expanded exploration and development activities for the next phase of Dayton drilling and development and general corporate purposes.
During 2016, the Company entered into a sales agreement with respect to an at-the-market offering program (“ATM Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of its common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $5.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company issued 1,835,300 shares of common stock through the Company’s at-the-market offering program. Gross proceeds from the issuance of shares totaled approximately $0.5 million.
