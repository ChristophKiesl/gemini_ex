ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General Development of Business
 
Hickok Incorporated was founded in 1910 and organized in 1915 as an Ohio corporation, and first offered its securities to the public in 1959. Except as otherwise stated, the terms "Company" or "Hickok" as used herein mean Hickok Incorporated and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Supreme Electronics Corp., Federal Hose Manufacturing LLC, and Hickok AE LLC, doing business as Air Enterprises. Hickok is a publicly traded holding company serving diverse markets, including healthcare, education, automotive, aerospace, trucking, and petrochemical.
 
The Company operates three reportable business segments: (1) Test and Measurement, (2) Industrial Hose and (3) Commercial Air Handling.
 
The Test and Measurement segment is the legacy business that existed prior to 2016. This business segment includes electronic testing products designed and manufactured for the automotive and trucking industries. It also includes indicators and gauges for the locomotive and aircraft industries. The automotive diagnostic products are sold to original equipment manufacturers and to the aftermarket under several brand names and through a variety of distribution methods. In the aircraft industry, primary customers are manufacturers of commercial, military and personal airplanes. In the locomotive industry, indicators and gauges are sold to manufacturers and servicers of railroad equipment and locomotives.
 
The Industrial Hose segment was started on July 1, 2016, when the Company purchased the assets of the Federal Hose business in Painesville, Ohio. This business segment includes the manufacture of flexible interlocking metal hoses and the distribution of silicone hoses. Metal hoses are sold primarily to major heavy-duty truck manufacturers and major aftermarket suppliers in North America. Metal hoses are also sold into the agricultural, industrial and petrochemical markets. Silicone hoses are distributed to a number of industries in North America, including agriculture and general industrial markets. 
 
The Commercial Air Handling segment was added on June 1, 2017, when the Company purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Air Enterprises Acquisition LLC in Akron, Ohio. The acquired business, which operates under the name Air Enterprises, is an industry leader in designing, manufacturing and installing large-scale commercial, institutional, and industrial custom air handling solutions. Its customers are typically in the health care, education, pharmaceutical and industrial manufacturing markets in the United States. This segment also sells to select international markets. The custom air handling units are constructed of non-corrosive aluminum, resulting in sustainable, long-lasting, and energy efficient solutions with life expectancies of 50 years or more. These products are distributed through a network of sales representatives, based on relationships with health care networks, building contractors and engineering firms. The custom air handling equipment is designed, manufactured and installed under the brand names FactoryBilt® and SiteBilt®. FactoryBilt® air handling solutions are designed, fabricated and assembled in a vertically integrated process entirely within the Akron, Ohio facility. SiteBilt® air handling solutions are designed and fabricated in Akron, but are then crated and shipped to the field and assembled on-site. 
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Raw materials essential to the business segments are acquired from a large number of domestic manufacturers and some materials are purchased from European and Southeast Asian sources.
 
In the Test and Measurement segment, materials acquired from the electronic components industry include transistors, integrated circuits, resistors, capacitors, switches, potentiometers, micro controllers, and other passive parts. Fabricated metal or plastic parts are generally purchased from local suppliers or manufactured by the Company from raw materials. In general, the required materials are available, if ordered with sufficient lead times, from multiple sources at current prices.

The Industrial Hose segment uses various materials in the manufacture of its products, including steel fittings and hose packing consisting of silicone, cotton and copper wire. Two suppliers provide over 50% of inventory purchases in this segment. If any one of these sources of supply were interrupted for any reason, the Company would need to devote additional time and expense in obtaining the same volume of supply from its other qualified sources.
 
Aluminum, the major raw material used in construction of the Commercial Air Handling units, is sourced from one major supplier but is generally readily available from other sources. Copper is used by suppliers of a major component used in the product and the Company maintains relationships with three suppliers of these components to limit vulnerability. The Company maintains relationships with multiple suppliers for most of the other componentry used in assembly of the product, in order to maintain best costs for material and competitive lead times. The majority of materials for this segment are sourced domestically or from Canada. 
 
The Company believes it has adequate sources of supply for its primary raw materials and components and has not had difficulty in obtaining the raw materials, component parts or finished goods from its suppliers.
 
Importance of Patents, Licenses, Franchises, Trademarks and Concessions
The Company presently has several patents that relate to several of its products. The Company believes that its position in the industry is dependent upon its present level of engineering skill, research, sales relationships, production techniques and service. The Company has several basic methodology patents related to products it offers that it considers very important to future revenue for certain products and services in its Test and Measurement segment. Of the Company's most critical patents, one is related to the testing of evaporative emissions systems that was the basis for the Company's product offering for the State of California. This patent expires in the year 2022. Another critical patent is related to vehicle fuel cap testing which expires in 2018. The Company monitors the marketplace for infringement of its patents and intends to pursue its rights should an infringement take place. Other than the names "Hickok," "Waekon," “Federal Hose” and “Air Enterprises” and the FactoryBilt® and SiteBilt® registered trademarks, the Company does not have any material licenses, franchises or concessions. 
Seasonality
The Company believes that there is a seasonality to the automotive aftermarket revenues. Typically, the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year tend to be weaker than the other two quarters in this market. Orders from original equipment manufacturers and for emissions testing products are primarily subject to customer timing requirements and have no known seasonality aspect to them. As a result, operating results can fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. In light of the markets served by its products, the Company does not believe that its Industrial Hose or Commercial Air Handling businesses are seasonal in nature.
Dependence on Single or Few Customers
In fiscal year 2017, there were no sales to any one customer greater than 10% of consolidated sales of the Company. Revenue in fiscal year 2016 to one customer was approximately $1.3 million or 20% of the consolidated sales of the Company and was directly related to the acquisition of the Industrial Hose segment. In fiscal year 2015, sales to the customer Bosch amounted to approximately $2.2 million or 37% of the consolidated sales of the Company, which at the time consisted of only the Test and Measurement segment. The Company does not have exclusive supply agreements or long-term contractual relationships with these large customers.
Competitive Conditions
 The Company is engaged in highly competitive industries and faces competition from domestic and international firms. Competition with respect to the Test and Measurement business arises from the existence of a number of other significant manufacturers in the field, which dominate the available market in terms of total sales. The Company believes that its competitive position in this segment is in the area of smaller, specialized products, an area in which the Company has operated and in which the Company has established itself competitively by offering high-quality, high-performance products. Competition in the Industrial Hose segment comes from domestic and international suppliers. The Company believes that its products in this segment are largely commodities, but the Company is differentiated by a well-known brand name and excellent customer service. Competition in the Commercial Air Handling segment comes from both custom and non-custom air handling solution manufacturers. The Company believes that it has a strong competitive position due to the high quality and long life of the Company’s customized aluminum air handling solutions.

Research and Development Activities
The Company expensed product development costs of $0.8 million in 2017, $1.1 million in 2016, and $1.0 million in 2015. These expenditures included engineering product support and development of manuals for the Company's Test and Measurement business segment. The research and development costs of the Industrial Hose and Commercial Air Handling segments are minimal and not separated from other operating costs of the segments.
 
Number of Persons Employed
Total employment by the Company at September 30, 2017 was 180 full-time employees which represents an increase from 95 employees from fiscal 2016.
 
Financial Information Concerning Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales
