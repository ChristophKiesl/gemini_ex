Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are pioneering a new way to treat the underlying causes of severe genetic diseases by precisely upregulating protein expression. We are developing novel antisense oligonucleotide (“ASO”) medicines that target ribonucleic acid (“RNA”) and modulate precursor-messenger RNA splicing to upregulate protein expression where needed and with appropriate specificity to near normal levels. We utilize our proprietary RNA therapeutics platform, Targeted Augmentation of Nuclear Gene Output (“TANGO”), to design ASOs to upregulate the expression of protein by individual genes in a patient. Our approach is designed to allow us to deliver in a highly precise, durable and controlled manner disease-modifying therapies to a wide range of relevant tissues, including the central nervous system, eye, kidney and liver. 
 We were incorporated in June 2014. In July 2015 and April 2016, we entered into worldwide license agreements with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (“CSHL”), and the University of Southampton, respectively, with respect to certain licensed patents and applications relating to TANGO. TANGO exploits non-productive splicing events to effect targeted enhancement of protein expression. Since our inception through June 21, 2019, our operations had been financed primarily from the sale of convertible notes payable and our convertible preferred stock. 
 On June 21, 2019, we completed an initial public offering (“IPO”), of our common stock and issued and sold 9,074,776 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $18.00 per share, which included 1,183,666 shares sold upon full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of $151.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting offering costs of approximately $2.5 million.   
 On July 10, 2020, we entered into an “at-the-market” program and sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, and Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, or Stifel, under which we may, from time to time, offer and sell common stock having an aggregate offering value of up to $150.0 million, referred to as our “at-the-market” offering with Cantor and Stifel. As of December 31, 2020, no such shares of our common stock had been offered or sold pursuant to this “at-the-market” program with Cantor and Stifel. We may terminate this at-the-market program at any time, pursuant to its terms. 
 On November 24, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering, of our common stock and issued and sold 2,875,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $39.00 per share, which included 375,000 shares sold upon full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of $104.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.   
 Our proprietary RNA therapeutics platform is based on the pioneering work conducted on pre-mRNA splicing and ASOs in the laboratory of one of our co-founders, Adrian R. Krainer, Ph.D., of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. Inspired by the clinical success of SPINRAZA® (nusinersen), an ASO medicine for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy that was co-invented by Professor Krainer, our company was founded to develop a general antisense approach to upregulate protein expression. TANGO exploits unique, patented mechanisms for antisense-mediated modulation of splicing to prevent the synthesis of naturally occurring non-productive messenger RNA, or mRNA, and to increase the synthesis of productive mRNA to increase production of functional protein. Our technology is amenable to a large number of mutations and can thereby potentially provide a single-drug approach for diseases that are caused by many loss-of-function mutations in a single gene. We have identified approximately 1,200 monogenic, or single gene, diseases which we believe may be amenable to TANGO. We have an intellectual property estate that includes multi-national allowed and pending claims for the TANGO mechanisms, as well as multi-national pending claims relating to compositions of matter of oligonucleotides designed to target specific TANGO elements in genes for more than 140 genetic diseases that we believe are amenable to upregulation of target protein expression using TANGO. 
 We are initially focused on applying the transformative potential of our platform to develop precision medicines for autosomal dominant haploinsufficiency diseases. There are more than 660 known monogenic diseases that are categorized as haploinsufficiencies. These diseases are ones in which only one copy, or allele, of the gene needs to be mutated for the disease or trait to develop, and that mutated allele generates a protein that is severely deficient in amount or activity, resulting in approximately 50% of normal protein expression in the patient. We believe TANGO is well-suited to treat haploinsufficiencies by increasing expression of the healthy, or wild-type, allele, thereby restoring the target protein to near normal levels.

We are developing TANGO as potentially the first precision medicine platform for a category of severe genetic diseases known as autosomal dominant haploinsufficiencies. Existing precision medicine platforms, including gene therapy, gene editing, modified mRNA, protein-based drugs, small molecules and oligonucleotides, have fundamental limitations that make them poorly suited to address haploinsufficiencies. Numerous technical challenges preclude effective application of these modalities to haploinsufficiencies, including: (i) the inability to control level and tissue distribution of target protein expression, (ii) potential irreversible on- and off-target effects, (iii) target gene size limitations, (iv) incompatibility with diseases caused by many mutations, (v) drug manufacturing and (vi) delivery hurdles. There is a need for novel therapeutics that can restore protein expression and address the underlying genetic causes of haploinsufficiencies. 
 Within haploinsufficiency diseases, we continue to prioritize the development of ASOs for the treatment of genetic epilepsies. According to a 2010 publication in Nature Reviews Neurology and a 2018 publication in JAMA Neurology, more than 50% of epilepsies are now recognized as having a genetic basis and more than 30% of patients are refractory to existing therapies, especially those with a genetic epilepsy. Our most advanced program is the potentially first disease-modifying therapy for Dravet syndrome, a severe and progressive genetic epilepsy. Dravet syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in one allele of the SCN1A gene and is characterized by frequent, prolonged, and refractory seizures beginning within the first year of life. Dravet syndrome is difficult to treat and has a poor long-term prognosis. The effects of the disease go beyond seizures and often include severe intellectual and developmental disabilities and other serious health problems, including, notably, sudden premature death in approximately 20% of patients with Dravet syndrome. Current treatments for Dravet syndrome only address the occurrence of seizures, not the underlying cause of disease. According to a 2017 study as published in the Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology Journal, more than 90% of Dravet
 syndrome patients still report suffering from incomplete seizure control with existing antiepileptic regimens. 
 Our executive management team has extensive collective expertise in human genetics and modulation of RNA processes using ASOs, as well as a track record of success in rare disease drug development. Our executive team and co-founders have been previously involved with other companies in the discovery, development and commercialization of many treatments for rare diseases, including Sarepta’s Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) and Biogen’s SPINRAZA. Our scientific and clinical advisory boards are comprised of leading experts in the fields of human genetics, pre-mRNA splicing and ASOs, and neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Their involvement in both academic research and clinical practice allows us to gain proprietary and early insight into emerging biology and clinical practice that informs our business strategy. 
 Our strategy 
 We are using our proprietary RNA therapeutics platform to create ASOs for the treatment of severe genetic diseases. The critical components of our strategy include: 
  
• | Rapidly advance our lead program, STK-001, to clinical proof-of-concept, approval and commercialization. Our MONARCH Phase 1/2a clinical trial in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome is ongoing. In August 2020, we dosed the first patient in the MONARCH Study. We are leveraging previously-validated ASO chemistry, a modality that has been successfully utilized for other diseases, a well-defined patient population based on routine genetic testing and learnings from recently approved drugs for the treatment of Dravet syndrome to inform the clinical and regulatory pathways for STK-001 and minimize potential safety concerns and development risk. We believe STK-001 has the potential to significantly reduce both the occurrence and frequency of seizures and also non-seizure comorbidities. If we see evidence of efficacy following clinical data, then we would plan to meet with regulatory authorities to discuss expedited regulatory pathways. If approved, we intend to leverage a lean, targeted internal commercial organization to bring STK-001 to patients.

• | Prioritize genetic epilepsies for near-term development efforts. We believe that no other haploinsufficiency disease area holds as much clear need or as much promise for near-term medical breakthrough as genetic epilepsies. Leveraging our proprietary database, we have identified over 100 genes that are commonly mutated amongst epilepsy patients and that may be amenable to TANGO. We believe that the learnings from our lead Dravet syndrome program will significantly reduce the developmental risk of subsequent programs in our pipeline, particularly those targeting the CNS. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our pipeline into other disease areas to fully exploit the potential of our proprietary platform. We have built a target discovery process utilizing proprietary bioinformatics algorithms and extensive in-house expertise in whole transcriptome RNA sequencing to rapidly and systematically identify diseases that we believe can be addressed using our platform. In November 2020, we announced the nomination of OPA1 as our next target for preclinical development to treat Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy (“ADOA”). This is the second haploinsufficiency disease similar to Dravet syndrome and provides entry into genetic diseases of the eye. We are also advancing additional early programs focused on multiple targets, including haploinsufficiency diseases 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of the CNS, eye, kidney and liver. Longer-term, we believe that our ASOs may have the potential to upregulate non-mutated genes in biological pathways to treat diseases or conditions that are caused by multiple genes or are multifactorial, such as autoimmune diseases, aging and cancer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintain broad commercial rights to our product candidates. We own commercial rights to our technologies and clinical programs, including our lead product candidate, STK-001. We intend to build a fully integrated biotechnology company and independently pursue the development and commercialization of our key product candidates. As we continue to advance our programs, we may pursue strategic collaborations to share risk and upside in programs with higher inherent biology risk, larger clinical trial sizes or longer or more complex clinical, regulatory or commercial paths. We plan to opportunistically evaluate potential collaboration arrangements and may elect to enter into an arrangement with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company as early as this year. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to strengthen and expand our intellectual property portfolio. We have an intellectual property estate that includes multi-national allowed and pending claims for the TANGO mechanisms, as well as multi-national pending claims relating to compositions of matter of oligonucleotides designed to target specific TANGO elements in genes for more than 140 genetic diseases that we believe are amenable to upregulation of target protein expression using TANGO. Our proprietary position is reinforced by additional technical know-how and trade secrets. We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we identify new targets amenable to TANGO, and we will file additional patent applications as appropriate.

 Genetic diseases and precision medicines 
 Each person’s genetic material, or genome, consists of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, in sequences of genetic code called genes. There are two copies, or alleles, of each gene, which act as instructions to produce specific proteins. When a cell needs to produce a protein, the instructions to make that protein are transcribed from DNA to mRNA for each allele. The initial transcript is called pre-mRNA and contains both protein coding and non-coding elements. During transcription, the non-protein coding elements, such as introns or non-coding exons, are removed in a process called pre-mRNA splicing. Splicing serves to stitch together the coding elements, or exons, to generate mRNA. The mRNA then serves as the instructions to produce protein. Proteins are required for the structure, function, and regulation of the body’s tissues and organs. The key steps for protein synthesis are exemplified in the schematic below. 
 

The DNA in the human genome contains approximately three billion nucleotide base pairs, and small changes, or mutations, routinely occur in the base pairs. A mutation in the gene can alter the amount or activity of the protein. Currently, there are estimated to be over 10,000 diseases caused by a genetic abnormality in an individual gene. These are also known as monogenic diseases. Monogenic diseases can be categorized as either autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant diseases. 
 For diseases that are autosomal recessive, both alleles of a gene must be mutated for the disease or trait to develop. The protein that is generated is severely deficient in amount or activity and typically results in less than 10-25% of normal protein expression in the patient. Conversely, autosomal dominant diseases are those in which only one allele of the gene needs to be mutated for the disease or trait to develop. Autosomal dominant diseases can be broken down into two categories: autosomal dominant gain-of-function or dominant negative and autosomal dominant haploinsufficiency, or loss-of-function. In 
 3


dominant gain-of-function (dominant negative) diseases, the mutant protein possesses a new deleterious or increased function and acts therefore as a toxic protein. In our focus area of haploinsufficiency diseases, the mutated allele generates a protein that is severely deficient in amount or activity and results in approximately 50% of normal protein expression. Haploinsufficiencies include both rare conditions as well as more common disorders. Severe haploinsufficiencies typically arise from spontaneous mutation, and thus the incidence of these diseases is not reduced by pre-conception genetic screening. 
 Multiple therapeutic modalities, including gene therapy, gene editing, modified mRNA, protein-based drugs, small molecules and oligonucleotides are approved or are being developed to address all types of monogenic diseases. However, most of these therapeutic approaches are focused on autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant gain-of-function (dominant negative) diseases. The nature and fundamental limitations of these modalities make them poorly suited to address the underlying genetic cause of haploinsufficiency diseases. Consequently, there has been little focus on drug development for these diseases despite a significant unmet medical need. 
 The table below summarizes the major categories of genetic diseases and the various precision medicine approaches that are actively being used or explored to address them.

 Our precision medicine platform 
 Oligonucleotides 
 Oligonucleotides are short strands of modified RNA or DNA, usually 12-30 nucleotides in length, that are manufactured by chemical synthesis. Single-stranded oligonucleotides that bind to mRNA are called ASOs, which have been developed primarily to downregulate protein expression by RNase H-mediated cleavage of target mRNA. 
 Over the past few years, there has been very limited success in developing clinical ASOs to upregulate protein expression due to a focus on indirect and weakly validated mechanisms of action such as targeting microRNAs or long non-coding RNAs that are associated with a gene transcript. The only exceptions are SPINRAZA, which corrects a unique 
 4


splicing mutation in SMN2, and Exondys-51, which generates an internally-truncated form of dystrophin after removing or ‘skipping’ out a mutated exon to restore the reading frame. Neither drug represents a generalizable strategy to upregulate the expression of protein. Similarly, double-stranded oligonucleotides have been developed primarily to downregulate protein expression by RNA interference mediated cleavage of target mRNA. To date, there has been very limited success in developing clinical double-stranded oligonucleotides to upregulate protein expression. 
 Given these fundamental limitations of existing modalities, most genetic diseases, particularly autosomal dominant haploinsufficiencies, are dramatically underserved by current therapeutic options. Within rare diseases, only 5% of conditions have an approved drug treatment, and most approved drugs only manage symptoms with little impact on outcomes and life expectancy. We believe there is a clear need for our novel ASOs, which precisely upregulate target protein expression and have the potential to provide disease-modifying therapies to treat many diseases beyond the reach of current approaches. 
 Treatment of autosomal dominant haploinsufficiency diseases with TANGO 
 We are developing our proprietary RNA technology platform, TANGO, as potentially the first precision medicine platform for a category of severe genetic diseases known as autosomal dominant haploinsufficiencies. We utilize TANGO to design ASOs to increase the expression of protein by individual genes in a patient. TANGO exploits unique mechanisms for modulation of splicing to prevent the synthesis of naturally occurring non-productive mRNA and increase the synthesis of productive mRNA, resulting in increased production of functional protein. 
 TANGO leverages non-productive mRNA, which is the result of non-productive splicing that leads to either transcript degradation due to non-coding exon inclusion or nuclear retention of transcripts due to intron retention. In some cases, these non-productive splicing events are a part of normal gene regulation, and in all cases the non-productive splicing events are part of the wild-type or normal sequence of the gene. Non-productive mRNA can be produced by both wild-type and mutant alleles and is not translated into protein. 
 We are initially focused on applying the transformative potential of our platform to developing precision medicines for haploinsufficiencies, or disorders in which only one allele of a gene is mutated, resulting in approximately 50% of normal protein expression. We believe our TANGO technology is well-suited to provide a gene-specific increase in expression of the healthy, or wild-type, allele, thereby restoring the target protein to near normal levels. 
 The figures below illustrate the TANGO mechanism for increasing protein synthesis in a prospective patient with a haploinsufficiency. To date, we have demonstrated this TANGO mechanism in preclinical models of haploinsufficiencies. The left panel illustrates the prospective patient with a haploinsufficiency possessing one wild-type allele and one mutant allele. The mutant allele is translated into non-functional protein and results in approximately 50% of normal protein expression. In the right panel, treatment with our ASO would prevent the synthesis of naturally occurring non-productive mRNA and would increase the synthesis of productive mRNA, thereby restoring the target protein to near normal levels. Our preclinical studies show that any increase in mutant mRNA would have no effect on the net protein level. 
 

TANGO mechanisms of action 
 Our ASOs are specifically designed to bind to a desired RNA sequence inside the nuclei of patients’ cells to prevent the occurrence of non-productive splicing. By doing so, our ASOs decrease the amount of non-productive mRNA and increase the level of productive mRNA, leading to the generation of more protein. TANGO operates in a mutation-independent manner, given it utilizes one wild-type allele, and does not alter protein coding splicing isoforms. The net effect is increased 
 5


expression of functional protein from the wild-type allele. The two categories of non-productive splicing events amenable to TANGO are retained introns and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of the resulting mRNA. While we benefit from leveraging previously-validated ASO chemistries, both of these TANGO mechanisms are novel. 
 The first category of non-productive splicing events amenable to TANGO is retained introns. Retained introns are found in approximately 60% of gene transcripts and are part of the wild-type sequence of the gene. In some cases, retained introns are part of normal gene regulation. The non-productive mRNA, which contains these retained introns, remain in the nucleus of the cell and are not translated into protein, and offer a reservoir of non-productive mRNA that can be converted into productive mRNA. Our ASOs bind to the pre-mRNA and redirect the splicing machinery to remove the retained intron. This splice-switching decreases non-productive mRNA and increases productive mRNA, which is translated into increased protein expression from the wild-type allele. This is shown in the figures below, with the left panel illustrating non-productive mRNA, which includes retained introns, and the right panel illustrating our ASOs binding to the pre-mRNA and redirecting the splicing machinery.

The second category of non-productive splicing events amenable to TANGO is alternative splicing that leads to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, or NMD, of the resulting mRNA. An example of a NMD event is a NMD exon, which is found in over 25% of gene transcripts. Like retained introns, NMD exons are part of the wild-type sequence of the genes. In some cases, NMD exons are part of normal gene regulation. Non-productive mRNA, which includes these NMD exons, is degraded in the cytoplasm of the cell by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and is not translated into protein. Our ASOs bind to the pre-mRNA and redirect the splicing machinery to prevent inclusion of the NMD exon. As with retained introns, this splice-switching decreases non-productive mRNA and increases productive mRNA, which is translated into increased protein expression from the wild-type allele. In contrast to current exon skipping therapies, which remove a coding exon and result in a truncated protein, our TANGO mechanism skips out a non-coding NMD exon and yields a full-length functional protein. Our lead product candidate, STK-001, targets an NMD exon and the general mechanism is shown in the figure below, with the left panel showing the non-productive mRNA failing to be translated into protein and the right panel showing our ASOs binding to the pre-mRNA and redirecting the splicing machinery. Although STK-001 is currently our only current clinical product candidate, we would expect, based on our preclinical studies, for future product candidates targeting a NMD exon to operate in the same manner. 
 

Advantages of TANGO 
 We believe TANGO may have several key advantages, including: 
  
• | Ability to address the underlying genetic cause of the disease. We utilize TANGO to design ASOs to precisely upregulate protein expression, thereby addressing the underlying cause of the disease rather than the symptoms of the disease. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Applicability is mutation-independent. Our ASOs upregulate expression of the wild-type allele, meaning the TANGO mechanism does not rely on targeting a specific mutation. Given this, we believe our therapies are well-suited for diseases caused by multiple mutations in a single gene, such as many haploinsufficiencies, and provide a single-drug approach that can address the full spectrum of loss-of-function mutations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utility across small and large gene targets encoding intracellular and extracellular proteins. Our ASOs upregulate protein expression regardless of gene size and are not constrained to smaller gene targets. We believe our therapies also have the flexibility to address genes encoding intracellular as well as extracellular proteins. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No observed unwanted off-target effects. Our ASOs do not create detectable changes at the DNA level and make no detectable irreversible modifications to a patient’s genome. The activities of our ASOs are inherently tissue-specific. TANGO-mediated upregulation of protein expression only occurs where the gene is being naturally transcribed, limiting the likelihood of expression in non-native tissues. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to control dose level and duration. Our ASOs provide the ability for dose titration, thereby allowing for dose-dependent and reversible control of level and duration of protein expression. The ability to titrate dosage provides us with flexibility to address a variety of tissue types, and potentially enables us to deliver the right dose, at the right location, for each indication. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utility across wide array of diseases and tissue types. We believe that ASO delivery to the CNS, eye, kidney and liver is well-established, providing us the potential to address a broad range of genetic diseases. Additionally, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7


 
although FDA approval for any of our current or future product candidates is not assured, we believe that ASO delivery to the CNS is particularly well-precedented.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fixed dose, rather than weight-based dosing. We have observed that while the quantity of non-productive mRNA can vary across tissue types for a gene, it remains constant across individuals. As a result, for CNS and eye targets, the dose of our ASOs should not require adjustment between patients to be effective. We believe that a fixed dose across all ages in these targets will lessen reimbursement hurdles associated with a weight-adjusted dose pricing model. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Favorable dosing regimen. We believe our ASOs may require as few as two to three administrations per year for the CNS or the eye and will generally involve relatively low doses, which would translate to simplified use, an improved safety profile from reduced systemic exposure and lower cost of goods. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simple and scalable manufacturing. Our novel ASOs are synthesized by highly scalable, solid-phase chemical synthesis and we leverage a well-established contract manufacturing base. We believe the manufacturing requirements for our ASOs are much simpler, more scalable and more cost-effective than gene therapy and gene editing. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our approach 
 We employ a systematic and capital-efficient approach to develop ASOs for genetically defined patient populations. We rely on our proprietary database to identify novel drug targets and corroborate these findings with existing knowledge to improve our probability of success in the clinic. We believe that leveraging our proprietary database and focusing on our core competencies of target identification and clinical and regulatory execution will allow us to reduce the time, cost and risks of drug development. 
 Target identification 
 We continue to make significant investments in our infrastructure to accelerate the pace and scale of target identification. We have built a significant bioinformatics capability, which includes proprietary bioinformatics algorithms and extensive in-house expertise in whole transcriptome RNA sequencing, also referred to as RNAseq. RNAseq uses next-generation sequencing to determine the quantity and sequences of RNA in a sample. We leverage large internal datasets of RNAseq from key tissues known to be addressable with antisense, such as the CNS, eye, liver and kidney, that are purpose-built to enhance the capture of non-productive events. 
 We employ machine learning to iteratively refine our search and scoring criteria for the most addressable non-productive mRNA elements based on internal target validation and Hit identification data. Our technology is amenable to a large number of mutations and can thereby potentially provide a single-drug approach for diseases that are caused by many loss-of-function mutations in a single gene. We have identified approximately 1,200 monogenic, or single gene, diseases containing at least one NMD-inducing nonproductive event, which we believe may be amenable to TANGO. We believe our approach is highly predictive and enables rapid and systematic identification of those targets that are most likely to have clinical relevance, thereby increasing the probability for clinical success and accelerating the expansion of our emerging pipeline. 
 Hit identification 
 Once a TANGO target is validated in cells and tissues that are relevant to the disease, we employ highly-efficient cell lines to rapidly screen for Hit ASOs that can increase the target protein expression by specifically preventing the occurrence of the non-productive event in the target mRNA. ASO arrays utilize clinically translatable previously-validated ASO chemistries, such as 2’ methoxyethyl phosphorothioate and PMO. Hit compounds are evaluated in wild-type animal models to identify Lead ASOs that possess suitable efficacy and safety to merit preclinical development. Lead ASOs are subsequently evaluated in animal disease models or ex vivo disease model systems. 
 Lead evaluation and prioritization 
 After we have identified lead compounds, we evaluate and prioritize the advancement of new development candidates based on both program-specific and portfolio-wide considerations. Program-specific criteria include, among other relevant factors, the severity of the unmet medical need, the likelihood of therapeutic utility, the feasibility of clinical development, the costs of development and the commercial opportunity. Portfolio-wide considerations include the ability to demonstrate 
 8


technical success for our platform, thereby increasing the probability of success and learnings for subsequent programs. We believe that the learnings from our lead Dravet syndrome program will significantly reduce the uncertainty of development of subsequent programs in our pipeline, particularly those targeting the CNS. 
 Clinical trial and regulatory execution 
 We employ a multi-pronged approach to bring new treatments forward as rapidly as possible. Our approach leverages previously-validated ASO chemistry and a modality that has been successfully utilized for other diseases, to minimize potential safety concerns and development risk. In August 2020, we dosed the first patient in the MONARCH Study for our lead program in Dravet syndrome with a design and endpoints common to other recently approved antiepileptic drugs. 
 Commercialization 
 We intend to retain broad commercial rights and independently bring our therapies to patients through a lean, targeted internal commercial organization. To do this, we are focused on ensuring that we can effectively identify and access those patients who will benefit from our therapies. We target diseases in which genetic testing is routinely performed, thereby shortening the diagnostic odyssey and enabling rapid identification of patients who harbor the relevant genetic mutations. We have partnered with Invitae, a leading genetic information company, to provide genetic testing at no cost to the patient. Lastly, to maximize patient access, we aim to leverage an established network of academic and tertiary centers with extensive experience with analogous drug administration. 
 Therapeutic focus and product candidates 
 We believe our ASOs can be applied to treat a wide range of severe genetic diseases, and we have carefully designed and prioritized our pipeline strategy to maximize this opportunity. We are focused on applying the transformative potential of our platform to developing medicines for patients with diseases where the genetic abnormality is known and is found in a single gene. We therefore know for a given disease precisely which gene will need to be upregulated, thus mitigating against the uncertainty of the disease biology. We are currently focused on developing product candidates to treat autosomal dominant haploinsufficiency diseases, or disorders in which one copy of a gene is mutated and results in approximately 50% of normal protein expression. Within haploinsufficiencies, we believe that no other disease area holds as clear a need or as much promise for near-term medical breakthrough as genetic epilepsies, including Dravet syndrome, and therefore we are prioritizing this disease area for our near-term development efforts. 
 Genetic epilepsies 
 Epilepsy is defined as recurrent, unprovoked seizures due to abnormal, asynchronized neuronal firing in the brain. Epilepsy is the fourth most common neurologic disease and affects more than 50 million people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization as of 2019. Epilepsy is the most frequent serious chronic neurologic condition in childhood, and approximately one out of 150 children are diagnosed with epilepsy during the first 10 years of life, with the highest incidence rate observed during infancy, according to a 2017 publication in Pediatrics. 
 More than 30% of patients with epilepsy are refractory to medical treatment, especially those with a genetic epilepsy, despite the availability of approximately 20 antiepileptic drugs. This is largely because existing antiepileptic drugs primarily address the frequency of seizures and lack the capacity to rectify the underlying neuropathological processes or genetic defect. Refractory epilepsy carries the risks of structural damage to the brain and nervous system and increased risk of premature death (e.g. from sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, or SUDEP, suicide, accidents, pneumonia, or vascular disease), as well as psychological, educational, social and vocational consequences. In addition, up to 50% of patients with epilepsy have significant cognitive delay, according to a 2015 review article in Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives. Cognitive and behavioral comorbidities are especially common in children with refractory epilepsy. Overall outcomes in patients with epilepsy have not improved significantly over the past two decades, and a novel therapeutic approach is desperately needed to modify the development or progression of the disease and improve long-term outcomes. 
 A 2010 publication in Nature Reviews Neurology estimates that more than 50% of epilepsies are now recognized as having a genetic basis, and many of these are haploinsufficiencies. The genetic bases of both rare and common epilepsies are rapidly being elucidated, and neurologists now routinely include genetic testing for more than 180 disease-associated genes in the diagnostic work-up of epilepsy. Beyond diagnostics, a major goal of genetic testing is to enable individualized treatment choices based on the genetic cause of disease. Today, the application of genetic diagnosis for epilepsy patients is largely limited to medical contraindications, such as avoidance or removal of ion channel blockers for an ion channel deficiency, given that there are no genetically-targeted medicines available for genetic epilepsy patients.

Several hundred epilepsy-related genes have been identified to date, including genes encoding neuronal ion channels and receptors and genes involved in cellular signaling. For example, the number of genes included on the epilepsy panel of Invitae Corporation, a leading genetic information company, has grown from 103 in 2015 to greater than 300 in 2020. Globally, advances in molecular technology are expected to result in discoveries of additional genetic etiologies of epilepsy, implying a greater role than ever before for genetics in the epilepsy clinic. The table below lists select genes that are commonly mutated amongst patients with epilepsy and we believe are amenable to TANGO, with current estimates of their prevalence. We continue to evaluate these CNS targets.
 
 
Gene | Disease | Estimated worldwide prevalence
--------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------
SCN1A | Dravet Syndrome | 5-5.5 in 100,000 
TSC2 | Tuberous Sclerosis 2 | 7-8 in 100,000 
MECP2 | Rett Syndrome | 5 in 100,000 
TSC1 | Tuberous Sclerosis 1 | 2-3 in 100,000 
SCN2A | Epileptic Encephalopathy | 1-2 in 100,000 
CHD2 | CHD2-Myoclonic Epilepsy | 1-2 in 100,000 
SYNGAP1 | Autosomal Dominant Mental Retardation 5 | 1 in 100,000 
SLC6A1 | Epileptic Encephalopathy | 1 in 100,000 
SCN8A | Epileptic Encephalopathy | 1 in 100,000 
CACNA1A | Episodic Ataxia, Type 2 | <1 in 100,000 

 
For some genes, the phenotypic spectrum expands beyond the epilepsies to other neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and intellectual disability. For example, although most patients with mutations in STXBP1, SYNGAP1 or CHD2 present with seizures, mutations in these genes have also been identified in individuals with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder, but without epilepsy. These neurodevelopmental disorders are not addressed with existing antiepileptic drugs. 
 Dravet syndrome disease overview 
 Dravet syndrome is one of the most severe genetic epilepsies and affects approximately 6.4 in 100,000 people worldwide, including 5-5.5 in 100,000 people who possess a mutation in the SCN1A gene, according to a 2018 market research report commissioned by us and prepared by Health Advances, LLC, or the Health Advances Report. The disease is caused by a pathogenic mutation or deletion of the SCN1A gene in approximately 85% of patients. At least 1,700 different de novo mutations in the SCN1A gene have been identified to date in Dravet syndrome patients, including single nucleotide substitutions, small insertions or deletions and even whole gene deletions. SCN1A codes for the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel, or Nav1.1 protein, an ion channel that is essential for the generation and propagation of action potentials. More than 95% of the disease-causing mutations of SCN1A cause loss-of-function, resulting in haploinsufficiency (approximately 50% reduction) of the Nav1.1 protein in select neurons in the brain. This loss of Nav1.1 channels in inhibitory interneurons and other nerve cells results in Dravet syndrome. 
 Dravet syndrome is characterized by multiple seizure types and may progress to status epilepticus or prolonged seizures lasting more than five minutes that require immediate intervention. Patients typically experience their first seizure before 12 months of age. More than 90% of patients suffer from at least one non-seizure comorbidity, including severe intellectual and developmental disabilities, motor and speech impairment, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and behavioral difficulties. Neurologic function and cognition are usually normal in children with Dravet syndrome up to two years of age. However, nearly all Dravet syndrome patients exhibit intellectual impairment by the age of four, ranging from minor learning difficulty to global developmental delay. The time between one year and eight years of age is a critical period for intervention. After eight years of age, nearly all Dravet syndrome patients exhibit evidence of substantial developmental delay. The symptoms of the disease result in remarkably low quality of life and shortened life expectancy, and as a result impose an immense burden on individuals and families. 
 The cognitive impairment in Dravet syndrome is not purely a consequence of seizures. Patients with few seizures have been observed to possess severe encephalopathy, and conversely patients with frequent seizures have been observed to exhibit relatively minimal cognitive decline. In addition, there does not appear to be a correlation between cognitive outcome and SCN1A mutation type, whether a missense or truncating mutation. 
 Importantly, patients with Dravet syndrome have an increased risk of premature death, primarily due to SUDEP. Dravet syndrome patients have the highest SUDEP rate of any epilepsy. An analysis of mortality in the Epilepsy Genetics Research Program demonstrated a Dravet syndrome-specific mortality rate of 15.84 per 1,000 patient years. SUDEP was the 
 10


most common cause of premature death among Dravet syndrome patients (59%), equating to a Dravet syndrome-specific SUDEP rate of 9.32 per 1,000 patient-years. This is nearly twice the rate for adults with refractory epilepsy. 
 Patients with Dravet syndrome are often diagnosed by three years of age, and neither patient gender nor family history of seizures is associated with risk of Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome occurs worldwide and is not concentrated in any particular geographic area or ethnic group. Early diagnosis is driven by heightened awareness of Dravet syndrome and other genetic epilepsy disorders as well as an emerging consensus amongst epilepsy specialists that early diagnosis is cost-effective and beneficial for prognosis. Among pediatric Dravet syndrome patients, approximately 90% in North America and Europe undergo genetic testing as part of their diagnostic work-up, according to a 2021 market research report commissioned by Stoke and prepared by Recon Strategy, or the Recon Strategy report. 
 The incidence of Dravet syndrome is approximately 64 per million births, which translates to an overall prevalence of approximately 35,000 patients across the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, with approximately 16,000 patients in the United States. 
 Current treatments 
 Current treatments for Dravet syndrome only address the occurrence of seizures, not the underlying cause, and according to a 2017 study as published in the Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology Journal, more than 90% of Dravet syndrome patients still report suffering from incomplete seizure control with existing antiepileptic regimens. As a result, the current treatment strategy involves the use of multiple antiepileptic drugs, including combinations of cannabidiol, stiripentol, clobazam, valproate, topiramate and others. Patients are typically treated with two to four drugs administered concomitantly, and in most cases the relief provided by polytherapy is insufficient. 
 Cannabidiol (Epidiolex), fenfluramine (Fintepla) and stiripentol (Diacomit) are currently the only FDA-approved antiepileptic drugs for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. Epidiolex was approved in 2018 for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older. Diacomit was approved in 2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older taking clobazam. There are no clinical data to support the use of Diacomit as monotherapy in Dravet syndrome. These therapies were approved based on a demonstrated reduction in seizure frequency; however, very few patients had complete control of seizure activity. For patients treated with Epidiolex, only 6.7% reported no convulsive seizures during the treatment period, according to clinical trial data in the drug’s prescribing information. Tolerance, or a significant diminishment of efficacy over time, is also observed in approximately 25% of patients, thereby limiting the usefulness of this treatment in the long-term clinical management of patients with Dravet syndrome. Additionally, cannabinoids as a drug class have been associated with adverse effects on cognitive development in children.  Fintepla is an antiepileptic drug approved in the U.S. in 2020 for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older with Dravet syndrome; however, as with Epidiolex and Diacomit, seizure-free rates remain in the low single digits. None of these approved medicines address the significant non-seizure comorbidities. Moreover, patients are still likely to be affected by non-seizure comorbidities and may develop tolerance to the drugs over time. 
 Many of the antiepileptic drugs that are used to treat Dravet syndrome can carry a substantial adverse event burden. Some of the adverse events can cause deleterious effects on cognition and lead to sedation, somnolence, inattention and fatigue, and potentially lead to death. These adverse effects may exacerbate the underlying cognitive deficits that are part of the natural course of Dravet syndrome. Patients often require regular office visits and laboratory testing to monitor toxicity to vital organ systems, especially the liver, which may be further compounded by polytherapy and associated drug-drug interactions. Despite these risks, the continued use of these medications demonstrates the importance of reducing the frequency of seizures to the patients, caregivers and the prescribing neurologists. 
 Patients with Dravet syndrome need a novel therapeutic that addresses the genetic basis of the disease and treats the large number of seizures and multiple seizure types that persist despite treatment with existing therapy. Importantly, additional therapy options are needed to address the disabling comorbidities that occur with Dravet syndrome. If STK-001 is approved by the FDA, we believe our precision medicine approach may have a profound impact on individuals and families. 
 STK-001: Product candidate 
 We believe that STK-001 has the potential to be the first disease-modifying therapy to address the genetic cause of Dravet syndrome by restoring physiological Nav1.1 levels and reducing both occurrence of seizures and significant non-seizure comorbidities. 
 11


STK-001: Preclinical data 
 We have generated compelling preclinical data that demonstrates proof-of-mechanism for STK-001. Our initial target engagement, pharmacology and efficacy studies were performed in mice, including both wild-type and a Dravet syndrome mouse model. The Dravet syndrome mouse model replicates many of the symptoms of Dravet syndrome patients, and the targeted non-productive splicing event in SCN1A is highly conserved across multiple species, including mouse, non-human primates and humans. The target sequence for STK-001 is also identical across species. 
 In wild-type mice, we characterized target engagement and pharmacology of STK-001. Five groups of neonate (postnatal day two) mice were administered a single injection dose of 0 (n=5), 0.3, (n=5) 1.0 (n=6) 3.0 (n=3) and 10.0 (n=5) µg of STK-001 by intracerebroventricular injection and returned to the home cage for five days. Sections of the brain were processed for RNA and protein. We observed that treatment with STK-001 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of non-productive mRNA. Furthermore, the reduction of non-productive mRNA was associated with an increase of productive mRNA and an increase in Nav1.1 protein, as denoted in the figures below. 
 
 
We also evaluated STK-001 pharmacology and efficacy in transgenic mice with a heterozygous deletion of Scn1a. This model was created by introducing a targeted deletion in the first coding exon of the Scn1a gene; these mice exhibit many aspects of the Dravet syndrome phenotype including seizures and premature lethality. 
 12


Neonate (postnatal day two) Dravet syndrome mice and wild-type littermate controls were administered a single dose of either placebo (consisting of a phosphate-buffered solution), or 20 µg of STK-001 (n=~50/group) by intracerebroventricular injection. Animals from each group were monitored through day 90. Brains were collected from cohorts of these animals at approximately 7 weeks after dosing (placebo: n=11 wild-type mice, n=4 Dravet syndrome mice; STK-001: n=9 wild-type mice, n=10 Dravet syndrome mice) and 14 weeks after dosing (placebo: n=10 wild-type mice, n=10 Dravet syndrome mice; STK-001: n=10 wild-type mice, n=10 Dravet syndrome mice). Notably, a single injection of STK-001 restored Nav1.1 protein in Dravet syndrome mice to levels that are near those of the wild-type mice at both 7 and 14 weeks. These data demonstrate that STK-001 has an impact on Nav1.1 protein expression and we believe this may translate to a favorable dosing regimen in humans. 
 

In addition to an increase in the Na v1.1 protein, the administration of a single dose of 20 µg of STK-001 in neonate Dravet syndrome mice (postnatal day two) resulted in a significant reduction in premature mortality. Treatment with STK-001 resulted in 97% survival of Dravet syndrome mice for the 90-day post-natal observation period (survival of 33 out of 34 mice was observed in the STK-001 Dravet syndrome mouse group) compared with 23% survival of placebo-treated mice (survival of 14 out of 62 mice). This is illustrated in the figure below. 
 

13


In additional studies, Dravet syndrome mice were treated closer to symptom onset (postnatal day 14). An interim analysis through postnatal day 35 indicated a significant reduction in premature mortality. Treatment with a single dose of 60 µg of STK-001 resulted in 98% survival of Dravet syndrome mice for the 35-day post-natal observation period (survival of 45 out of 46 mice was observed in the STK-001 Dravet syndrome mouse group) compared with 71% survival of placebo mice (survival of 32 out of 45 mice). This is illustrated in the figure below. 
 

Further preclinical studies of STK-001 have shown significant reductions in seizure frequency in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome (DS). Data from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings showed 76% (16/21) of DS mice treated with STK-001 were seizure free compared to 48% (10/21) that were treated with a placebo. An 80% reduction in the average number of spontaneous seizures (3 seizures vs 16 seizures) was also observed among treated DS mice compared to placebo. EEG is a highly sensitive measure of seizure activity, which enables the detection of seizures that may not be otherwise visible. These data are published in Han et al., Science Trans. Med, 2020.
 
Analyses were also performed in silico to understand the specificity of STK-001. We evaluated STK-001 via bioinformatic analysis against all annotated protein-coding genes to predict potential off-target activities. Results showed no perfect 18- to 16-nucleotide match for STK-001 anywhere in the transcriptome other than SCN1A pre-mRNA, indicating that STK-001 recognizes a unique sequence in the human transcriptome and should possess minimal off-target bindings. 
 14


Further supporting our specificity analysis, we also evaluated brain samples of wild-type neonate mice to ensure that STK-001 does not alter levels of other channels in the highly homologous SCN family. Importantly, the mRNA levels of closely related ion channels were not altered in the mouse brain five days after administration of 10 µg of STK-001 (n=2/group placebo, n=4/group STK-001), as shown in the figure below. Similar analysis was performed in wild-type and Dravet syndrome mice treated with 20 µg of STK-001 at 7 and 14 weeks after dosing. STK-001 treated samples showed an increase in expression of the SCN1A gene, but not any of the other SCN family members. These biological studies demonstrate that STK-001 is highly specific for SCN1A among the highly homologous family of sodium channel genes, limiting the likelihood of off-target activities. 
 

We also investigated the pharmacology, distribution and tolerability of STK-001 in a study with cynomolgus monkeys. As a pilot experiment, this study was not required to be performed under Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP. Pre-pubescent monkeys (age 2-2.5 years old) were administered a single dose of STK-001 (n=3/group; 4 groups dosed) or control solution (n=2/group; 2 groups dosed) by intrathecal injection at a dose range that we believe coincides with the estimated therapeutic dose range and stays below the maximum tolerated dose based on tolerability in mice and published data for molecules of similar chemistry. The animals were sacrificed at 3 days (n=8) and 29 days (n=8) after dosing. An increase in NaV1.1 levels was observed ranging from 1.1-fold to 2.0-fold, compared to the control group, varying by the anatomical region, dose and day of necropsy, with the greatest changes observed in the cerebral cortex. The increase in Nav1.1 was also correlated with the presence of STK-001 in brain tissue. Additionally, all doses tested showed no drug-related toxicities, including no changes in platelet counts or hepatic function, no clinical signs or symptoms over the 28-day period after administration and no abnormal histopathology. These data were presented at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in Baltimore in December 2019.
 Single dose GLP toxicology studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, that characterized the pharmacology, exposure and tolerability of STK-001 were included in the IND that was submitted to the FDA in late 2019. These studies provided data to support the initiation of the Phase 1/2a single ascending dose clinical study. 
 Dravet syndrome clinical program—STK-001 
 We designed our lead product candidate, STK-001, to treat Dravet syndrome, a severe and progressive genetic epilepsy. This program draws on a well-defined patient population based on routine genetic testing and learnings from drugs approved for the treatment of Dravet syndrome to inform the clinical and regulatory pathways for STK-001. 
 We submitted an investigational new drug application (“IND”) for STK-001 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in late 2019. In August 2020, we dosed the first patient with STK-001 in the single ascending dose portion of the MONARCH Phase 1/2a Study at the 10mg dose level.
 The MONARCH Study is designed to evaluate single and multiple ascending dose levels of STK-001 in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome. Patients are eligible for the trial if they are between the ages of 2 to 18, have an established diagnosis of Dravet syndrome and have evidence of a pathogenic genetic mutation in the SCN1A gene. Requiring an SCN1A mutation (of which more than 1,700 SCN1A mutations have been identified) for trial enrollment allows for a clear and definitive etiologic diagnosis, a more homogeneous patient population and tailored treatment based on a precision medicine approach. Eligible patients will also have failed at least two epilepsy treatments in the past and currently be taking at least one antiepileptic drug. All medications and interventions will remain unchanged throughout the trial, which will allow for assessment of STK-001 with a variety of antiepileptic therapies. 
 15


The primary objectives are the assessment of the safety and tolerability of STK-001, as well as to characterize human pharmacokinetics. A secondary objective is to assess the efficacy as an adjunctive antiepileptic treatment with respect to the percentage change from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency over a 12-week treatment period. We are measuring non-seizure aspects of the disease, such as quality of life as secondary endpoints. These endpoints as well as other exploratory endpoints will be informed based on our two-year observational study (BUTTERFLY). Enrollment in BUTTERFLY is complete and the study is ongoing. BUTTERFLY is designed to evaluate seizure frequency and non-seizure comorbidities associated with the disease, including motor and speech impairment, intellectual and developmental disabilities, behavioral deficits and abnormal sleep patterns. Data from the study will support clinical development plans for STK-001.  
 In March 2020, we announced the FDA had placed a partial clinical hold on doses of STK-001 above 20mg in the MONARCH Study, pending additional preclinical testing to determine the safety profile of doses higher than the current no observed adverse effect level (“NOAEL”). When intrathecal doses above the NOAEL were administered to non-human primates (“NHPs”) adverse hind limb paresis was observed. This finding is known to occur following intrathecal delivery of ASOs to NHPs and is not known to translate to the human experience. When extremely high dose levels were administered, acute convulsions were observed immediately following STK-001 administration. The dose levels were well above the range of corresponding human doses that would ever be administered in the clinic and were delivered in a formulation that was at a higher concentration than would be administered in the clinic. There is no apparent correlation of these acute adverse events with the mechanism of action of STK-001. 
 Following interactions with the FDA, in October 2020, we announced that the FDA agreed to allow us to add an additional higher dose level to the SAD portion of the study such that a total of three dose levels will be evaluated: 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30mg. Dosing above 30mg in this study remains on FDA partial clinical hold. 
 In addition, a multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) portion was added to the MONARCH Study based on preclinical repeat-dose toxicology data, which were reviewed by the FDA. There were no adverse effects observed in the NHP repeat dose study. 
 Enrollment and dosing in the first two cohorts (10mg and 20mg) of the single ascending dose portion of the study are now complete. Enrollment and dosing of patients in the 30mg single ascending dose cohort is now underway. In February 2021, the first patient in the MAD portion of the study was dosed with STK-001 at the 20mg level. We expect to announce initial safety and pharmacokinetic data from the SAD portion of the MONARCH Study in the second half of 2021. 
 In January 2021, we initiated enrollment and dosing in our SWALLOWTAIL Open Label Extension (OLE) study of STK-001 for children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome. SWALLOWTAIL is designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of repeated doses of STK-001 in patients with Dravet syndrome who previously participated in studies of STK-001. In this study, patients will initially be administered the same dose level they received in the previous study and will receive a maximum of three doses. One dose will be administered every four months.
 While we continue working to minimize any potential delay to continued clinical testing of STK-001, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic may directly or indirectly impact the timeline. Our ability to continue the clinical trial or initiate the MAD portion of the clinical trial may be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, although our Phase 1/2a study of STK-001 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome has not been delayed, we plan to have clinical trial sites in various parts of the United States, some of which have had high incident rates of COVID-19 patients. Restrictions on travel and/or transport of clinical materials, as well as diversion of hospital staff and resources to COVID-19 infected patients, could disrupt trial operations as well as recruitment, possibly resulting in a slowdown in enrollment and/or deviations from or disruptions in key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring. These challenges may lead to difficulties in meeting protocol-specified procedures. 
 We have not yet discussed with regulatory authorities the evidence necessary for approval of STK-001. However, in addition to requesting Fast Track Designation, if we see evidence of clinical efficacy, then we would plan to meet with regulatory authorities to discuss expedited regulatory pathways. 
 Program update 
 Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy program 
 In November 2020, we announced the nomination of OPA1 as our next target for preclinical development to treat Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy (“ADOA”). ADOA is the most common inherited optic nerve disorder seen in clinical practice and causes progressive and irreversible vision loss in both eyes starting in the first decade of life. Many children progress to blindness. Roughly half of people with ADOA fail driving standards and up to 46% are registered as legally blind. The disease affects one in 30,000 people globally with a higher incidence of approximately one in 10,000 in Denmark due to a founder effect. 65% to 90% of ADOA is caused by mutations in one allele of the OPA1 gene, most of which lead to 
 16


haploinsufficiency and disease manifestation. More than 400 different OPA1 mutations have been reported in people diagnosed with ADOA. Most mutations result in a severe decrease – up to 50% – of the normal amount of the OPA1 protein. There is no strong genotype-phenotype correlation. 
 OPA1 is a dynamin-related GTPase that plays a key role in maintaining mitochondria structure and dynamics. The OPA1 protein is imported into the mitochondria and is the crucial molecule that mediates inner mitochondria membrane fusion and cristae morphogenesis and is critical for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis. Insufficient OPA1 activity causes mitochondria dysfunction with consequent insufficient ATP production, excess reactive oxygen species production and eventual cell death. High energy demanding cells such as neurons and cardiomyocytes are particularly susceptible to mitochondria dysfunction, and retinal ganglion cells (“RGCs”) are a neuronal cell type most susceptible to loss of OPA1 protein as evidenced by RGC death in ADOA caused by OPA1 haploinsufficiency. 
 A clinical diagnosis of ADOA is made when a patient meets some or all of the following criteria: pathogenic variant of the OPA1 gene identified in the patient or a family member; reduced visual acuity; temporal disc pallor; visual field defect; color vision defect (acquired blue-yellow loss); thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer and abnormal visual evoked potentials. Clinical findings are based on: intraocular pressure measurement; visual field assessment; color discrimination; dilated slit lamp biomicroscopy; optical coherence tomography; or visual electrophysiology. Patients suspected of ADOA are recommended to receive genetic testing to confirm the clinical diagnosis, help identify other family members who are affected and ensure patients avoid stressors that could increase disease progression (e.g. smoking, alcohol). The prognosis for many patients with ADOA is poor and the rate of visual loss can be difficult to predict given significant inter- and intra-familial variability. 
 There are currently no available treatments for ADOA. Because ADOA causes deterioration of the optic nerves, corrective aids such as glasses or contacts do not help to improve vision lost to the disease. Supportive services and low-vision aids are offered for patients with severely decreased visual acuity. Our ASOs are designed to target the underlying cause of ADOA, which is OPA1 haploinsufficiency, by decreasing a non-productive mRNA splicing event in the OPA1 gene to increase productive OPA1 mRNA and OPA1 protein in the retinal ganglion cells. 
 OPA1 preclinical data for the potential treatment of ADOA 
 We previously identified a novel exon inclusion event (“Exon X”) in OPA1 that leads to non-productive mRNA due to introduction of a premature termination codon (“PTC”) (Figure 1 below). In April 2020 and June 2020, we provided data in presentations at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology meetings, respectively, showing that ASO-14 blocked the incorporation of Exon X with consequent dose-dependent increase in productive OPA1 mRNA and protein due to reduction of Exon X-directed non-sense mediated decay (“NMD”) of OPA1 mRNA (Figure 2 below). We have now demonstrated that a single injection of ASO-14 surrogate in the rabbit eye leads to a dose-dependent increase in ASO accumulation in the retina that correlated with an increase in target engagement (removal of Exon X) and an increase in OPA1 protein (Figure 3 below). The study was conducted using female NZW rabbits that were injected with a single dose of vehicle alone or vehicle containing ASO (n=3/group). On Days 15 and 29, the retinal tissue was collected and analyzed. Specifically, we learned that retinal exposure of ASO-14 surrogate (ST-1102) was elevated with increased dosing, dose-dependent target engagement was seen at all three time-points examined, and protein increase of OPA1 protein was observed at both Day 15 and Day 29 of the study. We further showed that in OPA1 haploinsufficient human cells, ASO-14-mediated increase in OPA1 protein translates to improved mitochondrial function as measured by the substantial restoration of Adenosine triphosphate (“ATP”) levels in the treated cells (Figure 4 below). ATP is produced by the mitochondria and is the key energy carrying molecule in cells. We observed a 20% ATP deficit in OPA1 +/- HEK293. Treatment with ASO-14 restored ATP levels to ~90% of control cells.

 We believe our preclinical data to date support the use of our TANGO technology to treat ADOA due to OPA1 haploinsufficiency. We have observed that ASO-mediated specific reduction in non-productive OPA1 mRNA provides an increase in productive OPA1 mRNA and an increase in OPA1 protein in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. We have also observed dose-dependent ASO exposure and consequent reduction in non-productive mRNA and increase in OPA1 protein in vivo in the rabbit retina. Test compounds were well-tolerated in wild-type rabbit for up to 29 days after intravitreal injection (maximum days evaluated). ASO-mediated increase in OPA1 protein levels in OPA1 haploinsufficient cells correlated with a substantial restoration of mitochondrial function as measured by an increase in ATP synthesis capability.  The TANGO approach utilizes the wild-type OPA1 allele and can potentially be used to treat ADOA due to loss of OPA1 activity in a mutation-independent manner. As with STK-001 for Dravet syndrome, our study and development of the use of our TANGO technology to treat ADOA is subject to the risks and uncertainties stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, which may directly or indirectly impact our ability to pursue this new target, and the timing in which we do so.
 Additional product opportunities 
 We are also advancing additional programs focused on multiple targets, including haploinsufficiency diseases of the CNS, eye, kidney and liver, given the ability of our ASOs to target cells in these organs. These tissues are affected in many severe genetic diseases. 
 Longer-term, we believe that ASOs designed using TANGO may have the potential to upregulate non-mutated genes in biological pathways to treat diseases or conditions caused by multiple genes or are multifactorial, such as autoimmune diseases, aging and cancer. For these diseases, we intend to opportunistically secure partnerships with pharma partners whose scientific, development or commercial capabilities complement our own.

Business Update Regarding COVID-19
 The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets.
 To date, our third party contract research organizations (“CROs”), contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”), and other third party vendors have been able to continue to provide services and supply reagents, materials, and products and currently do not anticipate any significant disruption in services or interruptions in supply. We have pursued mitigation strategies to keep key research activities on track. Our third-party CMOs continue to operate their manufacturing facilities at or near normal levels. While we currently do not anticipate any significant interruptions in our manufacturing processes, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic and response efforts may have an impact in the future on our third-party suppliers and CMOs ability to manufacture reagents, materials, or products that we need to use in our research and clinical trial. However, we are continuing to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, including our expenses, our observational study, our clinical trial, and our ability to hire and retain employees. 
 Our ability to continue our observational study may be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently we are monitoring patients in our observational study, including the duration and degree to which we may see delays in conducting in-person follow-ups, and disruptions in our ability to monitor patients due to hospitals closing sites or diverting the resources that are necessary to conduct our observational study.  
 While we continue to enroll and dose patients in our Phase 1/2a clinical trial at sites across the United States, we expect that COVID-19 precautions may directly or indirectly impact the timeline for some of our clinical trial activities due to hospitals closing sites and/or diverting the resources that are necessary to conduct clinical trials. We are pursuing approaches to help mitigate the impact to our clinical trial. Currently we have not experienced any delay in initiating our clinical trial.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices (including but not limited to curtailing or modifying employee travel, moving to partial remote work, and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, patients and business partners. 
 Our office-based employees have been working from home since early March 2020, while ensuring essential staffing levels in our operations remain in place, including maintaining key personnel in our laboratories. 
 Manufacturing 
 We currently contract with third parties to manufacture our products undergoing late-preclinical testing and anticipate using third parties for all clinical and commercial manufacturing. We do not own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution, or testing. We have personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience and good project management to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities. We will continue to expand and strengthen our network of third-party providers but may also consider investing in additional internal manufacturing capabilities in the future if there is a technical need, or a strategic or financial benefit. 
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose procedural and documentation requirements. At a minimum these regulations govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance. Our systems, procedures and contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations and are assessed through regular monitoring and formal audits. 
 Drug substance 
 Oligonucleotide drug substance requirements for our most advanced programs can be readily met by a variety of domestic and international contractors. Many of these contractors are also able to source all the required raw materials, which allows us to consolidate raw material procurement and drug substance manufacturing activities with a single supplier. To ensure supply chain continuity, we plan to establish supply agreements with alternative suppliers as appropriate. As part of each development program, efforts will be made to invest in process changes to improve purity and yield as warranted. 
 21


Future drug substance compositions may require different manufacturing capabilities, which will be addressed through either expanded capability with existing contractors or establishing manufacturing supply relationships with new contractors. These changes in composition may also require new supply chain agreements with contractors that specialize in raw material manufacturing. Our internal personnel will work to identify and establish relationships with contractors that may be ideally suited to meeting these new manufacturing requirements. 
 Drug product 
 In the near future, we expect all our oligonucleotide drug products to consist of drug substance formulated in either saline, buffered saline, or some other diluent appropriate for intrathecal, intraocular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection. These types of formulations can be manufactured using common processes and readily available materials. We are establishing agreements with a variety of contractors that are suitably equipped to manufacture, package, and test these types of oligonucleotide drug product formulations for subsequent shipment to clinical sites. Several of these manufacturers would also be capable of formulation and packaging for commercial use. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, and the genetic medicines fields, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge in the field of biologics, RNA splicing, and antisense oligonucleotide chemistry provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions that conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. 
 While therapeutic modalities, including gene therapy, gene editing, modified RNA and protein-based drugs, are currently being developed to address monogenic diseases, most of these approaches are focused on autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant gain-of-function diseases. The nature and fundamental limitations of these approaches make them less suited for addressing the underlying cause of autosomal dominant haploinsufficiencies. Other next generation antisense oligonucleotides have also generally had limited success in upregulating gene expression of haploinsufficiencies, due to a focus on indirectly and weakly validated mechanisms of action such as targeting microRNAs or long non-coding RNAs that are associated with a gene transcript. We are pioneers in developing disease-modifying therapies to treat haploinsufficiencies and are uniquely positioned to exploit this significant opportunity with our TANGO platform. 
 If our current product candidate, STK-001, is approved for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, it may compete with other products currently marketed or in development. Currently marketed antiepileptic drugs range from cannabidiols, such as GW Pharmaceuticals, plc’s Epidiolex, Fintepla® (fenfluramine) from Zogenix, to GABA receptor agonists, such as clobazam, to glutamate blockers, such as topiramate. Companies such as Ovid Therapeutics/Takeda, Xenon Pharmaceuticals, and Encoded Therapeutics are also developing treatments for Dravet syndrome. Many of the currently marketed antiepileptic drugs are available as generics. In addition, numerous compounds are in clinical development for treatment of epilepsy. To our knowledge, the clinical development pipeline includes cannabinoids, 5-HT release stimulants, cholesterol 24-hydroxylase inhibitors, and sodium channel antagonists from a variety of companies. Importantly, we believe none of the drugs in clinical development address the underlying genetic cause of Dravet syndrome. 
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a 
 22


strong market position in advance of the entry of our products. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of other drugs. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and availability of reimbursement. 
 Reimbursement 
 The regulations that govern pricing and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription biopharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, a drug company can obtain regulatory approval for a product in a country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of that product. 
 A drug company’s ability to commercialize any products successfully will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Even if one or more products are successfully brought to the market, these products may not be considered cost effective, and the amount reimbursed for such products may be insufficient to allow them to be sold on a competitive basis. Third-party payors who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, such as government plans, are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are seeking to reduce the prices charged or the amounts reimbursed for biopharmaceutical products. 
 Significant delays can occur in obtaining reimbursement for newly-approved drugs or therapeutic biologics, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug or therapeutic biologic is approved by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers a drug company’s costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. 
 Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also be insufficient to cover a drug company’s costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may be based on payments allowed for lower cost drugs or therapeutic biologics that are already reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other services and may reflect budgetary constraints or imperfections in Medicare data. Net prices for drugs or therapeutic biologics may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs or therapeutic biologics from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
 Intellectual property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including obtaining, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among, other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio, including in-licensed patents and patent applications, is intended to cover, but is not limited to, our technology platforms, product candidates and components thereof, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, platforms and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our position in our TANGO platform and product candidates. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned or controlled by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; to defend against challenges and assertions by third parties of their purported intellectual property rights; and to operate without infringement of valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. 
 
With respect to our TANGO platform, we have exclusively licensed intellectual property for our TANGO technology from the University of Southampton and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, which includes issued U.S. patents and pending 
 23


U.S. and foreign patent applications that cover the TANGO mechanisms. As of December 31, 2020, the issued U.S. patents, pending U.S. patent applications and pending foreign patent applications that we have licensed from the University of Southampton are anticipated to expire between 2035 and 2036, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2020, the issued U.S. patents, pending U.S. patent applications and pending foreign patent applications that we have licensed from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory are anticipated to expire in 2035, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
Separately, we have filed patent applications with claims that are intended to cover compositions of matter of oligonucleotides designed to target specific elements in genes for more than 140 genetic diseases that we believe are amenable to upregulation of target protein expression using our TANGO platform. As of December 31, 2020, any patents that may issue from these currently pending patent applications, including PCT international applications, U.S. patent applications, and foreign patent applications, are expected to expire between 2036 and 2041, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 With respect to STK-001, as of December 31, 2020, we have exclusively licensed a U.S. patent and a pending U.S. patent application that cover the mechanism of action of STK-001, as well as pending foreign patent applications. The issued patent and any patents that may issue from these pending patent applications are expected to expire between 2035 and 2036, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2020, we also own a U.S. patent, pending U.S. patent applications, PCT international applications and pending foreign patent applications relating to STK-001, and the U.S. patent any patents that may issue from these pending patent applications are expected to expire between 2038 and 2040, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. However, the term of United States patents may be extended for delays incurred due to compliance with the FDA requirements or by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO. For example, for drugs that are regulated by the FDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act, it is permitted to extend the term of a patent that covers such drug for up to five years beyond the normal expiration date of the patent. For more information on patent term extensions, see “Business—Government regulation: The Hatch-Waxman Act—Patent term extension”. In the future, if and when our biopharmaceutical product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those product candidates. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO and FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. Our currently issued patents will likely expire on dates ranging from 2035 to 2038, unless we receive patent term extension or patent term adjustment, or both. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2036 to 2041, unless we receive patent term extension or patent term adjustment, or both. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of genetic therapy has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in the patent laws and rules, either by legislation, judicial decisions, or regulatory interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or otherwise commercializing any of our patented inventions, either directly or indirectly, will depend in part on our success in obtaining, defending and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our platform and product candidates and the methods used to manufacture them. Moreover, our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our platform’s product candidates. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our TANGO platform and product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or invalidated, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related platforms or product candidates or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our TANGO platform and product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any 
 24


issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our TANGO platform and product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before any product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. For this and other risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates, please see the section entitled “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property.” 
 We have filed for trademark protection of the “Stoke Therapeutics” mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and foreign trademark organizations. We have registered, and intend to maintain, the trademark “Stoke Therapeutics” in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in numerous other jurisdictions, including but not limited to the European Union, China, India, and Canada.
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our confidential and proprietary information as trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements under the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In many cases our confidentiality and other agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors require them to assign or grant us licenses to inventions they invent as a result of the work or services they render under such agreements or grant us an option to negotiate a license to use such inventions. Despite these efforts, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. 
 We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in relation to the resulting know-how or inventions. For more information, please see the section entitled “Risk factors – Risks related to our intellectual property.” 
 License and research agreements 
 In July 2015, we entered into a worldwide license agreement (the “CSHL Agreement”), with CSHL, with respect to TANGO patents. The CSHL Agreement was subsequently amended in May 2019 and in July 2020. Under the CSHL Agreement, we receive an exclusive (except with respect to certain government rights and non-exclusive licenses), worldwide license under certain patents and applications relating to TANGO. As part of the CSHL Agreement, we granted CSHL 164,927 shares of common stock valued based on an independent appraisal at approximately $0.07 million. The CSHL Agreement obligates us to make additional payments that are contingent upon certain milestones being achieved. We are also required to pay royalties, tiered based on the scope of patent coverage for each licensed product, ranging from a low-single digit percentage to a mid-single digit percentage on annual net sales. These royalty obligations apply on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of a CSHL patent covering the applicable licensed product or (ii) the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity for the applicable licensed product. In addition, if we sublicense the rights under the CSHL Agreement, we are required to pay a maximum of twenty percent of the sublicense revenue to CSHL, which may be reduced to a mid-teens or a mid-single digit percentage upon achievement of certain clinical milestones for the applicable licensed product. Finally, we are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee of $0.01 million, which amount is creditable against any owed royalty or milestone payments. The maximum aggregate potential milestone payments payable total approximately $0.9 million. Additionally, certain licenses under the CSHL Agreement require us to reimburse CSHL for certain past and ongoing patent related expenses, however there were no expenses related to these reimbursable patent costs during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. 
 25


In April 2016, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with the University of Southampton, (the “Southampton Agreement”), whereby we acquired rights to foundational technologies related to our TANGO technology. Under the Southampton Agreement, we received an exclusive, worldwide license under certain licensed patents and applications relating to TANGO. As part of the Southampton Agreement, we paid 0.06 million pounds sterling (approximately $0.08 million as of the date thereof) as an up-front license fee. Under the Southampton Agreement, we may be obligated to make additional payments that are contingent upon certain milestones being achieved, as well as royalties on future product sales. These royalty obligations survive until the latest of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent covering a subject product or (ii) the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity for the subject product in a country. In addition, if we sublicense our rights under the Southampton Agreement, we are required to pay a mid-single digit percentage of the sublicense revenue to the University of Southampton. The maximum aggregate potential milestone payments payable by us totaled approximately 0.4 million pounds sterling (approximately $0.5 million as of December 31, 2020). As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we had recorded no liabilities under the Southampton Agreement. 
 Government regulation 
 FDA approval process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. regulations may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal testing followed by submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical testing may commence. Data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials are required to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 
 Preclinical requirements include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, pharmacology and toxicity studies in animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. The clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin after a safe to proceed communication is received from the FDA.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard designed to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles, qualifications and responsibilities of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested 
 26


to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug generally for a specific indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances, including (1) where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence. 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,875,842 for fiscal year 2021, and the manufacturer and sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program fees, currently exceeding $336,000 for each prescription product. These fees are typically increased annually. Sponsors of applications for drugs granted Orphan Drug Designation are exempt from these user fees. 
 FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, FDA begins an in-depth review. FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications to encourage timeliness. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months of the date of submission of the new drug application to FDA; the target review period for priority review drugs is six months from the date of filing (accepted for review by the FDA) of the new drug application. Priority review can be applied to an application for a drug that treats a serious condition and if approved would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over existing treatments or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 
 FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an external drug advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians, statisticians, patient representatives and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. 
 Before approving an NDA, FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug substance and drug product are manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. 
 After FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. 
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 27


Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 
 Fast Track Designation, Breakthrough Designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 
The following four FDA programs are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition: fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review designation. The programs are intended to help ensure that therapies for serious conditions are approved and available to patients as soon as it can be concluded that the therapies “benefits justify their risks”.
 Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. Fast Track Designation is intended to facilitate development and expedite review of drugs to treat serious and life-threatening conditions so that an approved product can reach the market expeditiously. If a submission is granted Fast Track Designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with FDA, and FDA may review sections of the NDA before the full application is complete. This rolling review is available if, in agreement with the FDA, the applicant provides, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information. However, the FDA does not start the review clock for the application until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by FDA if they believe that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging data in the development process. 
 Breakthrough therapy designation may be granted by the FDA to the development of a new drug and also for a new use or indication of an approved drug. This designation requires preliminary clinical evidence of a treatment effect that may represent substantial improvement over available therapies for the treatment of a serious condition. FDA expects that such evidence generally would be derived from early phase trials such as phase 1 or 2 trials. For purposes of breakthrough therapy designation, preliminary clinical evidence refers to evidence that is sufficient to indicate that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement in effectiveness or safety over available therapies; however, FDA recognizes that the data cannot be expected to be definitive at the time of designation. Breakthrough therapy designation facilitates Intensive Guidance from the FDA on an “Efficient Drug Development Program, Beginning as Early as Phase 1”.
 Under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval regulations, FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous and mandatory post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to priority review by FDA. 
 Orphan Drugs 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug Designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such 
 28


as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug Designation are tax credits for certain research and an exemption from the NDA application user fee. 
 Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program 
 Under the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, FDA may award a priority review voucher to the sponsor of an approved marketing application for a product that treats or prevents a rare pediatric disease. The voucher entitles the sponsor to priority review of one subsequent marketing application. 
 A voucher may be awarded only for an approved rare pediatric disease product application. A rare pediatric disease product application is an NDA or a Biologics License Application (BLA) for a product that treats or prevents a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years; in general, the disease must affect fewer than 200,000 such individuals in the U.S.; the NDA must be deemed eligible for priority review; the NDA must not seek approval for a different adult indication (i.e., for a different disease/condition); the product must not contain an active ingredient that has been previously approved by FDA; and the NDA must rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population such that the approved product can be adequately labeled for the pediatric population. Before NDA approval, FDA may designate a product in development as a product for a rare pediatric disease, but such designation is not required to receive a voucher. 
 To receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, a sponsor must notify FDA, upon submission of the NDA, of its intent to request a voucher. If FDA determines that the NDA is a rare pediatric disease product application, and if the NDA is approved, FDA will award the sponsor of the NDA a voucher upon approval of the NDA. FDA may revoke a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher if the product for which it was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within 365 days of the product’s approval. 
 
The voucher, which is transferable to another sponsor, may be submitted with a subsequent NDA or biologics license application, or BLA, and entitles the holder to priority review of the accompanying NDA or BLA. The sponsor submitting the priority review voucher must notify FDA of is intent to submit the voucher with the NDA or BLA at least 90 days prior to submission of the NDA or BLA and must pay a priority review user fee in addition to any other required user fee ($1,360,879 in fiscal year 2021). FDA must take action on an NDA or BLA under priority review within six months of receipt of the NDA or BLA. 
 The Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program was reauthorized in the 21st Century Cures Act, allowing a product that is designated as a product for a rare pediatric disease prior to October 1, 2020 to be eligible to receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher upon approval of a qualifying application prior to October 1, 2022. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. FDA also may require post-marketing testing or studies, known as Phase 4 commitments, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 29


Pediatric information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. With certain exceptions, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or nonpatent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers. 
 Disclosure of clinical trial information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act 
 Orange Book listing 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 
 Exclusivity 
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive 
 30


any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, can be the subject of a three-year period if the application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the sponsor that were essential to the approval of the application. FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change during the exclusivity period.
 Patent term extension 
 After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years). The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted. 
 Foreign regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States. 
 Other healthcare laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other healthcare laws and regulations. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. 
 Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were 
 31


used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect. 
 Further, pursuant to the ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, has issued a final rule that requires manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The first reports were due in 2014 and must be submitted on an annual basis. The reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Effective January 1, 2022, reporting on transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives will also be required. 
 In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. 
 Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.

U.S. healthcare reform
  In the United States there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of health care and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, (i) subjected therapeutic biologics to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars by creating a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products, (ii) proscribed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs and therapeutic biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, (iii) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, (iv) established annual nondeductible fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and therapeutic biologics, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs (v) established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer what are now 70% point of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs and therapeutic biologics to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs and therapeutic biologics to be covered under Medicare Part D, (vi) expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability, (vii) expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health program (viii) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research, and (ix) established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 There have been legislative and judicial efforts to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA, including measures taken during the Trump administration. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, among other things, included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. In November 2020, the United States Supreme Court held oral arguments on the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals decision that held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. It is uncertain how the United States Supreme Court will rule on this case or how healthcare measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices, and effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax.
 Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In addition, CMS published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility, effective January 1, 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group  marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted to reduce healthcare expenditures. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, which was signed into law in March 2020 and is designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the suspension of the 2% Medicare sequester through March 31, 2021. Moreover, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover 
 33


overpayments to providers from three to five years. If federal spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop. 
 Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. While the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. 
 Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included at $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug process, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower cost generic and biosimilar drugs. In particular, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. FDA also released a final rule in September 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, in November 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. The CMS also issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. In December 2020, CMS issued a final rule implementing significant manufacturer price reporting changes under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. It is unclear to what extent these new regulations will be implemented and to what extent these regulations or any future legislation or regulations by the Biden administration will have on our business, including our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA authorization under an FDA expanded access program; however, manufacturers are not obligated to provide investigational new drug products under the current federal right to try law. 
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 79 employees, 31 of whom have an M.D. or Ph.D. We have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive and cash-based performance bonus plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards
