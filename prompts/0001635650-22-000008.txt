Item 1. Business.

References to “we,” “our,” “us” or the “partnership” used in present tense for periods beginning on or after July 1, 2015, refer to Green Plains Partners LP and its subsidiaries. References to the “MLP predecessor” used in a historical context for periods ended on or before June 30, 2015, refer to BlendStar LLC and its subsidiaries, the partnership’s predecessor for accounting purposes, and the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the ethanol storage and leased railcar assets contributed by Green Plains in connection with the IPO on July 1, 2015. 

Overview

Green Plains Partners is a fee-based Delaware master limited partnership formed by our parent, Green Plains, Inc. on March 2, 2015. On July 1, 2015, we completed our IPO. Our common units are traded under the symbol “GPP” on the Nasdaq. Green Plains Partners provides fuel storage and transportation services by owning, operating, developing and acquiring ethanol and fuel storage facilities, terminals, transportation assets and other related assets and businesses. We were formed by Green Plains, a vertically integrated ethanol producer, to support its marketing and distribution activities as its primary downstream logistics provider.

We generate a substantial portion of our revenues under fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade for receiving, storing, transferring and transporting ethanol and other fuels, which are supported by minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments. We do not take ownership or receive any payments based on the value of ethanol or other fuels we handle. As a result, we do not have direct price exposure to fluctuating commodity prices.

As of December 31, 2021, our parent owns a 48.9% limited partner interest in us, consisting of 11,586,548 common units, a 2.0% general partner interest and all of our incentive distribution rights. The public owns the remaining 49.1% limited partner interest. The following diagram depicts our simplified organizational structure at December 31, 2021:
Our Assets and Operations

Ethanol Storage. Our ethanol storage assets are the principal method of storing ethanol produced at our parent’s ethanol production plants. Most of our parent’s ethanol production plants are located near major rail lines. Ethanol can be distributed from our storage facilities to bulk terminals via truck, railcar or barge. 




We currently own or lease 29 ethanol storage tanks and approximately 43 acres of land. Our storage tanks are located at or near our parent’s 11 operational ethanol production plants in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Tennessee, as well as our parent’s non-operational ethanol production plant in Virginia.

Our ethanol storage tanks have combined storage capacity of 25.9 mmg and aggregate throughput capacity sufficient to support our parent’s annual production capacity of 958 mmgy. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our parent operated its ethanol production facilities at an average utilization rate of approximately 77%. The following table presents additional ethanol production plant details by location:



Plant Location | Initial Operation or Acquisition Date | Major Rail Line Access | Plant Production Capacity (mmgy) | On-Site Ethanol Storage Capacity (thousands of gallons)
Atkinson, Nebraska | June 2013 | BNSF | | 55 | 2,074 
Central City, Nebraska | July 2009 | Union Pacific | | 116 | 2,250 
Fairmont, Minnesota | Nov. 2013 | Union Pacific | | 119 | 3,124

Total | | | | 958 | 25,905

(1) Production at the Hopewell, Virginia facility ceased during the fourth quarter of 2018; however, the storage and terminal assets remain in operating condition.

Terminal and Distribution Services. We own and operate four fuel terminals in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma with combined total storage capacity of approximately 6.9 mmg and access to major rail lines. We also own approximately five acres of land and lease approximately 16 acres of land where our fuel terminals are located. Ethanol and other products are transported to our terminals primarily by rail and shipped from our terminals by truck to third parties, including refiners, blenders and other obligated and non-obligated parties. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the aggregate throughput at these facilities was approximately 187.5 mmg. 

The following table presents additional fuel terminal details by location:


Fuel Terminal Facility Location | Major ‎Rail Line Access | On-Site Storage Capacity ‎(thousands of gallons) | Throughput Capacity (mmgy)
Birmingham, Alabama - Unit Train Terminal | BNSF | | 6,542 | 300
Other Fuel Terminal Facilities | (1) | | 330 | 264
 | | | 6,872 | 564


(1) Access to our three other fuel terminal facilities is available from BNSF, KCS, Canadian National, Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and CSX.

Transportation and Delivery. Ethanol deliveries to distant markets are shipped using major U.S. rail carriers that can switch cars to other major railroads or barge delivery to national or international ports. Our railcar volumetric capacity is used to transport product primarily from our ethanol storage facilities and third-party production facilities to fuel terminals, including our own, international export terminals and refineries located throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2021, our leased railcar fleet consisted of approximately 2,300 railcars with an aggregate capacity of 69.0 mmg. We expect our railcar volumetric capacity to fluctuate over the normal course of business as our existing railcar leases expire and we enter into or acquire new railcar leases.

We also own and operate a fleet of 19 trucks and tankers that transport ethanol and other products. 
‎

Segments 

Our operations consist of one reportable segment and are conducted solely in the U.S. See Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for financial information about our operations and assets.
Our Relationship with Green Plains

Green Plains is one of the largest ethanol producers in North America with 11 operating dry mill plants, with the capacity to produce approximately 1.0 billion gallons of ethanol per year. Our parent is transitioning from a commodity-processing business to a value-add agricultural technology company focused on creating additional diverse, non-cyclical, higher margin feed ingredients, specialty alcohols and renewable feedstocks for the emerging renewable diesel industry. 

We benefit significantly from our relationship with our parent. Our assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol our parent produces. Our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade account for a substantial portion of our revenues.

Our parent has a majority interest in us through the ownership of our general partner and a 48.9% limited partner interest, as well as all of our incentive distribution rights. We believe our parent will continue to support the successful execution of our business strategies given its significant ownership in us and the importance of our assets to Green Plains’ operations.

We have entered into several agreements with our parent, which were established in conjunction with the IPO, including: an omnibus agreement; a contribution, conveyance and assumption agreement; an operational services and secondment agreement; and various commercial agreements described below. For all material agreements and subsequent amendments required to be filed, please refer to Item 15 – Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules.

Commercial Agreements with Affiliate

A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, our primary customer, including a (1) fee-based storage and throughput agreement, (2) Birmingham terminal services agreement, (3) fee-based rail transportation services agreement and (4) various other transportation and terminal services agreements. 

Minimum Volume Commitments. Our storage and throughput agreement and certain terminal services agreements with Green Plains Trade are supported by minimum volume commitments. Our rail transportation services agreement is supported by minimum take-or-pay capacity commitments. Green Plains Trade is required to pay us fees for these minimum commitments regardless of actual throughput volume, capacity used, or the amount of product tendered for transport, which is intended to provide some assurance that we will receive a certain amount of revenue during the terms of these agreements. These arrangements are intended to provide stable and predictable cash flows over time.

Storage and Throughput Agreement. Under our storage and throughput agreement, as amended, Green Plains Trade is obligated to deliver a minimum volume of 217.7 mmg of product per calendar quarter at our storage facilities and pay $0.05312 per gallon on all throughput volume. The rate increased on July 1, 2020 from $0.05 per gallon to $0.05312 per gallon in accordance with the terms of the agreement. If Green Plains Trade fails to meet its minimum volume commitment during any quarter, we charge Green Plains Trade a deficiency payment equal to the deficient volume multiplied by the applicable fee. The deficiency payments are applied as a credit toward volumes delivered by Green Plains Trade in excess of the minimum volume commitment during the following four quarters, after which time any unused credits will expire.

In conjunction with the disposition of the Ord storage and railcar assets on March 22, 2021, the minimum volume commitment decreased from 232.5 mmg per calendar quarter to 217.7 mmg per calendar quarter. In addition, the storage and throughput agreement with Green Plains Trade was extended an additional year to June 30, 2029, as part of this transaction.

The storage and throughput agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 360 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term. 


Terminal Services Agreement. Under our terminal services agreement for the Birmingham facility, effective through December 31, 2022, Green Plains Trade is obligated to throughput a minimum volume commitment of approximately 8.3 mmg per month of ethanol and other fuels and pay associated throughput fees, as well as fees for ancillary services. The agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 90 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term. Other terminal services agreements with Green Plains Trade also contain minimum volume commitments with various remaining terms. 

Rail Transportation Service Agreement. Under our rail transportation services agreement, Green Plains Trade is obligated to use the partnership to transport ethanol and other fuels from receipt points identified by Green Plains Trade, to nominated delivery points, and pay an average monthly fee of approximately $0.0236 per gallon for all railcar volumetric capacity provided over the remaining life of the agreement. The minimum railcar capacity commitment we provide to Green Plains Trade for our leased railcar fleet is approximately 69.0 mmg and the weighted average remaining term of all railcar lease agreements is 3.5 years. At December 31, 2021, the remaining term of our rail transportation services agreement with Green Plains Trade was 3.5 years. The rail transportation services agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 360 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term. 

Green Plains Trade is also obligated to use the partnership for logistical operations management and other services related to railcar volumetric capacity provided by Green Plains Trade and pay a monthly fee of approximately $0.0013 per gallon for these services. In addition, Green Plains Trade reimburses us for costs related to: (1) railcar switching and unloading fees; (2) increased costs related to changes in law or governmental regulation related to the specification, operation or maintenance of railcars; (3) demurrage charges, except when the charges are due to our gross negligence or willful misconduct; and (4) fees related to rail transportation services under transportation contracts with third-party common carriers. Green Plains Trade frequently contracts with us for additional railcar volumetric capacity during the normal course of business at comparable margins.

We lease our railcars from third parties under multiple operating lease agreements with various terms. The minimum take-or-pay capacity commitment under the rail transportation services agreement is closely aligned with our existing railcar lease agreements. As a result, when current railcar lease agreements expire, the volumetric capacity provided under the rail transportation services agreement declines accordingly. We enter new lease agreements to replace scheduled capacity reductions under the rail transportation services agreement or provide incremental capacity as requested by Green Plains Trade. We do not speculate on capacity by leasing additional railcars that are not covered by the rail transportation services agreement. 

Trucking Transportation Agreement. Under our trucking transportation agreement, Green Plains Trade pays us to transport ethanol and other fuels by truck from identified receipt points to various delivery points. Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay a monthly trucking transportation services fee equal to the aggregate amount of product volume transported in a calendar month multiplied by the applicable rate for each truck lane, which is defined as a specific route between point of origin and point of destination. Rates for each truck lane are negotiated based on product, location, mileage and other factors, including competitive factors. At December 31, 2021, the remaining term of our trucking transportation agreement was five months. The trucking transportation agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 30 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term. 

Competitive Strengths

We believe that the following competitive strengths position us to successfully execute our business strategies:

Stable and Predictable Cash Flows. A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, including a storage and throughput agreement, rail transportation services agreement, terminal services agreement and other transportation agreements. Our storage and throughput agreement and certain terminal services agreements are supported by minimum volume commitments, and our rail transportation services agreement is supported by minimum take-or-pay capacity commitments. Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay us fees for these minimum commitments regardless of actual throughput or volume, capacity used or the amount of product tendered for transport. 


Advantageous Relationship with Our Parent. Our assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol our parent produces, and the related agreements with Green Plains Trade include minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments. Furthermore, as owner of a 48.9% limited partner interest in us and our general partner interest, as well as all of our incentive distribution rights, our parent directly benefits from our growth, which provides an incentive to pursue projects that directly or indirectly enhance the value of our business and assets. This can be accomplished through organic expansion, accretive acquisitions or the development of downstream distribution services. 

Quality Assets. Our ethanol storage and fuel terminal assets are strategically located in twelve states near major rail lines and barge service, which minimizes our exposure to weather-related downtime and transportation congestion and enables access to markets across the United States. Given the nature of our assets, we expect to incur only modest maintenance-related expenses and capital expenditures in the near future. 

Proven Management Team.  Each member of our senior management team is an employee of our parent who also devotes time to manage our business affairs. We believe the commercial, operational and financial expertise of our senior management team, which averages approximately 28 years of industry experience, allows us to successfully execute our business strategies.

Business Strategy

We believe ethanol could become an increasingly larger portion of the global fuel supply driven by volatile oil prices, heightened environmental concerns, energy independence and national security concerns. We intend to further develop and strengthen our business by pursuing the following growth strategies, as capital and opportunities permit: 

Generate Stable, Fee-Based Cash Flows. A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade. Under these agreements, we do not have direct exposure to fluctuating commodity prices. We intend to continue to establish fee-based contracts with our parent and third parties that generate stable and predictable cash flows where available.

Grow Organically. We intend to collaborate primarily with our parent and potentially with other third parties to identify opportunities to develop and construct assets that provide us long-term returns on our investments. 

Acquire Strategic Assets. While not recently acquisitive, our parent has a proven history of identifying, acquiring and integrating assets that are accretive to its business, and to the extent we can, we intend to work with our parent on such opportunities that are eligible for our business model. Subject to capital constraints, we intend to monitor the marketplace for opportunities that complement or diversify our existing operations, including fuel storage and terminal assets in close proximity to our existing asset base.

Development of Downstream Distribution Services. We intend to continue to use our logistical capabilities and expertise to further develop downstream ethanol distribution services that leverage the strategic locations of our ethanol storage and fuel terminal facilities.

Conduct Safe, Reliable and Efficient Operations. We are committed to maintaining safe, reliable and environmentally compliant operations and conduct routine inspections of our assets in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We seek to improve our operating performance through preventive maintenance, employee training, and safety and development programs. 

Recent Developments

The following is a summary of our significant developments. Additional information about these items can be found elsewhere in this report or in previous reports filed with the SEC.
Amendment to Credit Agreement

On July 20, 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amended Credit Facility”) to our existing credit facility with funds and accounts managed by BlackRock (“BlackRock”) and TMI Trust Company as administrative agent.


Under the terms of the Amended Credit Facility, BlackRock purchased the outstanding balance of the existing notes from the previous lenders, and the credit facility was modified to a term loan. The term loan matures on July 20, 2026, and has a principal balance of $60.0 million. Interest on the term loan is based on three-month LIBOR plus 8.00%, with a 0% LIBOR floor. Interest is payable on the 15th day of each March, June, September and December, which commenced September 15, 2021. The term loan does not require any principal payments; however, we have the option to prepay $1.5 million per quarter beginning July 2022. On February 11, 2022, the Amended Credit Facility was modified to allow Green Plains Partners and its affiliates to repurchase outstanding notes. At that time, we purchased $1.0 million of the outstanding notes from accounts and funds managed by BlackRock and subsequently retired the notes, reducing the term loan balance to $59.0 million. Financial covenants include a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 2.50x and a minimum consolidated debt service coverage ratio of 1.10x. The Amended Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the partnership.

Ord Disposition

On March 22, 2021, our parent closed on the sale of its ethanol plant located in Ord, Nebraska to GreenAmerica Biofuels Ord LLC. Correspondingly, the storage assets located adjacent to the Ord plant were sold to our parent for $27.5 million, along with the transfer of associated railcar operating leases.

As part of this transaction, we amended the storage and throughput agreement with Green Plains Trade to reduce the quarterly minimum volume commitment from 232.5 mmg of product per calendar quarter to 217.7 mmg. In addition, the storage and throughput agreement with Green Plains Trade was extended one additional year to June 30, 2029. This transaction was reviewed and approved by the Conflicts Committee.

Impact of COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences and variants of the virus and the related economic repercussions, have created significant volatility, uncertainty, and turmoil in the energy industry. The situation surrounding COVID-19 continues to evolve and the ultimate duration and impact of COVID-19 remains highly uncertain and subject to change. 

We continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business, including how it will impact our employees, customers, vendors, and business partners. There has been no material adverse effect due to COVID-19 on our ability to maintain operations, including our financial reporting systems, our internal controls over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, to date we have not incurred any material COVID-19 related contingencies. While we did not incur significant disruptions from COVID-19 during year ended December 31, 2021, the demand for our parent’s products remains volatile, in part due to COVID-19, and in turn that could have an impact on our future operating results and financial position. 

For further information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the partnership, please see Item 1A - Risk Factors in this report.

Our Competition

Our contractual relationship with Green Plains Trade and the integrated nature of our storage tanks with our parent’s production facilities minimizes potential competition for storage and distribution services provided under our commercial agreements from other third-party operators.

We compete with independent fuel terminal operators and major fuel producers for terminal services based on terminal location, services provided, safety and cost. While there are numerous fuel producers and distributors that own terminal operations similar to ours, they often are not focused on providing services to third parties. Independent operators are often located near key distribution points with cost advantages that provide more efficient services and distribution capabilities into strategic markets with a variety of transportation options. Companies often rely on independent operators when their own storage facilities cannot manage their volumes or throughput adequately due to lack of expertise, market congestion, size constraints, optionality or the nature of the materials being stored.

We believe we are well-positioned to compete effectively in a growing market due to our expertise managing third-party terminal services and logistics. We are a low-cost operator, focused on safety and efficiency, and capable of managing the needs of multiple constituencies across geographical markets. While the competitiveness of our services may be impacted by competition from new entrants, transportation constraints, industry production levels and related storage needs, we believe there are significant barriers to entry that partially mitigate these risks, including significant capital costs, execution risk, 


complex permitting requirements, development cycle, financial and working capital constraints, expertise and experience, and ability to effectively capture strategic assets or locations.

Seasonality

Our business is directly affected by the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels in the markets served by our assets. However, the effects of seasonality on our revenues are substantially mitigated through our fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, which include minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments.
Major Customer

We are highly dependent on Green Plains Trade and anticipate deriving a substantial portion of our revenues from them in the foreseeable future. Revenues from Green Plains Trade totaled approximately $74.2 million, or 94.6%, $78.5 million, or 94.2%, and $75.5 million, or 91.7% of our total revenues, during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the business risks of Green Plains Trade and any development that materially and adversely affects its operations, financial condition or market reputation. For additional information, please refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry and Risks Related to an Investment in Us.
Regulatory Matters

Government Ethanol Programs and Policies

We are sensitive to government programs and policies that affect the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels, which in turn may impact the volume of ethanol and other fuels we handle. Over the years, various bills and amendments have been proposed in the House and Senate, which would eliminate the RFS entirely, eliminate the corn based ethanol portion of the mandate, and make it more difficult to sell fuel blends with higher levels of ethanol. We believe it is unlikely that any of these bills will become law in the current Congress. In addition, the manner in which the EPA administers the RFS and related regulations can have a significant impact on the actual amount of ethanol blended into the domestic fuel supply. 

Federal mandates and state-level clean fuel programs supporting the use of renewable fuels are a significant driver of ethanol demand in the U.S. Ethanol policies are influenced by concerns for the environment, diversifying the fuel supply, and reducing the country’s dependence on foreign oil. Consumer acceptance of flexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs) and higher ethanol blends in non-FFVs may be necessary before ethanol can achieve further growth in U.S. market share. In addition, expansion of clean fuel programs in other states, or a national low carbon fuel standard could increase the demand for ethanol, depending on how it is structured.

The RFS sets a floor for biofuels use in the United States. When the RFS was established in 2010, the required volume of conventional, or corn-based, ethanol to be blended with gasoline was to increase each year until it reached 15.0 billion gallons in 2015, which left the EPA to address existing limitations in both supply and demand. As of this filing, the EPA has proposed reducing the conventional ethanol RVOs for 2020 and 2021 to reflect lower fuel demand during the pandemic, and proposed the statutory 15 billion gallons for 2022.

According to the RFS, if mandatory renewable fuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumes through 2022, the year through which the statutorily prescribed volumes run. While conventional ethanol maintained 15 billion gallons, 2019 was the second consecutive year that the total RVO was more than 20% below the statutory volume levels. Thus, the EPA was expected to initiate a reset rulemaking, and modify statutory volumes through 2022, and do so based on the same factors they are to use in setting the RVOs post 2022. These factors include environmental impact, domestic energy security, expected production, infrastructure impact, consumer costs, job creation, price of agricultural commodities, food prices, and rural economic development. However, in late 2019, the EPA announced it would not be moving forward with a reset rulemaking in 2020. It is unclear when or if the current EPA will propose a reset rulemaking, though they have stated an intention to propose a post 2022 set rulemaking as required by law.

Under the RFS, RINs and SREs are important tools impacting supply and demand. The EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders, and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use in each annual RVO based on their percentage of total domestic transportation fuel sales. Obligated parties use RINs to show compliance with the RFS mandated volumes. Ethanol producers assign RINs to renewable fuels and the RINs are detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel domestically. Market participants can trade the detached RINs in the open market. The market price 


of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and can influence purchasing decisions by obligated parties. As it relates to SREs, a small refinery is defined as one that processes fewer than 75,000 barrels of petroleum per day. Small refineries can petition the EPA for a SRE which, if approved, waives their portion of the annual RVO requirements. The EPA, through consultation with the DOE and the USDA can grant a full or partial waiver, or deny it outright within 90 days of submittal. The EPA granted significantly more of these waivers for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 reporting years than they had in prior years, totaling 790 mmg of waived requirements for the 2016 compliance year, 1.82 billion gallons for 2017 and 1.43 billion gallons for 2018. In doing so, the EPA effectively reduced the RFS mandated volumes for those compliance years by those amounts respectively, and as a result, RIN values declined significantly. In the waning days of the Trump administration, the EPA approved three additional SREs, reversing one denial from 2018 and granting two from 2019. A total of 88 SREs were granted under the Trump Administration, totaling 4.3 billion gallons of potential blending demand erased. The EPA, under the current administration, reversed the three SREs issued in the final weeks of the previous administration, and in the RVO rulemaking they proposed denying all pending SREs. There are multiple legal challenges to how the EPA has handled SREs and RFS rulemakings.

The One-Pound Waiver, which was extended in May 2019 to allow E15 to be sold year-round to all vehicles model year 2001 and newer, was challenged in an action filed in Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit. On July 2, 2021, the Circuit Court vacated the EPA’s rule so the future of summertime, defined as June 1 to September 15, sales of E15 to non-FFVs is uncertain. The Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to this ruling. As of this filing, E15 is sold year-round in approximately 30 states.

In October 2019, the White House directed the USDA and EPA to move forward with rulemaking to expand access to higher blends of biofuels. This includes funding for infrastructure, labeling changes and allowing E15 to be sold through E10 infrastructure. The USDA rolled out the Higher Blend Infrastructure Incentive Program in the summer of 2020, providing competitive grants to fuel terminals and retailers for installing equipment for dispensing higher blends of ethanol and biodiesel. In December 2021, the USDA announced they would administer another infrastructure grant program. Congress is considering legislation that would provide for an additional $1 billion in USDA grants for biofuel infrastructure from 2022 to 2031.

To respond to COVID-19 health crisis and attempt to offset the subsequent economic damage, Congress passed multiple relief measures, most notably the CARES Act in March 2020, which created and funded multiple programs that have impacted our industry. The USDA was given additional resources for the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and they are using those funds to provide direct payments to farmers, including corn farmers from whom our parent purchases most of its feedstock for ethanol production. Similar to the trade aid payments made by the USDA over the past two years, this cash injection for farmers could cause them to delay marketing decisions and increase the price our parent pays to purchase corn. The CARES Act also allowed for certain net operating loss carrybacks, which has allowed our parent to receive certain tax refunds. In December 2020, Congress passed and then President Trump signed into law an annual spending package coupled with another COVID relief bill which included additional funds for the Secretary of Agriculture to distribute to those impacted by the pandemic. The language of the bill specifically includes biofuels producers as eligible for some of this aid, which is anticipated to be distributed in March 2022.

See further discussion in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Environmental and Other Regulation

Under the omnibus agreement, our parent is required to indemnify us from all known and certain unknown environmental liabilities associated with owning and operating our assets that existed on or before the closing of the IPO. In turn, we agree to indemnify our parent from future environmental liabilities associated with the activities of the partnership. Construction or maintenance of our terminal facilities and storage facilities may impact wetlands, which are regulated by the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under the Clean Water Act.

Our parent’s ethanol production plants emit carbon dioxide as a by-product of the ethanol production process. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions, which the EPA later addressed in the RFS. While some of our parent’s plants operate as grandfathered at their current authorized capacity under the RFS mandate, expansion above these capacities at grandfathered plants will require a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement.


In addition, various states and countries are adopting regulatory schemes similar to what California has adopted. Specifically, CARB adopted LCFS requiring a 10% reduction in average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel transportation fuels in California from 2010 to 2020. 

See further discussion in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Employees

We do not have any direct employees. We are managed and operated by the executive officers of our general partner, who are also officers of our parent, and our general partner’s board of directors. Our general partner and its affiliates have approximately 35 full-time equivalent employees under its direct management and supervision supporting our operations.

In addition, we have entered into service agreements with unaffiliated third-parties to provide railcar unloading and terminal services for several of our terminal facilities. Under these service agreements, the third parties are responsible for providing the personnel necessary to perform various railcar unloading and terminal services. The third parties are considered independent contractors and none of their employees or contractors are considered employees, representatives or agents of the partnership.
