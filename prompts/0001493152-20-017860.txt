ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
 
8i Enterprises Acquisition Corp (“8i”) is a British Virgin Islands business company incorporated on November 24, 2017 as a blank check company for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, with one or more target businesses. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic location, although we intend to focus on targets located in Asia.
 
On April 1, 2019, we consummated our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 5,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share (the “Ordinary Shares”), one redeemable warrant to purchase one-half of one ordinary share (the “Public Warrants”) and one right to receive 1/10 of an Ordinary Share upon the consummation of our initial business combination (the “Rights”). The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 750,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any.
 
On April 1, 2019, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with 8i Enterprises Pte Ltd, an entity controlled by 8i’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“Enterprises”) of 221,250 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,212,500. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO, except that the warrants underlying the Private Units (i) may be exercised on a cashless basis at the holder’s option and (ii) will not be redeemable by the Company, in each case as long as they are held by Enterprises or its permitted transferees. Additionally, because the Private Units were issued in a private transaction, our Sponsor and its permitted transferees will be allowed to exercise the warrants included in the Private Units for cash even if a registration statement covering the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants is not effective and receive unregistered Ordinary Shares. Additionally, Enterprises agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the registration statement relating to the IPO) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. Enterprises was granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the Private Units.
 
The underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full and, on April 4, 2019, the underwriters purchased 750,000 over-allotment option Units, which were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $7,500,000. On April 4, 2019, simultaneously with the sale of the over-allotment Units, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 18,750 Private Units to Enterprises, generating gross proceeds of $187,500.
 
A total of $57,500,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the over-allotment option Units) and the private placements on April 1, 2019 and April 4, 2019 were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders at JPMorgan Chase Bank maintained by Wilmington Trust Company, acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination and (ii) the Company’s failure to consummate a business combination by September 30, 2020.

Business Combination Agreement
 
On July 9, 2019, 8i entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Diginex Limited, a Hong Kong company (“Diginex”), the shareholders of Diginex (the “Sellers”) and Pelham Limited, a Hong Kong company, as representative of the Sellers (the “Representative”). Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Sellers agreed to sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to 8i all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Diginex owned by the Sellers in exchange for the issuance to the Sellers of an aggregate of 20,000,000 ordinary shares, no par value, of 8i (the “Share Exchange”).
 
On October 8, 2019, each of the parties to the Share Exchange Agreement entered into an amendment and joinder to the Share Exchange Agreement (the “Amendment”) with Diginex Limited, a Singapore public company limited by shares (formerly known as Digital Innovative Limited) (“Singapore NewCo”), and its wholly-owned subsidiary DIGITAL INNOVATIVE LIMITED, a British Virgin Islands business company (“BVI NewCo”), for the purpose of joining both entities as parties to the Share Exchange Agreement. The Amendment reflects that prior to the consummation of the Share Exchange, BVI NewCo will merge with and into 8i (the “Reincorporation Merger”, and together with the “Share Exchange,” the “Business Combination”), and 8i will be the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Singapore NewCo pursuant to a merger agreement by and among Singapore NewCo, BVI NewCo and 8i (the “Merger Agreement”) and a plan of merger by and among 8i and BVI NewCo (the “Plan of Merger”). At the closing of the Reincorporation Merger, Singapore NewCo will issue ordinary shares, with no par value (the “Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares”), and warrants to 8i’s shareholders (the “Singapore NewCo Warrants”), as set forth in the Merger Agreement. The Amendment also provides, among other things, (i) that Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares will be issued to the Sellers in the Share Exchange in lieu of 8i ordinary shares, (ii) that references to the proxy statement in the Share Exchange Agreement are replaced with references to this proxy statement/prospectus, and (iii) that references to the Purchaser and its obligations (x) post-closing, (y) with respect to Nasdaq matters, and (z) for directors’ and officers’ indemnification and liability insurance in the Share Exchange Agreement, are replaced with Singapore NewCo. The “Closing Date” shall mean the date on which the Business Combination is consummated.
 
On January 28, 2020, each of the parties to the Amendment entered into a second amendment to the Share Exchange Agreement (the “Second Amendment”), for the purpose of increasing the size of Diginex’s permitted pre-Closing Date private placement of its ordinary shares from $30 million to $50 million.
 
On May 6, 2020, each of the parties to the Second Amendment entered into a third amendment to the Share Exchange Agreement (the “Third Amendment”) to, among other things, (a) extend the outside closing date of the Share Exchange to June 23, 2020, (b) increase the number of Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares issuable to the Sellers in the Share Exchange from 20,000,000 to 25,000,000, (c) increase the number of shares the Sellers are entitled to receive if the closing price of the Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares satisfy certain thresholds (the “Earnout Shares”) from an aggregate of 5,000,000 to 12,000,000, adjust closing price targets and to increase the milestone dates by which the Earnout Shares could be issued from three years to four years after the anniversary of the Closing Date; (d) increase the number of options to purchase Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares received upon cancellation of the outstanding options to purchase ordinary shares under Diginex’s existing incentive plan from 4,200,000 to 5,600,000, and (e) allow 8i to issue up to 1,000,000 Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares to third party advisors or consultants to (i) assist 8i with maintaining funds of at least $15,000,000 in the trust account after giving effect to all 8i ordinary share redemptions, but prior to taking into account 8i’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the transactions contemplated by the Amended Share Exchange Agreement, or (ii) provide market making services to Diginex after the Closing.

The Third Amendment includes new covenants of the parties prior to the Closing Date, such as (a) 8i shall convert all outstanding promissory notes issued in favor of 8i Enterprises Pte. Ltd. into 8i private units as of the Closing Date (the “Sponsor Loan Conversion”), (b) 8i shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Chardan Capital LLC (“Chardan”) to agree to convert, effective as of the Closing Date, deferred underwriting compensation in the amount of $1,725,000 owed to Chardan and any additional fees to be paid by 8i to Chardan upon the consummation of the Closing into Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares at $10.00 per share, which shares will be subject to a lock-up agreement restricting any transfer thereof for a period of no less than six months after Closing, (c) Diginex will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause one of its service providers to enter into a lock-up agreement in connection with receipt of Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares that such service provider will receive on the Closing Date for a period of no less than six months after the Closing Date, and (d) each of 8i and Diginex will use best efforts to assist the other party to fulfill the new covenants relating to (i) 8i maintaining $15,000,000 in the trust account as of the Closing Date after giving effect to 8i’s ordinary share redemptions, but prior to taking into account 8i’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the transactions contemplated by the Amended Share Exchange Agreement, and (ii) Diginex raising at least $15,000,000 through the issuance of new ordinary shares to be completed no later than the Closing (the “Subsequent Diginex Equity Private Placement”). The failure to comply with the covenants described in clause (d) of this paragraph will not constitute a material breach of the Amended Share Exchange Agreement for the purposes of fulfilling certain closing conditions of parties, or with respect to the indemnification or termination provisions set forth in the Amended Share Exchange Agreement. In the event the respective covenants that are the subject matter of clause (d) of this paragraph are not fulfilled, or, (i) if the market value of the unrestricted publicly held 8i ordinary shares (as calculated under the rules of The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”)) that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing Date (after giving effect to the 8i ordinary share redemptions), and (ii) the combined stockholders equity of 8i and Diginex (after giving effect to the 8i ordinary share redemptions, the Share Exchange and the transactions contemplated thereby), fail to satisfy Nasdaq listing requirements ((i) and (ii), collectively, the “Nasdaq Requirements”), the parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable resolution with respect thereto. However, if they are unable to reach an agreement, such failure will not be a material breach on the part of any party that elects to terminate the Amended Share Exchange Agreement because the transactions contemplated thereunder did not occur prior to June 23, 2020, the outside closing date.
 
The Third Amendment includes new covenants of Diginex that (a) without 8i’s prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Diginex and its affiliates will not, directly or indirectly, or through any other person (including, its directors, officers and agents) engage with or contact, for the purpose of making an investment into Diginex or any of its affiliates, any potential investor actually introduced to Diginex or its affiliates by 8i or its affiliates during the period commencing on April 27, 2020 and ending on the earlier of the Closing Date and termination of the Amended Share Exchange Agreement, and who have not previously (i) had any direct or indirect business or investment relationship with Diginex or its affiliates or (ii) engaged in any discussions with or contacted or been contacted by, directly or indirectly, or through any other person (including, its directors, officers and agents), Diginex or the Diginex’s affiliates, advisors or representatives regarding a potential business or investment relationship, until the Closing Date, or in the event the Amended Share Exchange Agreement is terminated, for a period of 12 months after the termination, and (b) without 8i’s prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) Diginex will not use any proceeds of the Subsequent Diginex Private Placement, up to $15,000,000, for any purpose other than its operating expenses and capital expenditures.
 
The Third Amendment includes new covenants of all parties that, (a) 8i will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause one of its service providers to enter into a lock-up agreement in connection with receipt of Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares that such service provider will receive for a period of no less than six months after the Closing Date, (b) 8i will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the balance of the trust account after giving effect to 8i’s ordinary share redemptions, but prior to taking into account 8i’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the transactions contemplated by the Amended Share Exchange Agreement, to be an amount greater than or equal to $15,000,000, (c) prior to the Closing Date, Diginex will use its commercially reasonable efforts to raise at least $15,000,000 through the Subsequent Diginex Private Placement, and (d) 8i and Diginex will use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the Nasdaq Requirements.
 
The Third Amendment includes new conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Share Exchange, such as (i) the balance of the trust account will be an amount greater than or equal to $15,000,000 after giving effect to 8i’s ordinary share redemptions, but prior to taking into account 8i’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the Share Exchange, and (ii) during the period commencing on April 24, 2020 and ending on the Closing Date, Diginex will raise at least $15,000,000 through the Subsequent Diginex Private Placement. As a new condition to Diginex’s obligation to consummate the Share Exchange, 8i will deliver to Diginex evidence of the Sponsor Loan Conversion. The existing condition to consummate the Share Exchange that 8i receives executed copies of lock-up agreements from all of the Diginex shareholders has been revised, so that in Diginex’s sole discretion up to 5,000,000 of the Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares issued in the Subsequent Diginex Private Placement may be issued without being subject to the restrictions in the lock-up agreement.

The Third Amendment provides Diginex the right, at its sole option, to terminate the Amended Share Exchange Agreement if the Nasdaq Requirements are not met, or if after giving effect to the 8i ordinary share redemptions, the Share Exchange and the transactions contemplated thereby, 8i fails to comply with the net tangible assets requirements set forth in its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association.
 
Of the 25,000,000 Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares issuable to the Sellers in the Share Exchange, 2,000,000 Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares (which will not be fully paid at issuance) will be deposited into an escrow account for a period of twelve months (the “Escrow Period”) to satisfy any potential indemnification claims against Sellers brought pursuant to the Amended Share Exchange Agreement (the “Escrow Shares”). At the closing of the Share Exchange, each option to purchase ordinary shares of Diginex (the “Diginex Options”) outstanding under Diginex’s existing incentive plan, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and the holders of the Diginex Options will receive options to acquire an aggregate of 5,600,000 Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares (the “Singapore NewCo Options”) in exchange for such cancellation. The Singapore NewCo Options may not be transferred, assigned or sold for a period of fifteen (15) months following the consummation of the Business Combination. Each Singapore NewCo Option will, without any requirement for payment, automatically convert into one (1) Singapore NewCo Ordinary Share, which Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares shall be issued to each holder of a Singapore NewCo Option as follows: (a) one-third (1/3) on the date that is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date, (b) one-third (1/3) on the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, and (c) one-third (1/3) on the date that is twenty-one (21) months after the Closing Date, in the case of each of (a), (b) and (c), rounded to the nearest Singapore NewCo Ordinary Share, subject to certain limitations set forth herein. The Singapore NewCo Options to be issued in the Share Exchange will be separate from and in addition to any options or other awards issued or issuable under the Digital Innovative Limited 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”).
 
The Sellers will be entitled to receive up to an additional 12,000,000 Earnout Shares after the closing of the Business Combination if the closing price of Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares on Nasdaq (or any other applicable securities exchange) is equal to or greater than the stock prices set forth below during any five trading days out of any 30 trading day period (the “Trading Period”) following the closing of the Business Combination until the applicable milestone date: (1) 3,000,000 Earnout Shares if the closing price is USD$15.00 during any Trading Period ending on or before the first anniversary of the Closing Date; (2) 3,000,000 Earnout Shares if the closing price is USD$20.00 during any Trading Period ending on or before the second anniversary of the Closing Date; (3) 3,000,000 Earnout Shares if the closing price is USD$25.00 during any Trading Period ending on or before the third anniversary of the Closing Date; and (4) 3,000,000 Earnout Shares if the closing price is USD$30.00 during any Trading Period ending on or before fourth anniversary of the Closing Date. All share and per share amounts above shall be proportionally adjusted for share splits, dividends, and similar events.
 
On June 24, 2020, each of the parties to the Third Amendment entered into a fourth amendment to the Share Exchange Agreement (the “Fourth Amendment,” and together with the Share Exchange Agreement, the Amendment, the Second Amendment and the Third Amendment, the “Amended Share Exchange Agreement”) to, among other things, (a) extend the outside Closing Date of the Business Combination to September 28, 2020 and (b) agree to hold the Meeting no later than September 15, 2020.
 
The Fourth Amendment includes new covenants that all of the parties will, (i) take all steps required to extend the time available to consummate the Business Combination for an additional three months to September 30, 2020, including, sharing payment of the extension fees payable to the 8i trust account in the amount of $575,000, (ii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to hold the Meeting no later than September 15, 2020 and hold the closing of the Business Combination no later than September 28, 2020, and (iii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to have 6,411,100 of the Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares issuable, in the aggregate, to various parties pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement be freely tradeable from the day immediately following the Closing Date.

In connection with the Business Combination, we filed and will file relevant materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including a proxy statement on Schedule 14A. Promptly after filing our definitive proxy statement with the SEC, we mailed the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each stockholder entitled to vote at the special meeting relating to the acquisition. INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF 8i ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION THAT 8i WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT 8i, DIGINEX AND THE ACQUISITION. The preliminary proxy statement, the definitive proxy statement and other relevant materials in connection with the acquisition, and any other documents filed by us with the SEC, may be obtained free of charge at the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) or by writing to us at 6 Eu Tong Sen Street, #08-13 The Central, Singapore 059817.
 
Recent Developments
 
On each of July 2, 2019, July 23, 2019, September 25, 2019, October 15, 2019, January 7, 2020, February 3, 2020, March 3, 2020, March 26, 2020, May 11, 2020, June 24, 2020, July 24, 2020, August 3, 2020 and September 4, 2020, 8i issued the Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $200,000, $100,000, $150,000, $200,000, $70,000, $60,000, $100,000, $575,000, $16,000, $287,500, $132,000, $50,000 and $280,000, respectively (the “Notes”), to 8i Enterprises Pte Ltd, an entity controlled by 8i’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“Enterprises”). Pursuant to the terms of the Notes, the Notes do not bear interest and mature upon closing of a business combination by the Company. Each Note is convertible at Enterprises’ option upon providing written notice of such conversion at least one business day prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, into Private Units consisting of one ordinary share, one redeemable warrant to acquire one-half of one ordinary share (which entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per full share), and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of an ordinary share upon the consummation of an initial business combination (which securities have terms equivalent to the terms of the private placement securities issued in connection with the Company’s IPO) at a price of $10.00 per share at the closing of a business combination. Initially up to $500,000 of the outstanding Notes were convertible into Private Units. However, in order to comply with 8i’s obligations under the Third Amendment to convert all of the Notes, 8i’s Board authorized and approved the conversion of Notes in excess of $500,000 to such amount as necessary to fulfill 8i’s obligations but not exceeding $3,000,000. Enterprises has provided 8i with written notice to convert the Notes into 175,850 Private Units immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination.
 
On March 3, 2020 and June 24, 2020, 8i issued unsecured promissory notes to Diginex in the aggregate principal amount of up to $387,500 (the “Diginex Notes”). The Diginex Notes do not bear interest and mature upon closing of a business combination by the Company. The proceeds of the Diginex Notes will be used for the Company’s share of the cost arising from an additional services agreement with Chardan and for the cost of extending the combination period by an additional 3 months (until the end of September 2020).
 
Competitive Advantages
 
We believe our specific competitive strengths to be the following:
 
Status as a Publicly Listed Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to prospective target businesses. As a publicly listed company, we will offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering. We believe that target businesses will favor this alternative, which we believe is less expensive, while offering greater certainty of execution than the traditional initial public offering. During an initial public offering, there are typically expenses incurred in marketing, which would be costlier than a business combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is approved by our shareholders (if applicable) and the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with shareholders’ interests than it would as a private company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented management staffs.

-

Strong Financial Position and Flexibility
 
With the funds held in our trust account, we can offer a target business a variety of options to facilitate a business combination and fund future expansion and growth of its business. Because we are able to consummate a business combination using the cash proceeds from the IPO or debt, we have the flexibility to use an efficient structure allowing us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to address the needs of the parties. However, if a business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay for the purchase price, we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination. We have currently not taken any steps to secure third party financing.
Competitive Weaknesses
 
We believe our competitive weaknesses to be the following:
 
Limited Financial Resources
 
Our financial reserves will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of venture capital firms, leveraged buyout firms and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. In addition, our financial resources could be reduced because of our obligation to convert shares held by our public shareholders as well as any tender offer we conduct (subject to our being required to maintain net tangible assets in the trust account of no less than $5,000,0001). In the event that we did not have enough funds available to us to complete a business combination, we might be required to seek additional financing in order to complete a business combination.
 
Lack of experience with blank check companies
 
Our management team is not experienced in pursuing business combinations on behalf of blank check companies. Other blank check companies may be sponsored and managed by individuals with prior experience in completing business combinations between blank check companies and target businesses. Our management’s lack of experience may not be viewed favorably by target businesses.
 
Limited technical and human resources
 
As a blank check company, we have limited technical and human resources. Many venture capital funds, leveraged buyout firms and operating businesses possess greater technical and human resources than we do and thus we may be at a disadvantage when competing with them for target businesses.
 
Delay associated with shareholder approval or tender offer
 
We may be required to seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination. If we are not required to obtain shareholder approval of an initial business combination, we will allow our shareholders to sell their shares to us pursuant to a tender offer. Both seeking shareholder approval and conducting a tender offer will delay the consummation of our initial business combination. Other companies competing with us for acquisition opportunities may not be subject to similar requirement, or may be able to satisfy such requirements more quickly than we can. As a result, we may be at a disadvantage in competing for these opportunities.
 
Inability to find suitable target companies
 
We may not be able to find a target that meets our selection investment criteria. Even though we have broad discretion to acquire a company that falls outside of our selection criteria, such a target may be less desirable than one that falls within our selection criteria.

-

Acquisition Strategy
 
Our acquisition strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, to build a public company. Our selection process will leverage our team’s network of industry, private equity and lending community relationships as well as relationship with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. We intend to deploy a pro-active, thematic sourcing strategy and to focus on companies where we believe the combination of our relationships, capital and capital markets expertise and operating experience of James Tan, can help accelerate the target business’ growth and performance.
Investment Criteria
 
The focus of our management team is to create shareholder value by leveraging its experience to improve the efficiency of the business while implementing strategies to grow revenue and profits organically and/or through acquisitions. Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating prospective businesses, we may deviate from these criteria and guidelines should we see fit to do so:

● | Growth Potential 
--+---------------------

 
As a result of the Asia region’s strong growth over the past several decades, the region has become home to a large number of small domestic and regional companies, which are serving the ever-increasing needs of economies locally. While such companies have performed relatively well, the vast majority of these companies suffer from a lack of insightful strategy, insufficient capital, operational inefficiencies and various succession issues (as many companies are first-generation and family-owned). This has also resulted in high degree of market fragmentation, without any established regional market leaders. We will seek target businesses for which we can provide strategic advice, access to sufficient capital and effective operational expertise, to grow the business.
 

● | Long-term Revenue Visibility with Defensible Market Position 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 
We intend to seek target companies that are at an inflection point, such as those requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate by developing new products or services, or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance and where an acquisition may help facilitate growth.
 

● | Benefits from Being a U.S. Public Company (Value Creation and Marketing Opportunities) 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We intend to seek target companies that should offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our shareholders. We intend to seek to acquire a target on terms and in a manner that leverages our experience. We expect to evaluate financial returns based on (i) the potential for organic growth in cash flows, (ii) the ability to achieve cost savings, (iii) the ability to accelerate growth, including through the opportunity for follow-on acquisitions and (iv) the prospects for creating value through other value creation initiatives. Potential upside from growth in the target business’ earnings and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks.
 

● | Potential Benefit from Globalization Trends and Possession of Competitive Advantages 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Target companies exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our company specific analysis and due diligence review. For a potential target company, this process will include, among other things, a review and analysis of the company’s capital structure, quality of earnings, potential for operational improvements, corporate governance, customers, material contracts, and industry background and trends. We intend to leverage the operational experience and disciplined investment approach of our team to identify opportunities to unlock value that our experience in complex situations allows us to pursue.

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
 
We will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of our proposed business combination or allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. If we so choose and we are legally permitted to do so, we will have the flexibility to avoid a shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We will have until September 30, 2020 to consummate our initial business combination. On March 26, 2020, 8i extended the time it has to complete an initial business combination for an additional three months from April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020, by depositing $575,000 into the trust account for the benefit of its public stockholders. Subsequently, on June 24, 2020, 8i extended the time it has to complete an initial business combination for an additional three months from July 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020 (the “Second Extension Deadline”), by depositing $575,000 into the trust account for the benefit of its public stockholders. If 8i does not consummate the Business Combination and fails to complete an initial business combination by September 30, 2020, 8i will be required to dissolve and liquidate. In exchange for these deposits, the insiders received a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of the deposits that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes will either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, or, at the relevant insider’s discretion, converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Our shareholders have approved the issuance of the private units upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. Our insiders and their affiliates or designees were not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the aforementioned time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem or purchase 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public shareholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the public rights will expire and will be worthless.

If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within this time period, we will liquidate the trust account and distribute the proceeds held therein to our public shareholders and dissolve. If we are forced to liquidate, we anticipate that we would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date (including any accrued interest). Prior to such distribution, we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation.
 
Pursuant to the Nasdaq listing rules, our initial business combination must be with a target business or businesses whose collective fair market value is at least equal to 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for such business combination, although this may entail simultaneous acquisitions of several target businesses. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Our board of directors will have broad discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of any prospective target business. The target business or businesses that we acquire may have a collective fair market value substantially in excess of 80% of the trust account balance.
 
We are not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party that the target business we select has a fair market value in excess of at least 80% of the balance of the trust account unless our board of directors cannot make such determination on its own. We are also not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party indicating that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view unless the target is affiliated with our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates.
 
We currently anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, only the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test.
 
Management Operating and Investment Experience
 
We believe that our executive officers possess the experience, skills and contacts necessary to source, evaluate, and execute an attractive business combination. See the section titled “Management” for complete information on the experience of our officers and directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs and will allocate their time to other businesses. We presently expect each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). The past successes of our executive officers and directors do not guarantee that we will successfully consummate an initial business combination.

As more fully discussed in “Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under British Virgin Islands law, prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Most of our officers and directors currently have certain pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Ordinary Shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period.
 
We are currently a “foreign private issuer” as defined in Rule 405, but are voluntarily choosing to register and report using domestic forms. We are required to determine our status as a foreign private issuer for the 2018 fiscal year as of the last day of our second quarter, or June 30. On such date, if we no longer qualify as a “foreign private issuer” (as set forth in Rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act), we will then become subject to the U.S. domestic issuer rules as of the first day of our 2019 fiscal year, or January 1, 2019.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of the IPO, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a transaction; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our obligation to convert public shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; 
● | Nasdaq may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination; 
● | our outstanding warrants, rights and unit purchase options and the potential future dilution they represent; 
● | our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC upon consummation of our initial business combination; 


● | our obligation to either repay or issue units upon conversion of up to $500,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private units (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and 
● | the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination. 

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Employees
 
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once management locates a suitable target business to acquire, they will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time to our affairs) than they would prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
