Item 1. | Business


We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 3, 2004 and commenced operations on January 1, 2005. Our principal executive offices are located at 1250 Broadway, 29th Floor, New York, NY 10001. For convenience in this report, the terms “Company,” “Varonis,” “we” and “us” may be used to refer to Varonis Systems, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries, except where indicated otherwise. Our telephone number is (877) 292-8767.

Overview

Varonis is a pioneer in data security and analytics, fighting a different battle than conventional cybersecurity companies. We are pioneers because over a decade ago, we recognized that enterprise capacity to create and share data far exceeded its capacity to protect it. We believed the vast movement of information from analog to digital mediums combined with increasing information dependence would change both the global economy and the risk profiles of corporations and governments. Since then our focus has been on using innovation to address the cyber-implications of this movement, creating software that provides new ways to track, alert and protect data wherever it is stored. 
Data continues to amass in new and existing data stores both on premises and in the cloud, a trend we have seen accelerate as companies around the world embark on a wave of digital transformation initiatives. As these data stores grow, the relationships between the data they hold and the users that collaborate with it grow more complex, making those relationships difficult to visualize, understand and control without automation. Because enterprises now use many different combinations of data stores and require different levels of protection, our offering provides coverage flexibility through software licensing. We aim to keep pace with the relentless growth and complexity of data, starting in 2005 with a single license, offering ten licenses at the time of our initial public offering in 2014, and today offering more than 25 integrated licenses across the most common on premises and cloud data stores. We plan to continue investing in product development to deliver new products in the future.
Our software specializes in data protection, threat detection and response and compliance. Varonis software enables enterprises to protect data stored on premises and in the cloud: sensitive files and emails; confidential personal data belonging to customers, patients and employees; financial records; strategic and product plans; and other intellectual property. Recognizing the complexities of securing data, we have built an integrated platform for security and analytics to simplify and streamline security and data management.

The Varonis Data Security Platform, built on patented technology, helps enterprises protect data against cyberattacks from both internal and external threats. Our products enable enterprises to analyze data, account activity and user behavior to detect attacks. Our Data Security Platform prevents or limits unauthorized use of sensitive information, prevents potential cyberattacks and limits others by automatically locking down data, allowing access to those who need it and automating the removal of stale data when it is no longer useful. Our products efficiently sustain a secure state with automation and address additional important use cases including data protection, data governance, zero trust, compliance, data privacy, classification and threat detection and response. Our Data Security Platform is driven by a proprietary technology, our Metadata Framework, that extracts critical metadata, or data about data, from an enterprise’s information technology ("IT") infrastructure. Our Data Security Platform uses this contextual information to map functional relationships among employees, data objects, systems, content and usage.

The revolution in internet search occurred when search engines began to mine internet metadata, such as the links between pages, in addition to page content, thereby making the internet’s content more usable and consequently more valuable. Similarly, our Data Security Platform creates advanced searchable data structures out of available content and metadata, providing real-time intelligence about an enterprise’s massive volumes of data, making it more secure, accessible and manageable.

We believe that the technology underlying our Data Security Platform is our primary competitive advantage. The strength of our solution is driven by several proprietary technologies and methodologies that we have developed, coupled with how we have combined them into our highly versatile platform. Our belief in our technological advantage stems from us having developed a way to do each of the following:

•analyze the relationships between users and data with sophisticated algorithms, including cluster analyses and machine learning;
•visualize and depict the analyses in an intuitive manner, including simulating contemplated changes and automatically executing tasks that are becoming increasingly more complex for IT and business personnel;
•identify and automatically classify data as sensitive, critical, private or regulated;
•automate remediation to directory service objects and access controls on large file systems to safely ensure a least privilege model;
•profile users, devices and data to detect suspicious account behavior and unusual file and email activity using deep analysis of metadata, machine learning and user behavior analytics; 
•generate meaningful, actionable alerts when security-related incidents are detected; 
•enable security teams to investigate and respond to cyber threats more quickly and conclusively;
•automatically respond to severe incidents like ransomware to limit potential impact and reduce recovery times;
•determine relevant metadata and security information to capture without impacting the enterprise's computing and network infrastructure;
•modify and enrich that metadata in a way that makes it comparable and analyzable despite it having originated from disparate IT systems, and create supplemental metadata, as needed, when the existing IT infrastructure’s activity logs are insufficient;
•decipher the key functional relationships of metadata, the underlying data, and its creators; and
•use those functional relationships to create a graphical depiction, or map, of the data that will endure as enterprises continuously add large volumes of data to their network and storage resources.
The broad applicability of our technology has resulted in our customers deploying our platform for numerous use cases. These use cases include: automatic discovery and classification of high-risk, sensitive data; automated remediation of over-exposed data; centralized visibility and risk analysis of enterprise data and monitoring of user behavior and file activity; security monitoring and risk reduction; data breach, insider threat, malware and ransomware detection; automatic response to ransomware and other severe incidents to limit exposure and reduce recovery times; data ownership identification, assignment, and automatic involvement; forensics, reporting and auditing with searchable logs; meeting security policy and compliance regulation; automatic data migration; intelligent archiving; and automated indexing for data subject requests related to privacy and compliance requirements.
We sell substantially all of our products and services to channel partners, including distributors and resellers, which sell to end-user customers, which we refer to in this report as our customers. We believe that our sales model, which combines the leverage of a channel sales model with our highly trained and professional sales force, has and will continue to play a major role in our ability to grow and to successfully deliver our unique value proposition for enterprise data. While our products serve customers of all sizes, in all industries and all geographies, the marketing focus and majority of our sales focus is on targeting organizations with 1,000 users or more who can make larger initial purchases with us and, over time, have a greater potential lifetime value. Our customers span leading firms in the financial services, public, healthcare, industrial, insurance, energy and utilities, technology, consumer and retail, media and entertainment and education sectors. We believe our existing customers represent significant future revenue opportunities for us.
Prior to 2019, an insignificant amount of our revenues had been generated pursuant to on-premises, subscription-based license arrangements ("subscription licenses"). In these arrangements, the customer has the right to use the software over a designated period of time. In the first quarter of 2019, we announced our transition to a subscription-based business model, and, as we have completed our transition, our subscription revenues now account for almost all of our total license revenues.
COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization (”WHO”) declared the novel coronavirus COVID-19 (including any variants and mutations, "COVID-19") a global pandemic. The pandemic, which has continued to spread, has adversely affected workforces, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn, as well as, continued economic uncertainty and is expected to disrupt general business operations until the virus is contained. We believe that the impact of COVID-19 on the way organizations operate and its long-lasting effects has increased our long-term opportunity to help our customers protect their data and detect threats, as well as achieve regulatory compliance. Nevertheless, in the early stages of the pandemic, we experienced a negative impact on our results of operations in the last two weeks of the first quarter, as we believe our customers’ focus turned primarily to the safety of their employees and to immediately position themselves to operate under a work-from-home environment. However, since that time, we have seen companies become more focused on the elevated risks associated with having a highly distributed workforce collaborating on multiple platforms. Companies around the world now have employees working remotely from potentially vulnerable home networks, accessing critical on-premises data stores and infrastructure through VPNs and sharing information in cloud data stores like Office 365 and Microsoft Teams. We believe this trend is likely to continue in the long-term and that we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity ahead. Specifically, crises create optimal conditions for cybercrime, and we can help protect data and infrastructure against hackers and rogue employees. As companies and organizations understand that a data-centric approach to security is critical and that these elevated risks are expected to be here for the long-term, we have seen continued customer engagement and inbound interest, with some of this interest converting into new business or the expansion of existing business.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors that we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; efficiency of available vaccines and the availability of such vaccines to the worldwide population; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. The uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic could affect management’s accounting estimates and assumptions, which in turn could result in greater variability with forward-looking guidance. For a discussion of certain risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, please refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).
Acquisitions 
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed the acquisition of Polyrize Security Ltd. (“Polyrize”), a private company which developed software that maps and analyzes the relationships between users and data across a number of cloud applications and services, including Google Drive, Salesforce, Okta, GitHub, Slack, Amazon Web Services ("AWS"), Jira and others, making it simple for security teams to control access to cloud data and infrastructure and analyze cloud activity.
Size of Our Market Opportunity
The International Data Corporation’s Data Age 2025: The Digitization of the World from Edge to Core study (the "Study") estimates that the amount of data created in the world will grow from 45 Zettabytes in 2019 to 175 Zettabytes (or 175 trillion gigabytes) in 2025. The Study was updated in 2020 showing that data created in 2019 grew more than 35% year over year. We expect this trend is likely to continue as more enterprises require technologies to protect and manage their data and centralize data management, analytics, data security and privacy.
We believe that the diverse functionalities offered by our platform position us at the intersection of several powerful trends in the digital universe. We further believe that the business intelligence and functionalities delivered by our platform define a new market. Although we are not aware of any third party studies that accurately define our addressable market, the functionality of our software platform overlaps with portions of several established and growing enterprise software markets as defined by Gartner, Inc. in 2020, including security software ($43.2 billion), IT operations management ($30.9 billion), infrastructure software ($19.8 billion), storage management ($14.1 billion), data integration ($5.5 billion) and cloud access and cloud workload protection software ($2.4 billion). Further, the security software market, which we believe is our largest opportunity, has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 35% since 2018. We believe that our comprehensive product offering will attract a meaningful portion of this overall spend, and we estimate that our total addressable market is approximately 20% of these markets, with the remainder coming from content services and other application software. We have attempted to measure our total addressable market by utilizing estimates from Forrester on the number of companies in North America and Europe that fit our target criteria, and then assuming that each customer purchases the double digit number of licenses that we aim to sell to all of our customers. In both the “top-down” approach utilizing Gartner industry spend estimates, and the “bottoms-up” approach utilizing Forrester customer estimates, we calculate a total addressable market of more than $25.0 billion. Lastly, we believe that the acquisition of Polyrize in the fourth quarter of 2020, which we expect will allow us to expand our platform to support cloud applications and data stores that we do not currently cover, has the potential to meaningfully expand the addressable market described above through the introduction of new licenses in the future.
Our Technology

Our proprietary technology extracts critical information about an enterprise’s data and its supporting infrastructure, and uses this contextual information, or metadata, to create a functional map of an enterprise’s data and underlying file systems. Our Metadata Framework technology has been architected to process large volumes of enterprise data and the related metadata at a massive scale with minimal demands on the existing IT infrastructure.
Key Benefits of Our Technology

Data Protection
Comprehensive Solution for Managing and Protecting Enterprise Data. Our products enable a broad range of functionality, including data governance, least privilege and zero trust, as well as intelligent retention. Moreover, our solution is applicable across most major enterprise data stores (Windows, UNIX/Linux, Intranets, Intranets, email systems, Microsoft 365, including SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, Salesforce, AWS, Google Drive and Box).

Actionable Insight and Automation. Our products help customers identify and prioritize risks to their data and automatically remediate exposures so that they are less vulnerable to internal and external threats, more compliant and consistently follow a least privilege model. Because of the complexity present in even modest enterprises, effective remediation is impossible at scale without intelligent automation.
Visibility and Data Monitoring Capabilities All in One Place. Our solution combines analysis from disparate on-premises and cloud stores and infrastructure and presents them in a single view, even as data storage and user access become more dispersed and complex in hybrid environments. 

Fast Time to Value and Low Total Cost of Ownership. Our solutions do not require custom implementations or long deployment cycles. Our Data Security Platform can be installed and ready for use within hours and allows customers to realize real value once used. We designed our platform to operate on commodity hardware on premises or in the cloud, with standard operating systems, further reducing the cost of ownership of our product.

Ease of Use. While we utilize complex data structures and algorithms in our data engine, we abstract that complexity to provide a sleek, intuitive interface. Our software is accessible through either a local client or a standard web browser and requires limited training, saving time and cost and making it accessible to a broader set of non-technical users.
Highly Scalable and Flexible Data Engine. Our metadata analysis technology is built to be highly scalable and flexible, allowing our customers to analyze vast amounts of enterprise data. Moreover, our proprietary Metadata Framework is built with a modular architecture, allowing customers to grow into the full capabilities of our solutions over time.
Threat Detection and Response
Threat Detection and Response with User, Data and System Context. Our solutions combine classification and data access governance with User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) on data stores, cloud applications, directory services and 
perimeter devices, including DNS, VPN and web proxy, for accurate detection and risk reduction. Our solutions reduce risk relating to unauthorized use and cyberattacks and reduce time to detection (TTD) and time to resolution (TTR) for incidents.
Protect Data from Insider Threats, Data Breaches, Malware and Cyberattacks. Our solutions analyze how employee accounts, service accounts and admin accounts use and access data, profile employees’ roles and file contents, baseline “normal” behavior patterns, and alert on significant deviations from profiled behaviors. Our customers are able to detect advanced persistent threats, cybercriminals, rogue insiders, attackers that have compromised internal systems and employee accounts, malware, ransomware and other significant threats.
Compliance 
Discover and Identify Regulated Data. Our solutions automatically discover, identify and classify sensitive, critical and regulated data to help meet compliance requirements.
Monitor and Detect Security Vulnerabilities. Our solutions analyze, monitor, detect and report on potential security vulnerabilities: helping companies achieve compliance by creating full audit trails, achieving a least privilege model and locking down sensitive data to only those who need it, and facilitate breach notification and security investigations. By ensuring least privilege, monitoring all access and alerting on potential misuse, Varonis enables privacy-by-design on data stores containing sensitive and regulated information.
Fulfill Data Subject Access Requests and Protect Consumer Data. Our solutions help fulfill data subject access requests from file systems on premises and in the cloud. Customers can easily find relevant files, pinpoint who has access and enforce policies to move and quarantine regulated data.
Our Growth Strategy 

Our objective is to be the primary vendor to which enterprises turn to protect their data. In the first quarter of 2019, we announced our strategic shift to a subscription-based business model, which allows our customers to better unleash the power of our platform through faster adoption of our integrated products. That transition has since been completed and, for the year ended December 31, 2020, 99% of our licenses revenues are subscriptions and 97% of our totals revenues are recurring in nature. As of December 31, 2020, 63% of our customers with 500 employees or more had purchased four or more licenses, compared to 54% a year ago, and 30% purchased six or more licenses, compared to 20% a year ago. The following are key elements of our growth strategy.
Extend Our Technological Capabilities Through Innovation and Strategic Transactions. We intend to increase, in absolute dollars, our current level of investment in product development in order to enhance existing products to address new use cases and deliver new products. We believe that the flexibility, sophistication and broad applicability of our Metadata Framework will allow us to use this framework as the core of numerous future products built on our same core technology. Our ability to leverage our research and development resources has enabled us to create a new product development engine that we believe can proactively identify and solve enterprise needs and help us further penetrate and grow our addressable markets. Additionally, in October 2020, in order to expand the Varonis Data Security Platform to cover additional cloud applications and infrastructure, we acquired a provider of software that maps and analyzes relationships between users and data across a number of cloud applications and services. We plan to incorporate these capabilities into our platform in order to accelerate product development and allow us to more quickly introduce new licenses, which we believe will in turn expand our addressable market. We will continue to seek additional opportunities to extend our technological capabilities and grow our business, from continued organic investments in our research and development efforts to technological tuck-in acquisitions.

Grow Our Customer Base. The unabated rise in enterprise data, ubiquitous reliance on digital collaboration and increased cybersecurity concerns will continue to drive demand for data protection, compliance and threat detection and response solutions. We intend to capitalize on this demand by targeting new customers, underpenetrated markets and use cases for our solutions. Our solutions address the needs of customers of all sizes, ranging from small and medium businesses to large multinational companies with hundreds of thousands of employees and petabytes of data. Although our solutions are applicable to organizations of all sizes, we will continue our focus on targeting larger organizations who can make larger purchases with us initially and over time.

Increase Sales to Existing Customers. We believe significant opportunities exist to further expand relationships with existing customers. Data growth (and subsequent security concerns) continues across all data stores, and enterprises want to standardize solutions that help them manage, protect and extract more value from their data, wherever it is stored. We will continue to cultivate incremental sales from our existing customers by driving increased use of our software within our installed 
base by expanding footprint and usage. We currently have six product families, consisting of DatAdvantage, DatAlert, Data Classification Engine, DataPrivilege, Data Transport Engine and DatAnswers with over twenty-five licenses under these product families. As of December 31, 2020, 63% of our customers with 500 employees or more had purchased four or more licenses and 30% purchased six or more licenses. We believe our existing customer base serves as a strong source of incremental revenues given our broad platform of products, their growing volume and complexity of enterprise data and the associated security concerns. As we innovate and expand our product offering, we expect to have an even broader suite of products to offer our customers. Our perpetual license maintenance renewal rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 continued to be over 90%. Our key strategies to ensure a high subscription license renewal rate and maintain our high maintenance renewal rate include focusing on the quality and reliability of our customer service and support teams to ensure our customers receive value from our products and providing software upgrades and enhancements when and if they are available.
Grow Sales From Our Newer Licenses and Functionality. We continue to introduce additional licenses and enhancements to existing products to support new functionalities. In the second quarter of 2020, we introduced a Remote Work Update to our platform to increase visibility into potential security issues related to remote work, including dashboards for unusual VPN, DNS and Web usage; comprehensive Microsoft Teams visibility; out-of-the-box reports for pinpointing exposed cloud data; and more threat models for Office 365. We also announced the acquisition of Polyrize in October 2020, which we expect will allow us to extend our platform to cover additional cloud data stores and applications that we do not currently support. In 2019, we announced Version 7 of our Data Security Platform, which included new dashboards to assess compliance and Active Directory risk and GDPR security risks so that customers can more easily identify critical risk in their hybrid environments, including vulnerable user accounts, at-risk cloud data and potential compliance violations, as well as performance enhancements, such as the usage of SOLR, for faster, more scalable event retrieval and investigation. We also added classification functionality to help enterprises automatically discover and classify data that falls under data covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA. We added threat intelligence to our security insights, built incident response playbooks directly into the UI and made usability and performance improvements. In 2018, we introduced Varonis Edge, which analyzes perimeter devices like DNS, VPN and web proxy to detect attacks like malware, APT intrusion and data exfiltration, and enable enterprises to correlate events and alerts to track potential data leaks and spot vulnerabilities at the point of entry. We also released support for Box events and Data Classification Labels, integrating with Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) to help enterprises better classify, track and secure files across enterprise data stores and to address additional compliance requirements from new data privacy laws and standards. We added classification categories to the Data Classification Engine, to better identify and analyze regulated data related to GDPR, PII, PCI and PHI. We enhanced DatAnswers to address data privacy and compliance use cases, enabling customers to fulfill data subject access requests and protect personally identifiable information. We have enhanced our products to provide even more value to our customers including: an updated user interface for DataPrivilege, additional data store support, new geolocation support, enhanced threat detection and security monitoring and new threat models to protect sensitive and regulated data against security breaches, malware, ransomware and insider threats, and optimizations to make DatAlert faster and more intuitive for security investigations. We believe these new additions to our product offering can be a meaningful contributor to our growth. 

Expand Our Sales Force. Continuing to expand our sales force will be essential to achieving our customer base expansion goals. The sales force and our approach to introducing products to the market have been key to our successful growth in the past and will be central to our growth plan in the future. While our products serve customers of all sizes, in all industries and all geographies, the marketing focus and majority of our sales focus is on targeting organizations with 1,000 users or more who can make larger initial purchases with us and, over time, generate a greater potential lifetime value. Our customers span leading firms in the financial services, public, healthcare, industrial, insurance, energy and utilities, technology, consumer and retail, media and entertainment and education sectors. We also believe our existing customers represent significant future revenue opportunities for us. We believe that our sales model, which combines the leverage of a channel sales model with our highly trained and professional sales force and their ability to support our channel partners to efficiently identify leads, perform risk assessments and convert them to satisfied customers, has and will continue to play a major role in our ability to grow and to successfully deliver our unique value proposition for enterprise data. We intend to expand our sales capacity by adding headcount throughout our sales and marketing department.

Establish Our Data Security Platform as the Industry Standard. We have worked with several of the leading providers of network attached storage, or NAS, hybrid cloud storage, including Dell/EMC, IBM, NetApp, HP, Hitachi and Nasuni in order to expand our market reach and deliver enhanced functionality to our customers. We have worked with these vendors to assure compatibility with their product lines. Through the use of application programming interfaces, or APIs, and other integration work, our solutions also integrate with many providers of solutions in the ecosystem. We will continue to pursue such collaborations wherever they advance our strategic goals, thereby expanding our reach and establishing our product user interface as the de facto industry standard when it comes to enterprise data.

Continue International Expansion. We believe there is a significant opportunity for our platform in international markets to address the need for data protection and threat detection and response, as well as to comply with regulations such as the 
European Union's ("EU") General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). Revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA") accounted for approximately 26% of our revenues in 2020. Europe represented the substantial majority of revenues outside the United States. Although quarterly growth rates have fluctuated over the last few years in our European market, we believe that international expansion will be a key component of our growth strategy, and we will continue to market our products and services overseas.
Our Products

Our integrated platform of products currently contains six product families, most of which contain multiple licenses. Each license utilizes our core Metadata Framework technology to deliver features and functionality that allow enterprises to fully understand, secure and benefit from the value of their data. This architecture gives our clients the ability to select the features they require for their business needs and the flexibility to expand their usage simply by adding a license, and the fully-integrated nature of our products allows individual products to enhance the functionality of the others. At the same time, the ease of consumption under a subscription-based model has allowed us to deliver on customer demand for a greater number of our licenses, providing our customers value more quickly while leading to substantial future license upsell and cross-sell opportunities.

•DatAdvantage. DatAdvantage, our flagship product family, launched in 2006, builds on our Metadata Framework and captures, aggregates, normalizes and analyzes every data access event for every user on Windows and UNIX/Linux servers, storage devices, email systems and Intranet servers, without requiring native operating system auditing functionalities or impacting performance or storage on file systems. Through an intuitive graphical interface, DatAdvantage presents insights from massive volumes of data using normal computing infrastructure. It is also our presentation layer for IT departments, which provides an interactive map of relevant users, groups and data objects, usage and content, facilitating analysis from multiple vectors. IT departments can pinpoint areas of interest starting with any metadata object, simulate changes measuring potential impact against historical access patterns, and easily execute changes on all data stores through a unified interface. DatAdvantage identifies where users have unnecessary access based on user behavior and machine learning. The DatAdvantage product family currently contains 11 licenses, including:
◦Individual DatAdvantage licenses for on premises data stores and infrastructure (Windows, Directory Services, Sharepoint, Unix/Linux and Exchange) and cloud data stores (OneDrive, Sharepoint Online, Exchange Online, Azure Active Directory and Box).
◦Automation Engine, introduced in 2017, which automatically repairs broken file systems and safely remediates exposures, helps customers accelerate the enforcement of a least privilege model by limiting broad access without substantial manual effort or resources. 
•DatAlert. Introduced in 2013, DatAlert profiles users and devices and their associated behaviors with respect to systems and data, detects and alerts on meaningful deviations that indicate compromise, provides a web-based dashboard and investigative interface and seamlessly integrates with security information and event management systems (SIEM). DatAlert helps enterprises quickly detect suspicious activity, prevents data breaches and cyberattacks, performs security forensics, visualizes risk and prioritizes and accelerates investigation. In addition, the DatAlert product family contains Varonis Edge, which was introduced in 2018. Edge analyzes perimeter devices like DNS, VPN and web proxy to expand user and device profiles to detect attacks like malware, APT intrusion and data exfiltration and enables enterprises to correlate events and alerts at the perimeter with alerts and events concerning data to better spot attacks at the point of entry and egress, reducing time to detection and time to resolution for security incidents.
•Data Classification Engine. As the volume of an enterprise’s information grows, enterprises struggle to find and tag different types of sensitive data, such as intellectual property, regulated content, including Personally Identifiable Information, and medical records. Furthermore, content by itself does not provide adequate context to determine ownership, relevance, or protection requirements. Introduced in 2009, Data Classification Engine identifies and tags data based on criteria set in multiple metadata dimensions and provides business and IT personnel with actionable intelligence about this data, including a prioritized list of folders and files containing the most sensitive data and with the most inadequate permissions. For the identified folders and files, it also identifies who has access to that data, who is using it, who owns it, and recommendations for how to restrict access without disrupting workflow. Data Classification Engine provides visibility into the content of data across file systems and Intranet sites and combines it with other metadata, including usage and accessibility. The Data Classification Engine product family currently contains six licenses, including:
◦Individual Data Classification Engine licenses for on premises data stores and infrastructure (Windows/SharePoint and Unix) and cloud data stores (OneDrive and Sharepoint Online).
◦Data Classification Policy Pack, introduced as GDPR Patterns in 2017, builds upon the Data Classification Engine with over 400 patterns for identifying and classifying personal information specific to GDPR and CCPA.
◦Data Classification Labels, introduced in 2018, integrates with Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) to protect sensitive data across customer environments regardless of where it lives or how it is shared. Data Classification Labels allows users to automatically apply classification labels and encrypt files that it has identified as sensitive.
•DataPrivilege. Introduced in 2006, DataPrivilege was designed for use by business unit personnel and provides a self-service web portal that allows users to request access to data necessary for their business functions, and allows owners to grant access without IT intervention. DataPrivilege enhances data protection and compliance by enabling business users to make access decisions based on queries, user requests and metadata analytics information, rather than static IT policies. DataPrivilege provides a presentation layer for business users to review accessibility, sensitivity and usage of their data assets and grant and revoke access. We currently offer DataPrivilege licenses for Windows and SharePoint.
•Data Transport Engine. Introduced in 2012, Data Transport Engine provides an execution engine that unifies the manipulation of data and metadata, translating business decisions and instructions into technical commands such as data migration or archiving. Data Transport Engine allows both IT and business personnel to standardize and streamline activities for data management and retention, from day-to-day maintenance to complex data store and domain migrations and archiving. Data Transport Engine ensures that data migrations automatically synchronize source and destination data with incremental copying even if the source data is still in use, translates access permissions across data stores and domains and provides reporting capabilities for data migration status. Moreover, it also provides IT personnel the flexibility to schedule recurring migrations to automatically find and move certain types of data such as sensitive or stale data and to perform active migrations, dispositions and archiving safely and efficiently.
•DatAnswers. DatAnswers was introduced in 2014 to provide secure, relevant and timely search functionality for enterprise data. In 2018, we enhanced DatAnswers to help meet growing demands to comply with data privacy regulations and eDiscovery requests, and to facilitate data subject access requests. As data privacy laws are becoming more prevalent across the globe, meeting subject access requests is a primary requirement in data regulation. As companies continue to generate and store data in numerous enterprise data stores, relevant files become harder to find and manage, and compliance officers, controllers, and administrators need to identify and locate relevant content related to a data subject. DatAnswers provides elevated search for compliance and e-discovery, helping solve the growing problem of being able to fulfill subject access requests to meet data privacy laws. We currently offer DatAnswers licenses for Windows, SharePoint, OneDrive and SharePoint Online.
Our Customers

We currently have customers in over 85 countries. Our customers span numerous industries and vary greatly in size, ranging from small and medium businesses to large multinational enterprises and government agencies. Our customers include leading firms in the financial services, public, healthcare, industrial, insurance, energy and utilities, technology, consumer and retail, media and entertainment and education sectors, with hundreds of thousands of employees and petabytes of data.
Services

Maintenance and Support of Subscription and Perpetual Licenses 

Prior to our transition to a subscription-based model, our customers typically purchased one year of software maintenance and support as part of their initial purchase of our perpetual license products, with an option to renew their maintenance agreements. These maintenance agreements provide customers the right to receive support and unspecified upgrades and enhancements when and if they become available during the maintenance period and access to our technical support services. Today, with the transition to a subscription model complete, the sales of new perpetual licenses are insignificant and therefore, we do not expect maintenance and support of perpetual licenses to grow versus prior year comparisons. Maintenance associated with a subscription contract is included in the Subscriptions revenue line of the income statement.

We maintain a customer support organization that provides all levels of support to our customers. Our customers that purchase maintenance and support services receive guaranteed response times, direct telephonic support and access to online support portals. Our customer support organization has global capabilities with expertise in both our software and complex IT environments and associated third-party infrastructure.

Professional Services

While users can easily download, install and deploy our software on their own, certain enterprises use our professional service team to provide fee-based services, which include training our customers in the use of our products, providing advice on network design, product configuration and implementation, automating and customizing reports and tuning policies and configuration of our products for the particular characteristics of the customer’s environment. Although professional services have always been a small percentage of our total revenues, we have recently seen, and expect to continue to see, that percentage decline as many of our newer licenses can provide remediation in a more automated way and our planned long-term strategy to allow our channel partners to take on more professional services work. As such, our overall maintenance and services revenues is also expected to continue to decline versus prior year comparisons.
Sales and Marketing

Sales

We sell the vast majority of our products and services to a global network of resellers and distributors that we refer to as our channel partners. Our channel partners, in turn, sell the products they purchase from us to customers. In addition, we maintain a highly trained professional sales force that is responsible for overall market development, including the management of the relationships with our channel partners and supporting channel partners in winning customers through operating demonstrations and risk assessments. Our channel partners identify potential sales targets, maintain relationships with customers and introduce new products to existing customers. Sales to our channel partners are generally subject to our standard, non-exclusive channel partner agreement. These agreements are generally for a term of one year with a one-year renewal term and can be terminated by us or the channel partner for any reason upon 30 days’ notice. A termination of the agreement has no effect on orders already placed. Payment to us from the channel partner is typically due within 30 to 60 calendar days of the invoice date.

Our marketing strategy focuses on building our brand and product awareness, increasing customer adoption and demand, communicating advantages and business benefits and generating leads for our channel partners and sales force. We market our software as a Data Security Platform, a solution for securing and managing enterprise data. We execute our marketing strategy by leveraging a combination of internal marketing professionals, external marketing partners and a network of regional and global channel partners. Our marketing organization is responsible for branding, content generation, demand generation, field marketing and product marketing and works with our business operations team to support channel marketing and sales support programs. We provide one-on-one and community education and awareness and promote the expanded use of our software. We host in-person or virtual Varonis Connect! customer events across sales regions, as well as free, online technical webinars in multiple regions. We focus our efforts on highly relevant content creation, events, campaigns and activities that can be leveraged by our channel partners worldwide to extend our marketing reach, such as, information regarding product awards and technical certifications, security training, regional seminars and conferences, webinars, podcasts and various other demand-generation activities. Our marketing efforts also include public relations in multiple regions, analyst relations, customer marketing, account-based marketing, targeted advertising, extensive content development available through our web site and content syndication, and our active blog.
Research and Development

Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on improving and enhancing our existing products, as well as developing new products, features and functionality. Use of our products has expanded from data governance into areas such as data security, privacy, accessibility and retention, and we anticipate that customers and innovation will drive functionality into additional areas. We regularly release new versions of our products which incorporate new features and enhancements to existing ones. We conduct substantially all of our research and development activities in Israel, and we believe this provides us with access to world-class engineering talent. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to extend our technological capabilities and grow our business from strategic technological tuck-in acquisitions.

Our research and development expense was $99.4 million, $80.8 million and $70.0 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Intellectual Property

We attempt to protect our technology and the related intellectual property under patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting our products. The nature and extent of legal protection of our intellectual property rights depends on, among other things, its type and the jurisdiction in which it arises. As of January 29, 2021, we had 74 issued patents and 28 pending patent applications in the United States. Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2025 and 2039. We also had 41 patents issued and 63 applications pending for examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and three pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) patent applications, all of which are counterparts of our U.S. patent applications. Certain of our patents are owned by our Israeli subsidiary. The claims for which we have sought patent protection relate primarily to inventions we have developed for incorporation into our products.

In addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology and trade secrets. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, service providers, vendors and customers and generally limit internal and external access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information and proprietary technology through certain procedural safeguards. We also rely on invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and others, to assign to the Company all inventions developed by such individuals in the course of their engagement with the Company.
Moreover, we have registered the “Varonis” name and logo and “DatAdvantage”, “DataPrivilege”, “DatAlert”, “DatAnywhere” and other names in the United States and, as related to some of these names, certain other countries. 
In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, we license software from third parties for integration into our solution, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, processes and services. While we have generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, we cannot provide assurance that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available. 

Seasonality

See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Seasonality and Quarterly Trends.”
Competition

While there are some companies which offer certain features similar to those embedded in our solutions, as well as others with which we compete in certain use cases, we believe that we do not currently compete with a company that offers the same breadth of functionalities that we offer in a single integrated solution. Nevertheless, we do compete against a select group of software vendors that provide standalone solutions, similar to those found in our comprehensive software suite, in the specific markets in which we operate. We also face direct competition with respect to certain of our products, specifically Data Transport Engine, DatAnswers and DatAdvantage for Directory Services. As we continue to augment our functionality with insider threat detection and user behavior analytics and as we expand our classification capabilities to better serve compliance needs with new regulations, like GDPR, CCPA and other data privacy laws, and as these functionalities continue to be recognized as critical to protect enterprise data, we may face increased perceived and real competition from other security and classification technologies. In the future, as customer requirements evolve and new technologies are introduced, we may experience increased competition if established or emerging companies develop solutions that address the enterprise data market. Furthermore, because we operate in an evolving market, we anticipate that competition will increase based on customer demand for these types of products.

A number of factors influence our ability to compete in the markets in which we operate, including, without limitation: the continued reliability and effectiveness of our products’ functionalities; the breadth and completeness of our solutions’ features; the scalability of our solutions; and the ease of deployment and use of our products. We believe that we generally compete favorably in each of these categories. We also believe that we distinguish ourselves from others by delivering a single, integrated solution and sophisticated automation to address our customers’ needs regarding access, governance, security, privacy and retention with respect to their enterprise data. There can, however, be no assurance that we will remain unique in this capacity or that we will be able to compete favorably with other providers in the future.

If a more established company were to target our market, we may face significant competition. They may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, larger sales, marketing, research and acquisition resources, access to larger customer bases and channel partners, a longer operating history and lower labor and development costs, which may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. Increased competition could result in us failing to attract customers or maintain renewals and licenses at the same rate. It could also lead to price cuts, alternative pricing structures or the introduction of products available for free or a nominal price, reduced gross margins, longer sales cycles and loss of market share.

In addition, our current or prospective channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with any future competitors. These relationships may allow future competitors to rapidly gain significant market share. These developments could also limit our ability to generate revenues from existing and new customers. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.

Employees and Human Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,719 employees and independent contractors who developed, marketed, sold and supported our technology solutions, of which 755 were in the United States, 601 were in Israel and 363 were in other countries.
We understand that our innovation leadership is ultimately rooted in people. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology space is intense, and our success depends in large part on our ability to recruit, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Accordingly, investing in our employees and their well-being, offering competitive compensation and benefits, promoting diversity and inclusion, adopting progressive human capital management practices and community outreach constitute core elements of our corporate strategy.
•Support Employee Well-being and Engagement. We support the overall well-being of our employees from a physical, emotional, financial and social perspective. We also regularly seek input from employees, including through broad employee satisfaction and pulse surveys on specific issues, intended to assess our degree of success in promoting an environment where employees are engaged, satisfied, productive and possess a strong understanding of our business goals. Our global well-being program includes a long-standing practice of remote working arrangements, flexible paid time off, life planning benefits, wellness platforms and employee assistance programs.
•Offer Competitive Compensation and Benefits. We strive to ensure that our employees receive competitive and fair compensation and innovative benefits offerings, tying incentive compensation to both business and individual performance, offering competitive maternal leave policies, providing meaningful retirement and health benefits and maintaining an employee stock purchase plan. In 2020, in response to a salary reduction during the COVID-19 crisis, we also provided broader access to equity compensation to our employees by granting them restricted stock units. As the momentum of the business improved throughout 2020, we informed employees that salaries would be returned to original levels in two phases, with the first phase becoming effective in July 2020 and the second in January 2021.
•Promote Sense of Belonging through Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives. We conduct diversity and code of conduct trainings with employees and managers to make clear our views on diversity and promote an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals are respected and feel they belong regardless of their age, race, national origin, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity. We also require managers to participate in unconscious bias training to improve awareness. Our customers are located in over 85 countries and our global workforce operates across cultures, functions, language barriers and time zones to support the challenges faced by customers worldwide. In order to support our customers’ needs we have established an international operation having employees and service providers from all around the world, with different language, culture, age, religious, gender, etc.
•Provide Programs for Employee Recognition. We also offer rewards and recognition programs to our employees, including awards to recognize employees who best exemplify our values and spot awards to recognize employee contributions. We believe that these recognition programs help drive strong employee performance. We conduct semi-annual employee performance reviews, where each employee is evaluated by their personal manager and also conducts a self-assessment, a process which empowers our employees. Employee performance is assessed based on a variety of key performance metrics, including the achievement of objectives specific to the employee’s department or role.
•Create Opportunities for Growth and Development. We focus on creating opportunities for employee growth, development, training and education, including opportunities to cultivate talent and identify candidates for new roles from within the company and management and leadership development programs. Employee training and education 
includes online certification, in person certification and new hire training bootcamps. We also conduct manager training programs on an annual basis, which include in-depth managerial and coaching skills, as well as tailored feedback.
•Promote Community Outreach and Support. We believe it is important to give back and promote community outreach and support through corporate giving and employee volunteerism in the communities in which we live and work. We also provide corporate matching of employee charitable donations and flexible volunteering during work time and thereby letting our employees know that we care of the volunteer and charitable efforts that matters to them.
Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized the safety of our employees and business partners, while continuing to support the needs of our customers and communities during this unprecedented period. We temporarily closed most of our offices around the world and continue to comply with state and local requirements, guidelines and recommendations. We shifted from existing flexible working arrangements to working from home on a regular basis, using digital platforms and virtual collaboration tools to maintain productivity and to remain in contact with one another and our business partners and customers. In addition, we have also limited travel to further support and protect our employees. In April 2020, in light of the disruption and uncertainty created by the global COVID-19 pandemic and resulting impact on business conditions, and in order to avoid reducing our global workforce, we enacted a salary reduction to employees (including management) across the organization. At the time, we combined this with a one-time equity grant to our employees equal to the annualized amount of the salary reduction in order to retain and motivate them and to let our employees know that we are doing everything we can as a company to support them during these unprecedented times. As the momentum of the business improved throughout 2020, the salary reductions were recouped to the original salary pre-reduction in two phases. Additionally, in response to the pandemic, we provided our employees a work-from-home equipment allowance in order to allow them to continue effectively working remotely. Moreover, we enhanced and promoted programs to support our employees' physical and mental well-being. For example, we made available to our employees several virtual workshops to cover various subjects, including helping employees to manage stress. Lastly, in order to increase the morale of our employees, we conducted virtual fun days.
