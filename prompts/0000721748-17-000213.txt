ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a company engaged in the business of developing proprietary technology that enables a quick and safe installation by the use of a weight-bearing power plug for electrical fixtures, such as light fixtures and ceiling fans, into ceiling and wall electrical junction boxes. Our patented technology consists of a fixable socket and a revolving plug for conducting electric power and supporting an electrical appliance attached to a wall or ceiling. The socket is comprised of a non-conductive body that houses conductive rings connectable to an electric power supply through terminals in its side exterior. The plug, also comprised of a non-conductive body that houses corresponding conductive rings, attaches to the socket via a male post and is capable of feeding electric power to an appliance. The plug also includes a second structural element allowing it to revolve with a releasable latching which, when engaged, provides a retention force between the socket and the plug to prevent disengagement. The socket and plug can be detached by releasing the latch, disengaging the electric power from the plug. The socket is designed to replace the support bar incorporated in electric junction boxes, and the plug can be installed in light fixtures, ceiling fans, wall sconce fixtures and other electrical devices. The combined socket and plug technology is referred to throughout this prospectus as “the SQL Technology”.
Corporate History and Information
 
SQL Technologies Corp. (f/k/a Safety Quick Lighting & Fans Corp.), a Florida corporation (the “Company”), was originally organized in May 2004 as a limited liability company under the name of Safety Quick Light, LLC. The Company was converted to corporation on November 6, 2012. Effective August 12, 2016, the Company changed its name from “Safety Quick Lighting & Fans Corp.” to “SQL Technologies Corp.” The Company holds a number of worldwide patents, and has received a variety of final electrical code approvals, including UL Listing and CSA approval (for the United States and Canadian Markets), and CE (for the European market). The Company maintains offices in Georgia, Florida and in Foshan, Peoples Republic of China.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 4400 North Point Parkway, Suite 154, Alpharetta, Georgia, 30022 and our telephone number is (770) 754-4711. Our web address is http://www.safetyquicklight.com.
 
Products
 
We currently manufacture and sell ceiling fans and lighting fixtures branded with the General Electric logo and manufactured under General Electric’s guidance. Our ceiling fans and lighting fixtures offer unique designs, and are manufactured with and without the SQL Technology.
The SQL Technology
 The SQL Technology is basically characterized as an attachment fitting plug and mounting receptacle used to install lighting fixtures and ceiling fans. The SQL Technology replaces the traditional mounting bar found in existing electrical junction boxes, converting the mounting system into a weight bearing plug with no exposed wires. Our technology could transform the lighting fixture and ceiling fan industry. Using the SQL Technology, anyone can safely install lighting fixtures and ceiling fans in minutes. Professional electricians as well as “Do it Yourself” installers will benefit from our technology. The SQL Technology is Underwriters Laboratories (UL) listed for USA and Canada, is licensed by GE and achieved National Electrical Code (NEC) (or NFPA 70) status in its 2017 edition.
 
Our SQL Technology is comprised of two parts: a ‘female’ socket receptacle that is secured to existing electrical junction boxes, into which electrical and ground wires are simply inserted and secured into terminals on the device, and a ‘male’ plug fitting that is preinstalled on the lighting fixture or fan. The receptacle is easily attached to the junction box, and any lighting fixture or fan with the SQL Technology can be literally installed in seconds. Our manufacturing plan calls for the SQL Technology to be pre-installed in all types of lighting fixtures, including holiday themed lighting, and ceiling fans.
 
In February 2015, we received an updated Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Listing for the SQL Technology, which expanded the type of products that we will be able to use with the SQL Technology. This listing expanded the voltage and amperage that our product is rated for and will allow for additional fixtures, such as heating elements to be incorporated into our ceiling fans.


We have been working with several well established factories producing ceiling fans and lights in Peoples Republic of China. Most, if not all, of these factories have been in business for over 20 years and follow strict human rights and sustainability protocols.

Smart SQL
 The Company is developing smart home technology applications for products using the SQL Technology called “Smart SQL”, which incorporate Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities to enable remote control and automation of such products and appliances. The Company believes that the combination of its quick connect technology, the inclusion of Smart SQL and its growing product lines will uniquely position the Company in the marketplace.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe the SQL Technology and the forthcoming Smart SQL provides the Company with a competitive advantage in the lighting and ceiling fan fixture marketplace. We protect the SQL Technology through the use of an intellectual property protection strategy that is focused on patent protection. As of July 15, 2016, we have three issued U.S. patents relating to our quick connect device for electrical fixtures. We also have patents in China (two issued patents) and India (one issued patent and one pending patent application), which protects different aspects of the same SQL Technology as the three issued U.S. patents. The Company sought intellectual property protection of the SQL Technology in China due to its current manufacturing operations and prospective sales in China’s market, and sought protection in India in anticipation of future growth into India’s developing market, both with respect to the sales of the SQL Technology and potential operations of the Company. We intend to maintain this intellectual property protection for the SQL Technology.
 
The issued patents are directed to various aspects of our plug and socket combination that comprise the quick connect device. The issued patents provide patent protection for our quick connect device, regardless of the electrical fixture used with the quick connect device. As further innovations are developed, we intend to seek additional patent protection to enhance our competitive advantage.
 
Company Name Change
 
The development of smart home applications into the SQL Technology inspired management to change the Company’s name to one that better denotes the diversification in its product line introduced by the inclusion of its Smart SQL. The Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), and on June 8, 2016, a majority of the shareholders of the Company, approved a name change from Safety Quick Lighting & Fans Corp. to SQL Technologies Corp. Henceforth, further reference to the Company will be “SQL Technologies Corp.” or the “Company”.
 
Our Business Model and Strategy
 
Safety Quick Light LLC began marketing the SQL Technology in 2007 for installation in light fixtures and ceiling fans during manufacturing and as a kit for installing the SQL Technology in existing light fixtures and ceiling fans. The Company sold 800,000 units of the SQL Technology OEM (“Original Equipment Manufacturer”) to lighting manufacturers and retailers who installed the socket and plug technology into their lighting fixtures for sale at retail stores. The Company also sold, directly to the retailers, 100,000 ceiling fans with the SQL Technology embedded into the product. With the achievement of the License Agreement (as defined below) with General Electric, our management team determined that it could improve its gross margins if it were to market light fixtures and ceiling fans with the SQL Technology already installed on fixtures, instead of marketing the SQL Technology as an add-on device. Our management team also determined that it might be necessary to offer light fixtures and ceiling fans under the License Agreement without the SQL Technology for initial orders from big box retailers, to achieve acceptance as a supplier and to provide retailers time to determine market demand for the GE labeled products (collectively, our “Business Model”). During the first quarter of 2010, the Company’s management took the first of several steps toward implementing our Business Model and discontinued marketing the SQL Technology as an add-on device. To support the Company’s marketing efforts to its target market, entered into a sales and marketing agreement with Design Solutions International, Inc. (“DSI”), a privately held, lighting industry design and marketing firm, which was acquired by NBG Home, a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of home décor products, in 2015. In the latter half of 2016, the Company took further steps to bolster its sales and marketing effort by hiring electronic and lighting industry executives, all of whom had previously worked at General Electric.
The License Agreement
 Company management then took the next step in furtherance of our Business Model and sought the endorsement of the SQL Technology from General Electric. During 2010 and 2011, GE tested the SQL Technology and in June 2011, GE and SQL Lighting & Fans, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a trademark licensing agreement (the “License Agreement”) under which SQL Lighting & Fans, LLC was licensed to use the GE monogram logo on its devices and certain other trademarks on its ceiling fans and light fixtures through December 31, 2017. The License Agreement requires the Company to pay a percent of revenue generated on our products using the GE monogram logo as a license fee, including a minimum license fee payment during the term, and in exchange, the License Agreement enables the Company to market ceiling fans and light fixtures with and without the SQL Technology using the GE logo. The License Agreement imposes certain manufacturing and quality control conditions that we must maintain. In addition to marketing ceiling fans and light fixtures under the GE logo and trademarks, the Company has the right to offer private label ceiling fans and light fixtures with its technology installed to retailers that market private label products.

The License Agreement was amended in April 2013 to extend its term through December 31, 2017 and to revise the required minimum license fees, and in July 2014 to remove minimum license fees for 2014. The License Agreement was further amended in August 2014 to, among other things, extend the term through November 30, 2018 and set forth a new royalty calculation beginning December 1, 2013 and continuing through the term of the License Agreement. The current License Agreement provides that royalties due to GE will be tiered, based on a declining percentage of net sales in each Contract Year, paid quarterly, as follows:
 

Net Sales in Contract Year | Royalty as a Percentage of Net Sales 
--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
$0 - $50,000,000 | | 7 | %
$50,000,001 - $100,000,000 | | 6 | %
$100,000,001+ | | 5 | %
Net Sales Made | | Quarterly Payment Due Date | 
December 1 through February 28/29 | | 26-Mar | 
March 1 through May 30 | | 26-Jun | 
June 1 through August 31 | | 26-Sep | 
September 1 through November 30 | | 26-Dec | 

 
The Company is obligated to pay to GE a royalty minimum of $12,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of the License Agreement. If, at the end of the term of the License Agreement, the total of all royalty payments paid pursuant to the License Agreement does not total $12,000,000, the Company must pay to GE the difference between $12,000,000 and the amount of royalties actually paid to GE through the end of the term of the License Agreement.
 
Trade Distribution Channels
 In furtherance of our Business Model, the Company sought to establish trade distribution channels with key retailers. In July 2012, the Company entered into a sales and marketing agreement with Design Solutions International, Inc. (“DSI”), a privately held, lighting industry design and marketing firm. In 2015, DSI was acquired by NBG Home, a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of home décor products. Under the terms of the DSI Agreement, which remains in effect, DSI serves as the Company’s exclusive sales representative for all its products and goods in the United States and Canada. For its services, DSI receives a commission based on net sales. In addition to DSI’s sales and marketing support, the Company’s products will also be sold through GE’s lighting sales group as a condition of the License Agreement.
 
With the recent addition of lighting and electronic sales and marketing professionals to its management team, the Company is further strengthening its distribution efforts to key retailers and is launching a distribution effort to commercial entities such as home builders and hotels. In addition, the Company expanded its target market to include commercial entities.
 
Third Party Manufacturing
 The Company’s Business Model entails the use of third party manufactures to produce the SQL Technology and the ceiling fans and light fixtures in which SQL Technology is imbedded. The manufacturers currently used by the Company are located in Guangdong province of China and, as required by the Licensing Agreement with GE, must be approved by GE to ensure quality standards are met. To further ensure that quality specifications are maintained, the Company maintains an office in the Guangdong province staffed with GE trained auditors who will regularly inspect its products produced by the third party manufacturer.
Line of Credit
 On April 13, 2016, the Company entered into a Line of Credit Promissory Note with a third party (the “Line of Credit”) in the principal sum of up to ten million U.S. Dollars (USD $10,000,000). The Line of Credit provides for monthly payments of interest at eight percent (8%) per annum on outstanding principal, and matures on December 31, 2017, at which time the full principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest become due. The Line of Credit is used to fund the production of our products with our third-party manufacturers and is repaid upon the sale or delivery of the product to our customers.
Management and Personnel 
 
Beginning in 2015 and throughout 2016, we began building our sales and marketing team by hiring electronic and lighting industry executives, many of whom had previously worked at General Electric. Michael Perrillo, former CEO from DSI, joined the Company as a full-time consultant to enhance and expand sales objectives, particularly toward construction/builders, hotels and other sales channels that the Company is targeting. In June 2015, Mark Wells joined the Company as a consultant to provide product promotion and other sale consulting services, and in August 2016, Mark Wells was hired as our President. Also during 2016, we hired a Vice President of Retail Sales, Vice President of Commercial Sales and Senior Vice President or Product Development.

During 2016, the Company continued to expand its staff and team of engineers to develop the SQL Technology and Smart SQL.
 
Capital Fundraising, Previous Offerings and Stock Sales
 
In 2013 and 2014, the Company obtained capital resources necessary to begin implementation of its Business Model pursuant to the Notes Offering (as defined below), and during 2015 and 2016, through additional stock offering and private sales, the Company obtained additional capital resources to further implement its Business Model.
The Notes Offering; Issuance of Series A Preferred Stock
 From November 2013 through June 2014, the Company raised capital resources pursuant to an offering (the “Notes Offering”) of its 12% and 15% Secured Convertible Promissory Notes, convertible into shares of Common Stock at $0.25 per share (each a “Convertible Note” and collectively, the “Convertible Notes”), and five (5) year common stock warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock at $0.375 per share (each a “Note Warrant” and collectively, the “Note Warrants”). On November 26, 2013, May 8, 2014 and June 25, 2014 we concluded closings of the Notes Offering with certain accredited investors (which in all cases herein, is as defined under Regulation D, Rule 501 of the Securities Act), in the aggregate principal amount of $4,270,100. Investors in the Notes Offering also received registration rights, whereby the Company agreed to prepare and file a registration statement registering the shares underlying the Convertible Notes and Note Warrants within sixty (60) days after the applicable closing, and to cause such registration statement declared effective by the SEC within ninety (90) days thereafter (the “Note RRAs”).
Notes Offering Related Issuances
 Pursuant to a letter agreement, dated January 23, 2015, between the Company and most holders of the November 26, 2013 and May 8, 2014 Convertible Notes, the Company issued 2,343,191 shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the following amounts, as applicable, at a price of $0.25 per share: (i) penalties accrued under the Note RRAs, because the Company was unable to file a registration statement and to have it declared effective on time, pursuant to the terms of the Note RRAs dated as of November 26, 2013 or May 8, 2014; (ii) interest accrued pursuant to an Agreement and Waiver, dated December 11, 2014, between the Company and most holders of the November 26, 2013 Convertible Notes, which extended the due date for the first interest payment under such holders’ Convertible Notes for 90 days, in exchange for capitalization of such interest due at a rate of 12% per annum; and (iii) the first interest payment due under each such holder’s November 26, 2013 Convertible Note.
Forbearance
 Between November 2015 and July 2016, most holders of the Convertible Notes agreed to forbear making an election under their respective Convertible Notes until (ultimately) August 15, 2016, pursuant to one or more forbearance agreements, as applicable, during such time interest under their respective Convertible Notes continued to accrue. Interest amounts due through August 15, 2016 were paid in full by such date.
The August 2016 Series A Preferred Stock Election
 In July 2016, the Company requested that each holder of Convertible Notes indicate its election to (i) redeem its Convertible Note, (ii) convert its Convertible Note into shares of Common Stock or (iii) convert its Convertible Note into shares of Class A Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Option”), in each case by August 15, 2016. For those holders electing the Preferred Option, each holder received shares of Class A Preferred Stock on a 1 to 1 ratio to the number of shares of Common Stock which were then convertible as unpaid principal under such holder’s respective Convertible Note. The Class A Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of Common Stock at the same conversion price as the Convertible Notes (i.e., USD $0.25 per share), and pays interest quarterly at a rate of six percent (6%). The Class A Preferred Stock will be convertible upon the election of the holder thereof.
 
Each holder electing the Preferred Option entered into an amendment to its Convertible Note, providing that the Convertible Note is convertible into shares of Series A Preferred Stock, rather than shares of Common Stock (the “Note Amendment”). In addition, each holder entered into a lock-up agreement, whereby such holder agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, give, donate, transfer or otherwise dispose of (i) the shares of Common Stock it then held, (ii) the shares of Series A Preferred Stock obtained upon conversion of its Convertible Note, and (iii) the shares of Common Stock underlying the Series A Preferred Stock (the “Note Lock-Up Agreement”). More than a majority of the holders of the then-outstanding Convertible Notes entered into the Note Amendment or otherwise consented to the Note Amendment, and the Note Amendments, conversion to Series A Preferred Stock and Note Lock-Up Agreement were entered into effective as of August 15, 2016.

Prior to the August 2016 Election, several holders of the Convertible Notes had previously elected to receive payment in cash, or convert their Convertible Notes into shares of Common Stock, but most Convertible Notes remained outstanding. Pursuant to elections received and effective as of August 15, 2016, the Company thereafter redeemed or issued shares of Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, in exchange for the principal balance of the Convertible Notes, as follows: (i) the payment of, in the aggregate, $200,000 in principal balance of two Convertible Notes; (ii) the issuance of 240,000 shares of Common Stock, representing $60,000 in outstanding Convertible Note principal balance; and (iii) the issuance of 13,256,936 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, representing $3,314,234 in outstanding Convertible Note principal balance.
 
As of March 30, 2017, one Convertible Note remains outstanding, which will be converted into 200,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, subject to receipt of complete paperwork from the respective Convertible Note holder. Interest under all other Convertible Notes has been paid and all such Convertible Notes have been terminated.
 
The 2015 Stock Offerings
 Beginning in May 2015, we conducted an offering of up to $4,000,000 of restricted shares of Common Stock, no par value per share, at $0.60 per share to certain accredited and non-accredited investors (the “May 2015 Stock Offering”), and beginning in November 2015, we conducted an offering of up to $2,000,000 of restricted shares of Common Stock, no par value per share, at $1.00 per share to certain accredited and non-accredited investors (the “November 2015 Stock Offering”). In both offerings, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with each investor, whereby the Company agreed to, and did, file a registration statement to register the subscribed for shares of Common Stock within one hundred fifty (150) days after the date of such agreement.
 
Between June 12, 2015 and November 6, 2015, the Company completed three closings of the May 2015 Stock Offering, representing aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $2,269,600, and issued 3,782,666 shares of Common Stock. Between December 24, 2015 and February 19, 2016, the Company completed two closings of the November 2015 Stock Offering, representing aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $800,000, and issued 800,000 shares of Common Stock.
 
The 2016 Stock Sales
 On April 4, 2016, the Company entered into a securities subscription agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which the Company sold 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $2.50 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $5,000,000 (the “April 2016 Stock Sale”). In addition, the Company issued to the investor a one-year warrant to purchase up to 1,666,667 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share. On March 24, 2017, such warrant was exercised in full, resulting in additional gross proceeds to the Company of $5,000,000, and the Company issued 1,666,667 shares of Common Stock.
 
On May 10, 2016, the Company entered into a securities subscription agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which the Company sold (i) 675,000 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $2.60 per share; (ii) a three-year warrant to purchase up to 1,350,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price ranging between $3.00 and $3.50 per share (depending on the date of exercise); and (iii) a right to subsequently receive Volume Warrants to purchase up to 1,350,000 shares of Common Stock at $3.00 per share (the “May 2016 Stock Sale”).


On September 22, 2016, the Company entered into a securities subscription agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which the Company sold (i) 30,000 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $2.60 per share, (ii) an option to purchase an additional 30,000 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $2.60 per share within 90 days (which such investor has provided notice of an intent to exercise), (iii) a three-year warrant to purchase up to 60,000 shares of Common Stock (or 120,000 shares if the option in item (ii) is exercised) at an exercise price ranging between $3.00 and $3.50 per share (depending on the date of exercise), and (iii) a right to subsequently receive Volume Warrants to purchase up to 120,000 shares of Common Stock at $3.00 per share (the “September 2016 Stock Sale”).
 
“Volume Warrants” refer to unissued warrants that will only become issuable upon (i) the Company meeting specified thresholds based on the Company generating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in a fiscal year during the warrant term, (ii) completion of a private placement of a minimum of $15,000,000 at specified pre-money valuation thresholds, or (iii) the sale of at least fifty percent (50%) of the Company’s assets at pre-money valuation thresholds ranging from $350,000,000 to $1,000,000,000.
 
The May 2016 Stock Sale resulted in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $1,755,000 and the September 2016 Stock Sale resulted in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $78,000. In addition, the Company could receive up to an amount between $4,230,000 and $4,935,000 in gross proceeds upon exercise of warrants issued in both sales, depending on the timing of such exercise, and could receive additional proceeds of up to $4,410,000, if all the Volume Warrants are subsequently issued and fully exercised by the holder thereof.
 
Also on September 22, 2016, the Company issued 150,000 shares of Common Stock to an accredited investor, in exchange for $405,000 in cash, for a price of $2.70 per share. In connection with the sale, the Company granted warrants to purchase up to 750,000 shares of Common Stock exercisable at a price per share of $3.00 per share, which expire on January 1, 2022.

Industry Overview and Competition
 
We currently face competition from traditional lighting technologies. There are numerous traditional light manufacturing companies, worldwide, many of which are significantly larger than us. Traditional lighting technologies have the advantage of a long history of market acceptance and developed relationships with retailers and distributors. We will actively seek to educate our target markets as to the advantages of our technology compared to traditional installation methods and believe the achievement of this objective is critical to our future. Although our technology is proprietary and patent protected, there can be no assurance that a large conventional lighting company will not invent a competing technology that offers similar installation efficiencies and enter the market and utilize its resources to capture significant market share and adversely affect our operating results.
 
We believe our products with the SQL Technology can effectively compete against traditional lighting in the areas of installation, maintenance and safety. The SQL Technology offers the advantage of ease of installation and replacement. This feature is superior to other lighting systems, which can require the service of professional electricians to install and remove. Once SQL’s socket is correctly installed in a ceiling or wall electrical junction box, there is no exposure to live electrical wires resulting in an additional advantage in the area of safety. Furthermore, the installation of our socket, which weighs approximately four (4) ounces, requires significantly less work and exertion compared to traditional ceiling light or fan fixtures, which ordinarily weigh in excess of ten (10) pounds and can weigh hundreds of pounds. There can be no assurance, however, that the current competitors directly involved in this industry or a new competitor will not develop processes or technology which will allow them to decrease their costs, and consequently, erode our price advantage.
 
There is significant competition in the ceiling lighting and fan market place; however, we believe we have a competitive advantage due to the strength of the SQL Technology. This competitive advantage extends to customers both in the residential as well as the commercial markets. The SQL Technology is patented or trademarked in the United States of America, Canada, Mexico, Hong Kong, China, and Australia. The Company faces competitive forces from traditional approaches towards ceiling lighting and fans installations. While it is unclear whether SQL’s unique technology will gain significant market penetration, the Company believes that its safety and installation efficiency features will gain market acceptance since it significantly reduces the time necessary to install such fixtures and, after a one-time installation of the socket component, eliminates further exposure to electrical wires when used in conjunction with fixtures in which the plug is installed.
 
To further bolster the Company’s competitive position, the Company has engaged the support of DSI, a lighting design and marketing firm whose existing customer base includes Walmart, Costco, The Home Depot, BJ’s Wholesale Club, Sam’s Club and other major retailers throughout North America. In 2015, DSI was acquired by NBG Home, a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of home décor products. Under the terms of the DSI Agreement, which remains in effect, DSI serves as the Company’s sales representative for all its products and goods in the United States and Canada. For its services, DSI receives a commission based on net sales. The Company’s products will also be sold through GE’s lighting sales group as a condition of it License Agreement. The Company’s recent addition of lighting and electronic sales and marketing professionals will further strengthen its distribution efforts to key retailers, in addition to launching a marketing program to commercial entities such as home builders and hotels.
 
Customers
 
We market our product to retailers and other customers who purchase large quantities of ceiling fans and lighting fixtures.  This includes OEM manufactures, electrical distributors, large “big box” retailers, builders, hotels, casinos and industrial and commercial lighting and fan manufactures. 
 
We believe that this market will benefit from the time saved in installing fixtures and the safety features achieved from the elimination of exposed electrical wires once the SQL Technology socket is installed in the junction box.

Employees
 
As of March 25, 2017, we had ten full time employees in the United States of America and six full time employees in the Peoples Republic of China. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
These salaried employees include the Company’s founder, Executive Chairman and Chairman of our Board, Rani Kohen, who serves as an executive of the Company on operational activities; John Campi, who serves as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer; Mark Wells, who serves as the Company’s President; and Patricia Barron, who serves as the Company’s Chief Operations Officer. In the second half of 201,6 the Company hired three former GE lighting executives: John Poole as Vice President of Retail Sales, David Martinsen as Vice President of Commercial Sales, and Steve Briggs as Senior Vice President of Product Development.
 
Seasonality
 
Retailers purchase ceiling fans for early spring and summer sales. As a result, the Company sells more of this product in the October through February time period. The Company has begun to market lighting fixtures that will reduce the impact of seasonal influences to its sales growth, as lighting products do not lend themselves to seasonal purchases. During periods of economic expansion or contraction our sales by quarter may vary significantly from this seasonal pattern.
Government and Environmental Regulation
 
Our facilities and operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations may impose strict, joint and several liabilities on certain persons for the cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated properties. These persons may include former, current or future owners or operators of properties and persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Our leased real property may give rise to such investigation, remediation and monitoring liabilities under environmental laws. In addition, anyone disposing of certain products we distribute, such fluorescent lighting, must comply with environmental laws that regulate certain materials in these products.
 
We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws. As a result, we do not anticipate making significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current year or in the near future.
 
Emerging Growth Company 
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies.
 
Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably opted out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.
 
We could remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues are $1 billion, as adjusted, or more, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which would occur if the market value of Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.
