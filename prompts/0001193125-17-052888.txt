Autolivs head office is located in Stockholm, Sweden, where we currently employ 80 people. At December 31, 2016, Autoliv had approximately 61,500 employees worldwide, and a total headcount, including 8,800 temporary personnel, of approximately 70,300. 
 The information required by this Item 1 regarding developments in the Companys business during 2016 is contained in the Annual Report on pages 20-23 and 39-41 and is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Financial Information on Segments 
 Autoliv considers its products to be components of integrated automotive safety systems. Autoliv has two operating segments: (i) Passive Safety (airbags, seatbelts and steering wheels) and (ii) Electronics (active safety products, such as camera-based vision systems, night driving assist, automotive radars, positioning systems, brake control systems and other active safety systems, and passive safety electronic products, such as airbag control modules and remote sensing units). For financial reporting purposes, these two operating segments are also the Companys reportable segments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 280 Segment Reporting. The financial data relating to Autolivs businesses in these segments over the last three fiscal years is contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 58 through 61 of the Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference. A statement of net sales by product group and region for the last three years is contained in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84 of the Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Products, Market and Competition 
 Information concerning products, markets and competition is included in the sections Industry Pioneer in Real Life Safety on pages 10-11 of the Annual Report, Innovate for Real Life Safety on pages 18-19 of the Annual Report, Passive Safety and Electronics on pages 8-9 of the Annual Report and Our Market and Competitors and Our Customers on pages 20-23 of the Annual Report, and in the Risks and Risk Management sections Dependence on Customers, New Competition and Patents and Proprietary Technology on page 54 of the Annual Report, and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Manufacturing and Production 
 Including joint venture operations, Autoliv has approximately 78 production facilities located in 25 countries, consisting of both component factories and assembly factories. See Item 2. Properties for a description of Autolivs principal properties. The component factories manufacture inflators, gas generants, initiators, textile cushions, webbing materials, electronics, pressed steel parts, springs and overmoulded steel parts used in seatbelt and airbag assembly, steering wheels and our active safety, vision and night vision systems and our other safety electronic systems. The assembly factories source components from a number of parties, including Autolivs own component factories, and assemble complete restraint systems for just-in-time delivery to customers. These factories also assemble our active safety, vision and night vision systems. The products manufactured by Autolivs consolidated subsidiaries in 2016 consisted of approximately 149 million complete seatbelt systems (of which approximately 69 million were fitted with pretensioners), approximately 96 million side-impact airbags (including curtain airbags), approximately 51 million frontal airbag modules, approximately 18 million steering wheels, approximately 20 million electronic units (airbag control), approximately 3 million brake control units and approximately 10 million active safety units. 
 Autolivs just-in-time delivery systems have been designed to accommodate the specific requirements of each customer for low levels of inventory and rapid stock delivery service. Just-in-time deliveries require final assembly, or at least, distribution centers in geographic areas close to customers to facilitate rapid delivery. The fact that the major automobile manufacturers are continually expanding their production activities into more countries and require the same or similar safety systems as those produced in Europe, Japan or the U.S. increases the importance for suppliers to have assembly capacity in several countries. Consolidation among our customers also supports this trend.

Autolivs assembly operations generally are not constrained by capacity considerations unless there is a disruption in the supply of raw materials and components. When dramatic shifts in light vehicle production occur, Autoliv can generally adjust capacity in response to any changes in demand within a few weeks by adding or removing work shifts and within a few months by adding or removing standardized production and assembly lines. Most of Autolivs assembly factories can make sufficient space available to accommodate additional production lines to satisfy foreseeable increases in capacity. As a result, Autoliv can usually adjust its manufacturing capacity faster than its customers can adjust their capacity as a result of fluctuations in the general demand for vehicles or in the demand for a specific vehicle model, provided that customers promptly notify Autoliv when they become aware of such changes in demand. 
 When dramatic shifts in light vehicle production occur or when there is a shift in regional light vehicle production, the capacity adjustments can take more time and be more costly. Additionally, when there is a significant demand for a given product due to a major recall of a competitors product, such as certain of our customers are experiencing now, capacity adjustments may take time. 
 We could experience disruption in our supply or delivery chain, which could cause one or more of our customers to halt or delay production. For more information, see Item 1A  Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. 
 Quality Management 
 Autoliv believes that superior quality is a prerequisite to it being considered a leading global supplier of automotive safety systems and is key to our financial performance, because quality excellence is critical for winning new orders, preventing recalls and maintaining low scrap rates. Autoliv has for many years emphasized a zero-defect proactive quality policy and continues to strive to improve its working methods. This means both that Autolivs products are expected to always meet performance expectations, and that Autolivs products are expected to be delivered to its customers at the right times and in the right amounts. Furthermore, we believe our continued quality improvements further enhance our reputation among our customers, employees and governmental authorities. 
 Although quality has always been paramount in the automotive industry, especially for safety products, automobile manufacturers have become increasingly focused on quality with even less tolerance for any deviations. This intensified focus on quality is partially due to an increase in the number of vehicle recalls for a variety of reasons (not just safety), including a few high-profile vehicle recalls. This trend is likely to continue as automobile manufacturers introduce even stricter quality requirements and regulating agencies and other authorities increase the level of scrutiny given to vehicle safety issues. We have not been immune to the recalls that have been impacting the entire automotive industry. 
 We continue to drive our quality initiative called Q5 which was initiated in the summer of 2010. It is an integral part of our strategy of shaping a proactive quality culture of zero defects. It is called Q5 because it addresses quality in five dimensions: products, customers, growth, behavior and suppliers. The goal of Q5 is to firmly tie together quality with value within all of our processes and for all of our employees, thereby leading to the best value for our customers. Since 2010, we have continually expanded this quality initiative to provide additional skills training to more employees and suppliers. These activities have made a significant contribution to the reduction in occurrences of non-conforming events.

In our pursuit of excellence in quality, we have developed a chain of four defense lines against potential quality issues. These defense lines consist of: 1) robust product designs, 2) flawless components from suppliers and our own in-house component companies, 3) manufacturing flawless products with a system for verifying that our products conform with specifications and 4) an advanced traceability system in the event of a recall. 
 Our pursuit of excellence extends from the earliest phases of product development to the proper disposal of a product following many years of use in a vehicle. Autolivs comprehensive Autoliv Product Development System includes several key check points during the process of developing new products that are designed to ensure that such products are well-built and have no hidden defects. Through this process, we work closely with our suppliers to set clear standards that help to ensure robust component design and lowest cost for function in order to proactively prevent problems and ensure we deliver only the best designs to the market. 
 The Autoliv Production System (APS), based on the goals of improving quality and efficiency, is at the core of Autolivs manufacturing philosophy. APS integrates essential quality elements, such as mistake proofing, statistical process control and operator involvement, into the manufacturing processes so all Autoliv associates are aware of and understand the critical connection between themselves and our lifesaving products. This zero-defect principle extends beyond Autoliv to the entire supplier base. All of our suppliers must accept the strict quality standards in the global Autoliv Supplier Manual, which defines our quality requirements and focuses on preventing bad parts from being produced by our suppliers and helps eliminate defective intermediate products in our assembly lines as early as possible. In addition, Autolivs One Product One Process (1P1P) initiative is our strategy for developing and managing standardization of both core products and customer-specific features, leading not only to improved quality, but also greater cost efficiency and more efficient management of the supply chain. 
 Autoliv continues to execute its plan to have all of its subsidiaries certified to ISO/TS 16949, a global automotive quality management standard.

Seasonality and Backlog 
 Autolivs business is not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. Autoliv has frame contracts with automobile manufacturers and such contracts are typically entered into up to three years before the start of production of the relevant car model or platform and provide for a term covering the life of such car model or platform. However, typically these contracts do not provide minimum quantities, firm prices or exclusivity but instead permit the automobile manufacturer to resource the relevant products at given intervals (or at any time) from other suppliers. 
Dependence on Customers 
 For information on our dependence on customers, see Risk Factors  Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we lost any of our largest customers or if they were unable to pay their invoices in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and Dependence on Customers under the section Risks and Risk Management on page 54 of the Annual Report which is incorporated herein by reference.
