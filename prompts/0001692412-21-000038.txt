Item 1. Business.
Overview
Playa is a leading owner, operator and developer of all-inclusive resorts in prime beachfront locations in popular vacation destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean. As of December 31, 2020, we owned and/or managed a total portfolio consisting of 21 resorts (8,172 rooms) located in Mexico, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Playa’s strategy is to leverage its globally recognized brand partnerships in order to capitalize on the gap between the 14% U.S. brand-affiliated room supply in the regions in which we operate and the nearly 40% of visitors that come to these regions from the U.S. We believe that this strategy should position us to generate attractive returns for our shareholders and enhance the lives of our associates and the communities in which we operate. 
We believe that the resorts we own and manage are among the finest all-inclusive resorts in the markets they serve. We believe that our resorts have a competitive advantage due to their location, brand affiliations, extensive amenities, scale and design. Our portfolio is comprised of all-inclusive resorts that share some combination of the following characteristics:
•Prime beachfront locations; 
•Globally recognized U.S. brand partners; 
•Convenient air access from a number of North American and other international gateway markets; 
•Strategic locations in popular vacation destinations in countries with strong government commitments to tourism; 
•High quality physical condition; and 
•Capacity for further revenues and earnings growth through incremental renovation or repositioning opportunities.
Our all-inclusive resorts provide guests an attractive vacation experience that offers both compelling value and price certainty, while at the same time providing Playa more predictable revenue, expense and occupancy rates than traditional full-service hotel business models. Generally, all-inclusive guests book and pay further in advance, resulting in lower cancellation rates and incremental sales of upgrades, premium services and amenities not included in the all-inclusive package pricing. 
We have strategic relationships with both Hyatt Hotels Corporation (“Hyatt”) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (“Hilton”) , two of the preeminent globally recognized hotel brands. We believe that Hyatt’s and Hilton’s selection of Playa as its strategic partner in the development and management of all-inclusive resorts throughout the Caribbean, Mexico and Latin America provides us with unique advantages, including the following:
•Access to worldwide reservation systems, global marketing scale, and over 135 million combined hotel loyalty members to drive revenue growth;
•Higher propensity for guests to book direct, which results in significantly improved returns over bookings from online tour operators;
•Lower customer acquisition costs, and higher net Average Daily Rates (ADRs);
•Higher net asset value for branded resorts affiliated with global franchisors;
•Brand partners are a second set of eyes, focused on maximizing returns;
•Immediate customer recognition for a new or converted resort;
•Exposure to new consumers, who may not be familiar with the all-inclusive model;
•Access to guests from different regions, creating a better segmentation mix, reducing the risk from an owner’s perspective;
•Stronger marketing and public relations presence;
•Branded resorts tend to reduce price sensitivity and encourage purchase decisions, resulting in higher revenues;
•Branded resorts, on average, have higher occupancy than non-branded resorts;
•Branded resorts have higher rates of group business; and
•Branded resorts have lower failure rates.
We have an exclusive agreement with Panama Jack International, Inc. (“Panama Jack”), a consumer products company that focuses on resort clothes and furnishings and sun care products, that provides us with the right to develop and own and/or manage all-inclusive resorts under the Panama Jack brand in certain regions. We currently own two resorts operated under the Panama Jack Brand. Other resorts in our portfolio operate under the Dreams, Jewel and Sanctuary brands. 
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed and opened our first ever ground-up development project, the 750-room Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara Cap Cana. We also completed significant renovation work at the 524-room Hilton Playa del Carmen All-Inclusive Resort, 356-room Hilton La Romana All-Inclusive Adult Resort and the 418-room Hilton La Romana All-Inclusive Family Resort during the fourth quarter of 2019 as part of the rebranding and conversion of those respective resorts.
We consider each of our resorts to be an operating segment, none of which meets the threshold for a reportable segment. For further discussion about our operating segments and financial information about the geographic regions in which we operate, please see Segment Results in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 19 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic and the public health measures that have been undertaken in response have had and continue to have a significant adverse impact on the global economy, the travel and hospitality industries and our business starting in the first quarter of 2020. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic for a discussion of the impact COVID-19 is having on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths distinguish us from other owners, operators, developers and acquirers of all-inclusive resorts:
•Premier Collection of All-Inclusive Resorts in Highly Desirable Locations. We believe that our portfolio represents a premier collection of all-inclusive resorts. Our award-winning resorts are located in prime beachfront locations in popular vacation destinations, including Cancún, Playa del Carmen, Puerto Vallarta and Los Cabos in Mexico, Punta Cana and La Romana in the Dominican Republic and Montego Bay in Jamaica. Guests may conveniently access our resorts from a number of North American and other international gateway markets.
•Diversified Portfolio of All-Inclusive Resorts. We currently offer our guests resorts located in four main geographic markets and across a range of price points, which we believe helps foster loyalty among our guests and drive repeat business. We operate resorts under seven distinct brands. Having multiple brands to offer owners and developers is essential to our ability to secure management agreements and attractive acquisitions since having a portfolio of brands mitigates the risks of brand-on-brand supply growth and subsequent cannibalization and expands our addressable market. 
•Exclusive Focus on the All-Inclusive Model. We believe the all-inclusive resort model is increasing in popularity as more people come to appreciate the benefits of a high-quality vacation experience that offers value, ease of planning and a high degree of cost certainty. Because our guests have pre-purchased their vacation packages, we also have the opportunity to earn incremental revenue if our guests purchase upgrades, premium services and amenities that are not included in the all-inclusive package. 
•Integrated and Scalable Operating Platform. We believe we have developed a scalable resort management platform designed to improve operating efficiency at the 18 resorts we currently manage. Our platform enables us to integrate additional resorts we may acquire, manage resorts owned by third-parties and potentially internalize the management of the two resorts we own but do not manage. Our platform also enables managers of each of our key functions, including sales, marketing and resort management, to observe, analyze, share and respond to trends throughout our portfolio. As a result, we are able to implement management initiatives on a real-time, portfolio-wide basis. 
•Strategic Relationship with Hyatt to Develop All-Inclusive Resorts. Our strategic relationship with Hyatt under our Hyatt Strategic Alliance Agreement, as amended, provides us with a range of benefits, including the right to operate certain of our existing resorts under the Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara brands (the “Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands”) in certain countries and, through December 31, 2021, certain rights with respect to the development and management of future Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands resorts in Mexico, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Panama (the “Market Area”). 
The Hyatt Ziva brand is marketed as an all-inclusive resort brand for all-ages and the Hyatt Zilara brand is marketed as an all-inclusive resort brand for adults-only. We believe these brands are currently Hyatt’s primary vehicle for all-inclusive resort growth and demonstrate Hyatt’s commitment to the all-inclusive model. The Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands have access to Hyatt’s low cost and high margin distribution channels, such as Hyatt guests using the World of Hyatt® guest loyalty program (which we understand had approximately 25 million members as of December 31, 2020), Hyatt’s reservation system, Hyatt's mobile application and website and Hyatt’s extensive group sales business. We believe that our strategic relationship with Hyatt and the increasing awareness of our all-inclusive resort brands among potential guests will enable us to increase the number of bookings made through lower cost sales channels, such as direct bookings through Hyatt and our company and resort websites.
•Strategic Relationship with Hilton to Develop All-Inclusive Resorts. Our strategic alliance with Hilton affords us with the opportunity to leverage our management expertise and obtain access to Hilton’s global portfolio of brands and over 112 million Hilton Honors members as of December 31, 2020. During 2018, we successfully converted two of our resorts into three Hilton all-inclusive resorts, with the potential to convert, develop or manage up to an additional eight resorts in certain locations in the Caribbean, Mexico, and South and Central America by 2025. Our strategic alliance with Hilton further diversifies our portfolio, and we believe enables us to reach more potential guests and reduce our customer acquisition costs.
•Advantageous Exposure to Leisure Travel. Our beachfront resort portfolio skews our customer mix to be composed of approximately 90% leisure travelers. We believe that this concentration positions us to recover faster from the effects of market recessions than many of our lodging peers, as historically the leisure segment of the travel market has tended to rebound faster than the business-oriented segment.
•Focus on Safety Measures. As we adjust to a new operating environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have the luxury of having expansive footprints, numerous dining outlets, and predominantly outdoor and open designs at the majority of our resorts, which provides us flexibility to redesign the layout of our resorts with social distancing and safety precautions in mind. Furthermore, we have implemented an enhanced mobile app that incorporates contactless QR codes to augment and facilitate the guest experience at all of our managed properties. We have also incorporated safety practices from our brand partners, government agencies and various health experts to develop our Playa Safe StayTM operating protocols. We believe that our protocols and the association with globally recognized, responsible brands will be a competitive advantage.
•Experienced Leadership with a Proven Track Record. Our senior management team has significant experience in the lodging industry, including operating all-inclusive resorts. 
•Bruce Wardinski, our Chief Executive Officer has over 30 years of experience in the hospitality industry, founded our Predecessor and previously was the Chief Executive Officer of two lodging companies: Barceló Crestline Corporation, an independent hotel owner, lessee and manager; and Crestline Capital Corporation, a New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listed hotel owner, lessee and manager. Mr. Wardinski was also the non-executive chairman of the board of directors of Highland Hospitality Corporation, an NYSE-listed owner of upscale full-service, premium limited-service and extended-stay properties. Mr. Wardinski held other leadership roles within the industry including Senior Vice President and Treasurer of Host Marriott Corporation (now Host Hotels and Resorts (NYSE: HST)) and various roles with Marriott International, Inc. As of December 31, 2020, 2.1% of our outstanding ordinary shares were beneficially owned by Mr. Wardinski. 
•Greg Maliassas, our Chief Operating Officer, has over 20 years of experience in the hospitality and lodging industry. Mr. Maliassas previously served as Senior Vice President Operations for the luxury brands of Accor Hotels in Central & Eastern Europe, Benelux and Switzerland, overseeing a portfolio of over 45 hotels.
•Kevin Froemming, our Chief Commercial Officer, has over 24 years of experience in the hospitality industry and spent 10 years as the sales and marketing leader of Sandals Resorts International, leading the growth of its two well-known all-inclusive brands, Sandals and Beaches. 
•Ryan Hymel, our Chief Financial Officer, has over 18 years of experience working within the hospitality sector. He previously served as Senior Vice President and Treasurer of Playa and has worked at Barceló Crestline Corporation and Crestline Capital Corporation, two hotel and resort owners and operators. 
•Tracy Colden, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, has over 30 years of experience in the hospitality and lodging industry. She previously served as a principal in the Law Offices of Tracy M. J. Colden, as Executive Vice President and General Counsel for Highland Hospitality Corporation, and as Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Crestline Capital Corporation. Ms. Colden was also an Assistant General Counsel at Host Marriott Corporation.
Our Business and Growth Strategies
Since the first quarter of 2020, our primary focus has been on responding to the operational, financial and safety challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and that continues to be our primary focus, along with positioning ourselves to capitalize on what we believe to be significant pent-up demand for leisure travel to our markets when the travel restrictions and public health concerns imposed as a result of COVID-19 recede. As conditions improve, we expect to refocus on our traditional business and growth strategies described below.
    Our goal is to be the leading owner, operator and developer of all-inclusive beachfront resorts in the markets we serve and to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns above our cost of capital and create value for our shareholders by implementing the following business and growth strategies:
•Selectively Pursue Strategic Growth Opportunities. The all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry is highly fragmented. We believe that we are well positioned to grow our portfolio through acquisitions and partnerships in the all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry, such as the acquisition of the Sagicor Assets. We believe that our extensive experience in all-inclusive resort operations, brand relationships, acquisition, expansion, renovation, repositioning and rebranding, established and scalable management platform and ability to offer NASDAQ-listed ordinary shares to potential resort sellers will make us a preferred asset acquirer.
•Secure New Management Agreements. We intend to pursue opportunities to capitalize on our scalable and integrated resort management platform and our expertise and experience with managing all-inclusive resorts, by seeking to manage all-inclusive resorts owned by third parties for a fee and to potentially, over time, internalize the management of the resorts we own that are currently managed by a third-party. We will also look to make minority investments in high return projects to obtain management agreements. 
•Utilization of New Technologies and Leverage of Big Data. We utilize numerous technologies aimed at improving guest satisfaction and shareholder returns. We launched a new website in 2018 using a new search engine and metasearch optimization tools aimed at driving direct bookings, our lowest cost customer acquisition channel. As a result, we benefited from more direct business at our Playa-managed resorts in 2019 and 2020. Our percentage of direct stays increased from 25.2% of room nights in 2019 to 37.6% in 2020 and our percentage of direct bookings, including future stays, increased from 30.8% of room nights in 2019 to 47.3% in 2020.
We also launched a new end-to-end technology at select resorts which uses sophisticated algorithms to identify in real-time what upgrades, packages and pricing to offer guests. This enables us to provide guests with several options to enhance their experience, while increasing revenue post-booking. Other new technological innovations underway include our recently launched travel agent portal, which facilitates travel agent bookings without the additional commission layer of a tour and travel operator, as well as the continued launch of our new yield management system, which should maximize guest revenues by optimizing both package rates and channel mix. 
Additionally, by virtue of our partnerships with Hyatt and Hilton, we have greatly increased our access to member data and analytics with respect to millions of guests, further enabling us to drive lower customer acquisition costs, bookings and revenues.
•Disposition of non-core assets. We continuously monitor, review and optimize our portfolio to align with our strategic vision and maximize our return on invested capital. As part of this ongoing process, we may sell assets that no longer fit our criteria for capital investment. For example, in May 2020, we completed the sale of the Jewel Dunn’s River Beach Resort & Spa and Jewel Runaway Bay Beach Resort & Waterpark, and in February 2021, we completed the sale of the Dreams Puerto Aventuras. We will look to use proceeds from these and other asset sales to pay down debt, reinvest in projects within our existing portfolio or pursue new growth opportunities.
AMResorts Management Agreements
As of the filing date, two of our resorts (Dreams Punta Cana and Dreams Palm Beach) are operated by AMResorts pursuant to management agreements that contain customary terms and conditions, including those related to fees, termination conditions, capital expenditures, transfers of control of parties or transfers of ownership to competitors, sales of the resorts and non-competition and non-solicitation. The agreement for the Dreams Punta Cana is scheduled to expire in 2022 and the agreement for the Dreams Palm Beach is scheduled to expire in 2025. We pay AMResorts and its affiliates, as operators of these resorts, base management fees and incentive management fees. In addition, we reimburse the operators for some of the costs they incur in the provision of certain centralized services. We may also choose to opportunistically sell one or more of these resorts and redeploy the proceeds from any such sales, subject to certain restrictions under our Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined below). 
On October 31, 2020, we terminated the management agreement for the Capri Resort, formerly known as the Secrets Capri, with AMResorts, and the resort has been closed since then. In connection with the termination, we agreed to extend the term of the management agreement for Dreams Palm Beach to February 2025.
On February 5, 2021, we completed the sale of the Dreams Puerto Aventuras, which was managed by AMResorts.
Vacation Package Distribution Channels and Sales and Reservations
Our experienced sales and marketing team uses a strategic sales and marketing program across a variety of distribution channels through which our all-inclusive vacation packages are sold. Key components of this sales and marketing program include:
•Developing programs aimed at targeting consumers directly through: 
◦Our company and resort websites;
◦The Hyatt website and toll free reservation telephone numbers; 
◦The World of Hyatt® guest loyalty program; 
◦The Hilton website and toll free reservation system;
◦The Hilton Honors guest loyalty program; and
◦Our toll free reservation system that provides a comprehensive view of inventory in real time, based on demand; 
•Targeting the primary tour operators and the wholesale market for transient business with a scalable program that supports shoulder and lower rate seasons while seeking to maximize revenue during high season, which also includes:
◦Engaging in cooperative marketing programs with leading travel industry participants;
◦Participating in travel agent tour operator promotional campaigns; and 
◦Utilizing online travel leaders, such as Expedia and Booking.com, to supplement sales during shoulder and lower rate seasons; 
•Targeting group and incentive markets to seek and grow a strong base of corporate and event business;
•Highlighting destination wedding and honeymoon programs;
•Participating in key industry trade shows targeted to the travel agent and wholesale market;
•Engaging in online and social media, including:
◦Search engine optimization;
◦Targeted online and bounce-back advertising;
◦Social media presence via sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest; and
◦Flash sales and special offers for high need periods; 
•Monitoring and managing TripAdvisor and other similar consumer sites; and
•Activating a targeted public relations plan to generate media attention-both traditional and new media including travel bloggers who focus on vacation travel to Mexico and the Caribbean.
We also seek luxury transient business to provide high rate business during peak seasons, such as winter and spring holidays, while “bargain hunters” can be targeted through social media for last minute high need periods. This multi-pronged strategy is 
designed to increase Net Package RevPAR (as defined in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) as well as generate strong Occupancy through all of the resort seasons.
Competition
We face intense competition for guests from other participants in the all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry and, to a lesser extent, from traditional hotels and resorts that are not all-inclusive. The all-inclusive segment remains a relatively small part of the broadly defined global vacation market that has historically been dominated by hotels and resorts that are not all-inclusive. Our principal competitors include other operators of all-inclusive resorts and resort companies, such as Barceló Hotels & Resorts, RIU Hotels & Resorts, IBEROSTAR Hotels & Resorts, Karisma Hotels & Resorts, AMResorts, Meliá Hotels International, Excellence Resorts, RCD Hotels (Hard Rock Hotels & Resorts), Blue Diamond Resorts and Palace Resorts, as well as some smaller, independent and local owners and operators. 
We compete for guests based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, location, guest satisfaction, room rates, quality of service, amenities and quality of accommodations. We also compete for guests based on the ability of hotel loyalty program members to earn and redeem loyalty program points at our Hyatt and Hilton all-inclusive resorts. We believe that our strategic relationship with Hyatt and Hilton, two globally recognized hotel brand leaders, provides us with a significant competitive advantage.
Additionally, we compete with other U.S. global brands that have recently entered the all-inclusive segment, such as Marriott International, Inc., for management contracts.
Government Regulation 
We have operations and are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulation has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods.
See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further information regarding the potential impact of government regulations, including the following risk factors: “We may become subject to disputes or legal, regulatory or other proceedings that could involve significant expenditures by us, which could have a material adverse effect on us.”; “We could be exposed to liabilities under the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, including non-U.S. laws, any of which could have a material adverse impact on us.”; “We could incur significant costs related to government regulation and litigation with respect to environmental matters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.”; The tax laws, rules and regulations (or interpretations thereof) in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change, which could have a material adverse effect on us.”; and “Increases in property taxes would increase our operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on us.” Seasonality
The seasonality of the lodging industry and the location of our resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean generally result in the greatest demand for our resorts between mid-December and April of each year, yielding higher occupancy levels and package rates during this period. This seasonality in demand has resulted in predictable fluctuations in revenue, results of operations and liquidity, which are consistently higher during the first quarter of each year than in successive quarters. 
The COVID-19 pandemic altered this seasonal trend in 2020. See “Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic” in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations.
Cyclicality
The lodging industry is highly cyclical in nature. Fluctuations in operating performance are caused largely by general economic and local market conditions, which subsequently affect levels of business and leisure travel. In addition to general economic conditions, new hotel and resort room supply is an important factor that can affect the lodging industry’s performance, and over-building has the potential to further exacerbate the negative impact of an economic recession. Room rates and Occupancy, and thus Net Package RevPAR (as defined in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), tend to increase when demand growth exceeds supply growth. A decline in lodging demand, or increase in lodging supply, could result in returns that are substantially below expectations, or result in losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Further, many of the costs of running a resort are fixed rather than variable. As a result, in an environment of declining revenues the rate of decline in earnings is likely to be higher than the rate of decline in revenues.
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the lodging industry in 2020. See “Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic” in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations.

Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Corporate Information
Playa Hotels & Resorts N.V. was organized as a public limited company (naamloze vennootschap) under the laws of the Netherlands in December 2016. Our registered office in the Netherlands is located at Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal 104, 1012 SG Amsterdam. Our telephone number at that address is +31 20 571 12 02. We maintain a website at www.playaresorts.com, which includes additional contact information. All reports that we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) including this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K, can be obtained free of charge from the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or through our website. 
Human Capital Resources
Each and every one of our employees plays an integral role in delivering Service From the Heart to our guests and separating us from our competition. “We take care and motivate our employees—and in turn—they take care of our guests with love” is the Company’s official philosophy. We stand behind this statement of taking care of our employees and continuously make their health and safety our top priority, especially amid the ongoing pandemic. 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have advanced health and safety measures already in place and implemented new standards and procedures in order to keep employees at all levels of the Company as safe as possible. Furthermore, new standard operating procedures and daily health and safety screenings are in place which include temperature checks and COVID-19 tests. All resort staff is provided with proper personal protective equipment according to their tasks and hygiene conditions. Onsite medical consultants are conveniently available for resort employees at no extra cost. Additionally, health insurance is offered to all employees in each of our locations, for both permanent and contract positions. Employees that are not needed onsite, including corporate employees, are encouraged to work remotely with additional technical support and resources provided as needed.
To financially assist employees affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, at the request of employees throughout the organization, we established the Ernesto Oliver Lopez Memorial Fund in honor of a Playa employee who fell victim to the virus in 2020. Funds donated by employees and community members go directly to Playa employees in need, whether that be providing food and necessities for their family or paying health-related expenses.
All Playa employees undergo a comprehensive orientation and training. In addition to health and safety courses that include a specific course for respiratory disease prevention implemented in 2020, we offer continuous learning and development with courses on Playa’s culture, vision and philosophy, guest satisfaction, performance management for leadership, mentoring and coaching, stress management, emotional intelligence, effective interviewing and talent development, high impact teams, conflict resolution and quality management. For example, one growth and development opportunity for our high-potential employees is a talent program. Specific individuals are prepared for future leadership positions within the organization through hands-on training, mentorship and education. All of our resort leadership teams participate in our talent program in order to allow identified employees to be promoted at their resort, at another resort within the country, or be relocated within the Playa organization. This program allows Playa to acquire the best talent, retain and motivate its employees, and succession plan.
The Company places a tremendous emphasis on health and wellness. Throughout the year, employees participate in educational health seminars, special events such as Breast Cancer Awareness Month and wellness programs both in-person and online, depending on the employee’s location. An emphasis is placed on preventative healthcare with special efforts including a mammogram truck for screenings and onsite flu shot distribution. Further, corporate employees are recognized for preventative health screenings, reading health-related articles and participating in educational wellness-related challenges that include eating a nutritionally balanced diet and increasing physical activity.
In the first quarter of 2020, our Board of Directors created an ESG Committee which has representation from several areas of the organization to obtain a broader reach for idea generation and to effectively promote best practices and cross-collaboration. Our ESG Committee oversees Playa's commitment to incorporating environmental sustainability, social responsibility and governance into our 
daily operations at all levels with an emphasis on reducing our environmental impact, mitigating risks, improving our communities and driving value for all our stakeholders. Our Board of Directors and our ESG Committee are focused on cultivating an energetic, engaged and passionate culture that helps each of our employees achieve their own personal goals. Playa supports employees through learning and development opportunities, offering a competitive benefits package and spending time discussing performance and goals of each employee and how the Company can support them in their future. Playa employees understand and take advantage of our Open-Door Policy to communicate suggestions and concerns to Playa’s leadership team. We believe that every individual has a voice that adds value to our organization. By listening to our employees, we learn how to constantly improve and make changes to continuously enhance our working environment.
We strive to foster a culture of inclusive growth and provide a respectful and professional workplace to empower all our employees to express what is important to them and to their communities. 
Outside of the workplace, we strive to enrich our communities by partnering with local organizations, volunteering and creating opportunities like internship programs and youth career initiatives. One example of how we care for the communities in which our employees work and live includes the sponsorship of a local school in Jamaica to provide necessities, school supplies and computers, construct and improve facilities, and promote self-sustainability. We also contribute through wetlands restoration, constructing homes for employees, assisting local food banks, and supporting children in group homes and people with disabilities. 
Although our operations are international in scope, each community has its own unique needs, characteristics and people. We take pride in our positive impact and investments we make in our local communities, including in times of disaster and giving our employees the creative freedom to guide our resources and attention.
As of December 31, 2020, we directly and indirectly employed approximately 8,000 employees worldwide, significantly all of which are located at our resorts and regional offices in Jamaica (1,100), Mexico (4,000), and the Dominican Republic (2,800). We employed approximately 100 employees at our corporate offices in the U.S. and Canada. Due to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, we temporarily adjusted our staffing levels at our resorts during 2020 but remain committed to delivering unparalleled Service From the Heart to our guests.
