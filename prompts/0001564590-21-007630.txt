Recent Event 
 
On February 4, 2021, we made a proposal to acquire in a cash and stock transaction Coherent, Inc. (“Coherent”), which had previously announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Lumentum Holdings, Inc. (“Lumentum”) pursuant to which Lumentum would acquire Coherent. Under the terms of our proposal to Coherent, if accepted by Coherent, Coherent shareholders would receive $115 cash and .7473 of a share of our common stock per share of Coherent common stock. We would expect to fund the potential transaction with cash on hand and debt financing. The execution of a definitive merger agreement between Coherent and us would be subject to approval of each party’s board of directors and completion of the transaction would be subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval of our and Coherent’s respective stockholders. Completion of the transaction would not be subject to any financing condition. On February 12, 2021, II-VI Incorporated (“II-VI”) submitted a separate proposal to acquire Coherent. While Coherent has publicly announced that both our proposal and that of II-VI could lead to a transaction that is superior to its pending transaction with Lumentum, it has not yet determined that either proposal is in fact superior. No assurances can be made that Coherent will accept our proposal.

commenced with our acquisition of Newport Corporation (“Newport”) in April 2016 (the “Newport Merger”), and we extended this strategy further with our acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (“ESI”) in February 2019 (the “ESI Merger”).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe there are three secular trends benefitting MKS. First is the impact of a world that continues to be increasingly interconnected, resulting in an explosion of data transmission, data storage, and data analytics requirements, which drives continued growth for advanced memory, foundry and logic chip demand. Second is the increasing complexity of technology transitions in semiconductor manufacturing, which leads to inflections, such as extreme vertical structures and process engineering at the atomic level. These inflections provide additional growth opportunities for MKS as we believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver the broadest and deepest portfolio of solutions. Third is the accelerating need for laser-based precision manufacturing techniques, which are enabled by lasers, photonics, optics, motion, and systems solutions. We believe our long history and deep expertise in solving critical problems position us well to address these challenges for our customers.
 Semiconductor Market  
 A significant portion of our sales are derived from products sold to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers. Our products are used in major semiconductor processing steps, such as depositing thin films of material onto silicon wafer substrates, etching, cleaning, lithography, metrology and inspection. 
 Approximately 59%, 49%, and 55% of our net revenues for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were from sales to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers.
 We anticipate that the semiconductor market will continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales. While the semiconductor device manufacturing market is global, major semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers are concentrated in China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. 
 Advanced Markets
 In addition to the semiconductor market, our products are used in the industrial technologies, life and health sciences, and research and defense markets. 
 Industrial Technologies
 Industrial technologies encompasses a wide range of diverse applications, such as flexible and rigid printed circuit board (“PCB”) processing/fabrication, glass coating, laser marking, measurement and scribing, natural gas and oil production, environmental monitoring and electronic thin films. Electronic thin films are a primary component of numerous electronic products including flat panel displays, light emitting diodes, solar cells and data storage media. Industrial technologies manufacturers are located in developed and developing countries across the globe.

International Markets
 A significant portion of our net revenues are from sales to customers in international markets. For the years 2020, 2019 and 2018, international net revenues accounted for approximately 55%, 53% and 51% of our total net revenues, respectively. A significant portion of our international net revenues were from sales to customers in China, Germany, Israel, Japan and South Korea. We expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of total net revenues for the foreseeable future. In particular, we expect that the proportion of our sales to Asian customers will continue to increase, due in large part to our acquisition in February 2019 of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (“ESI”), as most of the customers we inherited from the acquisition are located in Asia. Long-lived assets located outside of the United States accounted for approximately 28% and 39% of our total long-lived assets in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, net, right-of-use assets, and certain other assets and exclude goodwill, intangible assets and long-term tax-related accounts. Long-lived assets located outside of the United States decreased as a percentage of total long-lived assets in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in right-of-use assets from new leases in the United States in 2020.
