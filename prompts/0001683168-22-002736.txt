ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 15, 2006, as Jupiter Resources, Inc. Our name was changed to Rineon Group, Inc. on April 30, 2009, and AS Capital, Inc. on October 1, 2018. On August 6, 2020, we consummated a share exchange transaction with the shareholders of HanJiao International Holding Limited, its subsidiaries and variable interest entity, Beijing VIE Technology Co., Ltd. (“Beijing VIE”). As a result of the share exchange transaction, we entered into the business of providing health and wellness related products through our e-commerce platform to the middle-aged and elderly populations in the People’s Republic of China (“China” or the “PRC”) through our variable interest entity, Beijing VIE. On October 20, 2020, we changed our name to Hanjiao Group, Inc. The shares of our common stock are currently quoted under the symbol “HJGP.”
 
Beijing VIE, previously known as Beijing VIE Culture Media Co. Ltd., a variable interest entity that we control through contractual arrangements, was formed in Beijing, China, on March 27, 2007. Initially, Beijing VIE focused on the provision of services in paper media, publication of magazines and books, and investment in media businesses. Due to the downturn of the paper media industry and the rise of the elderly healthcare services industry, in 2013 Beijing VIE shifted its business focus to the provision of healthcare related products through its e-commerce platform to the middle-aged and elderly segments in the PRC.
 
In 2016, Beijing VIE expanded its e-commerce operations and introduced its “Fozgo” branded products via its online to offline (O2O) marketplace. The O2O platform integrates its e-commerce platform with physical outlets to connect consumers and merchants in a dynamic marketplace. Its platform not only offers users the convenience of making online purchases, but also provides users the possibility to purchase and receive products at offline service centers. Currently, Beijing VIE’s core product categories include nutritional supplements, cosmetics, smart home products (such as smart watches) and home appliances (such as water filters and air purifiers). Beijing VIE has developed several branch offices with outlets across the PRC with approximately 163,000 users. In 2018 and 2021, Beijing VIE was granted hi-tech enterprise status in the PRC and in 2021, it was identified as Zhongguancun High-tech Enterprise in Beijing. 
 
Beijing VIE owns a 44% equity interest in Rongcheng Tianrun Taxus Co., Ltd. (“Rongcheng Tianrun”), a PRC company. Rongcheng Tianrun is engaged primarily in the cultivation and marketing of Taxus, a type of medicinal plant.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at Room 119, No.778 Tanghekou Street, Tanghekou Town, Huairou District, Beijing and our telephone number is +86-10-63622901. At present, enterprises in Huairou District can enjoy the best tax preferential policies in Beijing. We currently operate 10 branches and approximately 200 service centers, serving approximately 163,000 users throughout the PRC. We maintain an Internet website at www.hanjiaoguoji.com. The information contained in, or accessible from, our website is not a part of this Annual Report.
 
History
 
We were incorporated on June 15, 2006 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Jupiter Resources, Inc with 75,000,000 shares of common stock and no other classes of stock authorized. On March 27, 2007, we entered into an agreement with Ms. Helen Louise Robinson of Vernon, British Columbia, whereby she agreed to sell to us one mineral claim located approximately 30 kilometers northwest of Vernon, British Columbia in an area having the potential to contain silver or copper mineralization or deposits. In order to acquire a 100% interest in this claim, we paid $7,500 to Ms. Robinson. However, we were unable to keep the mineral claim in good standing due to lack of funding and our interest in it lapsed.
 
On March 25, 2009, the Company’s articles of incorporation were amended to authorize an addition of 10 million preferred shares making a total of 85,000,000 shares authorized (75 million common stock, 10 million preferred stock).
 
On March 30, 2009, Jupiter entered into a binding letter of intent with NatProv Holdings, Inc., a British Virgin Islands corporation (“Natprov”). Pursuant to the terms of the letter of intent, Natprov and the Company were to commence the negotiation and preparation of a definitive share exchange agreement which contained customary representations, warranties and indemnities as agreed upon by Natprov, the Company and the shareholders of Natprov, whereby the Company, Natprov and the shareholders of Natprov were to complete a share exchange transaction (the “Transaction”) on or before May 26, 2009, subject to certain conditions precedent to the closing of the Transaction.

On April 30, 2009, the Company filed an amendment to change the name of the corporation to Rineon Group, Inc.
 
On May 01, 2009, we filed a Certificate of Designation to designate 36,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, out of the 10 million shares of preferred stock. These shares had no votes for matters brought before the common shareholders, only with matters regarding the Series A shares where they will be the only voters. They can convert into common but cannot at any time convert to hold more than 4.95% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company.
 
On May 14, 2009, we entered into a preferred stock purchase agreement dated as of April 30, 2009 (the “Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement”) under which the Company sold an aggregate of 36,000 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) to Intigy Absolute Return Ltd., a British Virgin Islands corporation (“Intigy”), for a purchase price of $36,000,000, or $1,000 per share of Series A $0.001 Par Value Preferred Stock. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement dated as of May 14, 2009, the Company agreed to acquire 1,985,834 shares of Amalphis Group, Inc., (“Amalphis”) from Natprov for a total consideration of $36,000,000. Of the 2,437,500 shares of Amalphis held by Natprov, 1,985,834 were converted into Class A Preferred non-voting shares, which were then assigned by Natprov to the Company. As a result, Natprov owned 451,666 Common Shares of Amalphis, representing 100% of the voting shares of Amalphis, and the Company owned 1,985,834 of Amalphis’ Class A Preferred Shares which have the same rights and privileges as the common shares except that they have a liquidation preference and no voting rights. Amalphis’ Class A Preferred Shares were not convertible into Common Shares.
 
The transactions consummated as set forth above resulted in a change of control of the Company. In connection with such change in control, on May 14, 2009, the board of directors of the Company authorized a change in the fiscal year end of the Company from May 31 to December 31.
 
Amalphis was formed in July 2008 as a British Virgin Islands (BVI) Business Company. Amalphis, through its wholly owned subsidiary Allied Provident, Inc. (“API”), offered customized reinsurance products in markets where traditional reinsurance alternatives are limited. In addition, Amalphis was formed to directly sell a variety of property and casualty insurance products to businesses around the world. In September 2008, Amalphis acquired API, an entity that issues customized reinsurance to a United States insurance carrier that offers automotive insurance coverage to drivers who are unable to obtain insurance from standard carriers. API was formed in Barbados on November 9, 2007 by Natprov, a British Virgin Islands corporation.
 
There was no business activity between the filing of the Form 15 on November 10, 2010, and prior to August 9, 2018. The Company had Exchange Act disclosure requirements from January 11, 2008 to November 10, 2010. The Company has no knowledge or records related to the assets referenced above and therefor there is some level of uncertainty in the above descriptions.
 
Prior management of the Company was unresponsive to shareholders and had refused to respond to requests to meet statutory requirements to get current with the secretary of state and with the required filings of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 
On August 9, 2018, XTC, Inc. was appointed to serve as the custodian of a shareholder filed action with the Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada and was instructed to revive the Company. XTC, Inc. was a shareholder of record as shown in the court documents (500 shares) attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report. XTC acquired its 500 common shares on June 14, 2018 in the open market at a price of $0.05 per share. 
 
Enclosed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto are the entire court records, from filing to closing documents.
 
On September 25, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation whereby the following preferred shares were designated the Company and the rights, privileges and designations of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were amended and restated.
 

· | The number of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was increased from 36,000 to 1,000,000.

On September 25, 2018, the Company issued 964,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred shares to XRC, LLC at $0.001 per share and 1,000,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred shares at $0.001 per share to XRC, LLC, a company controlled by Chris Lotito, in exchange for paying the costs to revive the company with the State of Nevada, giving it voting control.
 
On September 28, 2018, a shareholders meeting was held wherein the shareholders gave the board authority to reorganize the Company, including making a possible name change, and/or engaging in a reverse stock split. In addition, the Series A shareholders voted to approve a reverse split of 1 preferred share for each 1,000 shares outstanding of the Series A Convertible Preferred and to authorize a new designation.
 
On October 1, 2018, the Company made filings with the Nevada Secretary of State to change our name to “AS Capital, Inc.” and to exercise a 10-to-1 reverse stock split for the common stock and a 1,000 to 1 reverse of the Series A Convertible Preferred, with conversion rights of 1 common share for every 12,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held. As a result, the number of issued and outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was reduced to 1,000 shares.
 
On December 6, 2018, the Court granted an Order discharging the custodian and approved all actions taken by the custodian.
 
Change in Control
 
On June 4, 2019, AS Capital, Inc., a Nevada corporation, XRC, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“XRC”) and Gao Xue Ran (“Purchaser”) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”), pursuant to which Purchaser agreed to purchase from XRC 11,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company and 964 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Preferred Stock of the Company (collectively, the “Shares”), for aggregate consideration of Four Hundred and Ten Thousand Dollars ($410,000) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SPA. XRC is the controlling shareholder of the Company. On June 13, 2019, and in anticipation of the sales transaction with Ms. Gao, the Company assigned its line of credit and the current balance due thereunder, including all outstanding principal and accrued interest, to XRC in consideration of 10,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company. At the time of the transfer, $48,595 was due under the line of credit. At the same time XRC converted its 1,000,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock into 1,000,000 shares of common stock. Chris Lotito was the managing member of XRC.
 
The acquisition of the Shares consummated on July 18, 2019, and the Shares were ultimately purchased by the following three individuals using their own personal funds:
 

Name | No. of Shares | Percentage of Issued and Outstanding | | Consideration Paid | 
----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------+--------------------+--

Upon the consummation of the sale of the Shares, Chris Lotito, the Chief Executive Officer and sole director, and John Karatzaferis, the President, resigned from all of their positions with the Company, effective July 18, 2019. Their resignations were not due to any dispute or disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices.

Market Overview
 
Home Appliances: Water Purifiers and Air Purifiers
 
COVID-19 had an adverse impact on the water purifier market in China. According to Aoweiyun’s (“AVC)” 2021 report, the size of the water purifier market was approximately RMB 22.7 billion (approximately USD 3.6 billion) in 2021, representing a year-on-year decrease of 5.1%, and the sales will be 9.286 million units, down 8.7% year on year. The epidemic has also intensified consumers’ doubts regarding the safety of their water supply both from the tap and from bottled sources. Notwithstanding the immediate adverse impact of COVID-19 on the market, increased consumer concern regarding water safety together with normal replacement demand is expected to fuel the demand for water purifiers over the next 1-2 years.
 
According to AVC, the offline air purifier market experienced a significant decline during the pandemic’s most severe periods, which decline was slightly offset by a spike in online sales. However, with the improvement in the management of the pandemic together with other factors, online sales of air purifiers in China gradually returned to their pre-pandemic levels while offline sales remained down. In 2021, the annual sales volume of the air purifier market was approximately RMB 6.59 billion (approximately USD1.03 billion), down 5% year-on-year, with a sales volume of approximately 3.83 million units, down 2% year-on-year. However, we believe that increased consumer focus on health due to the epidemic situation together with normal replacement demand will result in an increased demand for air purifiers and fuel the recovery of the air purifier market.

Health and Wellness Market
 
According to the "2016-2021 China Nutrition and Health Products Industry Market Analysis and Investment Prospects Consulting Report" issued by the China Business Industry Research Institute, China’s nutrition and health and wellness industry is expected to maintain a growth trend over the next few years with 2020 sales revenue in China reaching approximately RMB 480.3 billion (approximately USD 74 billion).  Chinese consumers devote approximately 0.07% of their total expenditure on health and wellness products, as compared to consumers in Europe and the United States who spend an average of 25% of total expenditure. Health and wellness related expenditures of urban and rural residents in mainland China have been growing rapidly, much higher than the growth rate of developed countries. We believe that the health and wellness will continue to grow in the near future.
Cosmetics Market
 
According to iMedia Research, cosmetics consumption was not significantly affected by the epidemic. The global cosmetics market, especially China's, keeps growing, and the size of China's cosmetics market is expected to increase to RMB 512.5 billion (approximately USD 80.4 billion) by 2023.
 
Imedia analysts believe that according to this situation, China will be an important production and market of the world cosmetics industry in the future.
 
Smartwatch Market
 
According to IMedia Research, smartwatches accounted for 46.5 percent of total watch consumption in 2021, a relatively large proportion.
 
Our first smartwatch product is smart watches, which are pre-loaded with applications (such as an exercise application, application that monitors heart rates, and a location application) that we believe are beneficial to our target market segments. Over the next twelve to eighteen months, and under the right economic terms and conditions, we hope to partner with third parties to introduce to our platform additional smart products that focus on the health and wellness of the elderly population.
Products
 
We are engaged in the business of selling health and wellness and other related products to the middle-aged and elderly market segments in China. Our core product categories include nutritional supplements, cosmetics, smart home products (such as smart watches) and home appliances (such as water filters and air purifiers). We also sell our own branded “Fozgo” products and third-party products through our website. We are focused on creating our national sales network and establishing our marketing channels to capitalize on our brand advantages.
 
A majority of the products sold since 2019 were “Fozgo” branded nutrition supplements. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, revenues were mainly attributable to sales of cosmetics and health and wellness products, representing 43.7% and 38.8%, respectively. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, revenues were mainly attributable to sales of cosmetics, health and wellness products and smart watches, representing 34.3%, 28%, and 19.2% of revenues, respectively.
 
Platform Users
 
Beijing VIE has approximately 162,100 users as of March 30, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the number of new users increased by approximately 2,600 users, or 1.6%, from approximately 159,500 users for the year ended December 31, 2020. The users are from over 27 provinces and cities across the PRC.

Sales and Marketing
 
We create awareness of our brand and products directly through several channels: conferences and events marketing, social media platforms, and cross collaboration with business partners.
 

· | Conference and events marketing: We have historically relied on live conferences and events as the main driver for marketing and selling our products. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded into holding virtual conferences and events. We anticipate continuing our virtual conference and marketing events in the foreseeable future, even as China’s economy begins recovering from the effects of the pandemic. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Social Media Platforms: We promote our products on various social media platforms such as WeChat, etc. 
· | Business Partners: We actively seek businesses for brand partnerships to cross-promote our brand, products. 
· | Referral and Resellers: We actively encourage the development of a community of resellers and outlets that will be incentivized to sell our products. We expect to rely on conferences and events to develop new resellers and new outlets in new provinces across the PRC. We also plan to attract more new users by using WeChat QR code and the Internet. 

Strategy for Growth
 
The outbreak of COVID-19 that started in late January 2020 in the PRC had negatively affected our business. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic and has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of stores and business facilities in China and the U.S. in the subsequent months. Given the rapidly expanding nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, and because substantially all of the Company’s business operations and its workforce are concentrated in China, the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition for 2020 were adversely affected. In our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we have included a note about our ability to continue as a going concern due to, among other factors, significant decline in our operating cash flows and significant operating losses in 2020 and 2021 as a result of COVID-19.
 
Management believes that COVID-19 could continue to have a material impact on our financial results during the first half of 2022, and could affect our ability to realize certain assets. To mitigate the overall financial impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business, management has worked closely with our service centers to enhance our marketing activities designed to promote awareness of our product offerings and generate sales in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2022. We have also introduced cost containment and staff reduction measures, decreasing our headcount from 70 employees at the beginning of 2020 to 34 as of December 31, 2021. Assuming a significant easing of COVID related restrictive measures, and our ability to recruit, attract and retain key sales members, we believe that we could generate sufficient cashflow over the next 12 months to implement our revised business plan.
 
We are focused on promoting our O2O cloud platform to middle-aged and elderly market segments in the PRC. Our strategies include:
 

1. | Increasing the number of offline service outlets and stores, enhancing the user experience in the O2O business model, and increasing branches across China. We operate 10 branches and 202 service centers throughout the PRC as of March 30, 2022. Assuming a significant easing of COVID related restrictive measures and our ability to recruit, attract and retain key sales members during this time, in 2022 and 2023, we hope to increase our reach as set forth below.

2. | Focus on building “Yiyuan Health care”, a home-based care service cloud platform for middle-aged and elderly people. In order to better meet the health and elderly care of middle-aged and elderly users, we plan to expand our business scope from selling products to health care services (focusing on home care services) in the next 12 months. Relying on the community, we plan to rapidly expand offline service outlets in China through the combination of online and offline, mainly providing home care services for middle-aged and elderly disabled and semi-disabled community elderly care, including home care, health physiotherapy, nutritional catering, remote care, etc. We will also cooperate with many nursing homes, community health care stations, health care bases, and hospitals to provide timely, thoughtful and all-round health and elderly care services for the elderly.

Vendors
 
We partner with various merchants and manufacturers across the PRC to identify suitable products for sale to our users in the PRC. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the major vendors that accounted more than 10% of our total purchases are as follow:

 | Year ended | 
----------------------------------------------+-------------------+--------
 | December 31, 2021 | 
 | US$ | | %
Shandong Kangqi Wood Industry Co., Ltd | | 130,977 | | 42.1 
Wuyishan Zuoyun Ecological Tea Co., Ltd | | 115,516 | | 37.13

Near-Term Requirements for Additional Capital 
 
For the immediate future, we intend to finance our business and strategic plans including possible corporate transactions such as asset or business acquisitions through sales of our securities to existing shareholders, management or employees as well as loans from existing shareholders or financial institutions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms, if at all, that that we will be successful in consummating a business acquisition or that any acquired business will be successful after acquisition. While our operating performance in 2021 was negatively impacted by COVID-19, we believe our business will begin to stabilize in the second half of 2022, and that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed above will be adequate to support operations for at least the next 12 months. We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares and shareholder loans in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our plan of operations.

Intellectual Property
 
We rely on, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect the “Fozgo” brand of Beijing VIE. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could increase our costs and harm our operating results.
 
The laws of the PRC may not protect our brand and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. We may be unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights in our country. Further, companies in the internet, social media technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of their intellectual property rights.
 
We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level of protection afforded by the particular jurisdiction. Initially, we expect that our revenue will be derived principally from our operations in the PRC where intellectual property protection may be more limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection of our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of our findings.
 
We intend to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend to protect our trademarks against infringement and also seek protection of registered design and product patents.
 
We rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. We expect that, where applicable, we will require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. We expect these agreements to provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The agreements will also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of the Company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.
 
Employees
 
As of March 30, 2022, we have the following employees:
 

Senior Management | 5 
------------------------------+---
Sales and Marketing | 5 
Merchant | 3 
Customer Services | 3

According to the Social Insurance Law of the People’s Republic of China, we are required to make contributions to a pension fund, basic medical insurance, work injury insurance, unemployment insurance and maternity insurance for all of our eligible employees in the PRC. We are required to contribute a specified percentage of the participants’ relevant income based on their wage level. The total contributions were $93,916 and $79,100 for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
 
Moreover, according to the Regulations on Management of Housing Provident Fund, we are required to make a contribution to the housing provident fund for all of our eligible employees in the PRC based on a certain percentage of their relevant income.
 
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATIONS
 
Our business is located in China and is subject to the laws and regulations of China governing businesses concerning, in particular labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property. Furthermore, we need to comply with the rules and regulations of China governing cybersecurity, privacy, data usage and regular terms of service applicable to our potential customers or clients, and foreign exchange regulations might limit our ability to convert foreign currency into Renminbi, acquire PRC companies, or make dividend payments to HJGP.
Regulations on Tax
 
PRC Corporate Income Tax
 
The PRC corporate income tax, or CIT, is calculated based on the taxable income determined under the applicable CIT Law and its implementation rules, which became effective on January 1, 2008 and amended on February 24, 2017 and December 29, 2018 respectively. The CIT Law imposes a uniform corporate income tax rate of 25% on all resident enterprises in China, including foreign-invested enterprises.
 
Uncertainties exist with respect to how the CIT Law applies to the tax residence status of the Company and our offshore subsidiaries. Under the CIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with a “de facto management body” within China is considered a “resident enterprise,” which means that it is treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for corporate income tax purposes. Although the implementation rules of the CIT Law define “de facto management body” as a managing body that exercises substantive and overall management and control over the production and business, personnel, accounting books and assets of an enterprise, the only official guidance for this definition currently available is set forth in Circular 82 issued by the State Administration of Taxation, which provides guidance on the determination of the tax residence status of a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise, defined as an enterprise that is incorporated under the laws of a foreign country or territory and that has a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as its primary controlling shareholder. Although the Company does not have a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as our primary controlling shareholder and is therefore not a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise within the meaning of Circular 82, in the absence of guidance specifically applicable to us, we have made reference to the guidance set forth in Circular 82 to evaluate the tax residence status of the Company and our subsidiaries organized outside the PRC.
 
According to Circular 82, a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having a “de facto management body” in China and will be subject to PRC corporate income tax on its worldwide income only if all of the following criteria are met:
 

· | the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; 
· | the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholders meeting minutes are located or maintained in the PRC; and 
· | 50% or more of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC.

Our variable interest entity is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes as defined above. We do not believe that our Hong Kong subsidiary or other affiliated entities located outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body.” If the PRC tax authorities determine that we or any of our subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, then we or such subsidiary could be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 25% on its world-wide income, as our entity in China has been deemed a high tech enterprise reducing the PRC income tax rate to 15%, in accordance with the provisions of the Chinese tax law, which would subject any income outside the PRC to this rate also, thereby reducing our net income. Furthermore, if the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, gains realized on the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares may be subject to PRC tax, at a rate of 10% in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20% in the case of non-PRC individuals (in each case, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty), if such gains are deemed to be from PRC sources. It is unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax may reduce the returns on your investment in our common stock.
 
Value-Added Tax and Business Tax
 
Our variable interest entity is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes as defined above. We do not believe that our Hong Kong subsidiary or other affiliated entities located outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body.” If the PRC tax authorities determine that we or any of our subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, then we or such subsidiary could be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 25% on its world-wide income, as our entity enterprise in China is an state high-tech enterprise, it is possible to be impose the 15% enterprise income tax on state high-tech enterprises in accordance with provisions of the Chinese tax law, thus materially reducing our net income. In addition, we will also be subject to PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. Furthermore, if the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, gains realized on the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares may be subject to PRC tax, at a rate of 10% in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20% in the case of non-PRC individuals (in each case, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty), if such gains are deemed to be from PRC sources. It is unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of our Company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax may reduce the returns on your investment in our common stock.
 
Value-Added Tax 
 The Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Value-added Tax (“VAT”) were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993 and came into effect on January 1, 1994 which were subsequently amended on November 10, 2008, February 6, 2016 and November 19, 2017. The Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Value-added Tax (Revised in 2011) were promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”) on 28 October 2011 and came into effect on November 1, 2011 (collectively, the “VAT Law”). According to the VAT Law, all enterprises and individuals engaged in the sale of goods, the provision of processing, repair and replacement services, and the importation of goods within the territory of the PRC must pay value-added tax. Starting from April 1, 2019, the VAT rate for revenue generated from providing products was changed from 16% into 13%. VAT is reported as a deduction of revenue when incurred. Entities that are VAT general taxpayers are allowed to offset qualified input VAT paid to suppliers against their output VAT liabilities. Net VAT balance between input VAT and output VAT is recorded in taxes payable.
 
Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange and Dividend Distribution
 
Foreign Exchange Regulations
 
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans or foreign currency is to be remitted into China under the capital account, such as a capital increase or foreign currency loans to PRC subsidiaries. Our operating currency is the RMB. the regulations affecting foreign exchange and dividend distributions as set forth herein.
 
In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expense accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible previously. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.

Additionally, pursuant to the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Simplifying and Improving the Direct Investment related Foreign Exchange Administration Policies (“SAFE Notice No. 13”), which was promulgated on February 13, 2015 and became effective on June 1, 2015, the foreign exchange registration in relation to foreign direct investment shall be directly reviewed and handled by qualified banks in accordance with SAFE Notice No. 13, and SAFE and its branches shall perform indirect regulation over the foreign exchange registration via qualified banks.
 
We typically do not need to use our offshore foreign currency to fund our China operations. In the event we need to do so, we may be required to apply to obtain the relevant approvals of, registration or filing with SAFE and other PRC government authorities as necessary.
 
On August 29, 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 142, RMB resulting from the settlement of foreign currency capital of a foreign-invested enterprise must be used within the business scope as approved by the applicable government authority and cannot be used for domestic equity investment, unless it is otherwise approved. Documents certifying the purposes of the settlement of foreign currency capital into RMB, including a business contract, must also be submitted for the settlement of the foreign currency. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested company. The use of such RMB capital may not be altered without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not be used to repay RMB loans if such loans have not been used. Violations of SAFE Circular 142 could result in severe monetary fines or penalties. We expect that our use of RMB funds have been, and will be, within the approved business scope of our PRC variable interest entity. There are no costs associated with applying for registration or approval of loans or capital contributions with or from relevant PRC governmental authorities, other than nominal processing charges. Under PRC laws and regulations, the PRC governmental authorities are required to process such approvals or registrations or deny our application within a prescribed time period, which is usually less than 90 days. The actual time taken, however, may be longer due to administrative delays. If we are required to obtain these registrations or approvals, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to our operations in China. If we fail to receive such registrations or approvals, our ability to use the proceeds from our funds to capitalize our China operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and ability to fund and expand our business.
 
SAFE Circular 37
 
SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as “SAFE Circular 75” promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents’ legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a “special purpose vehicle.” SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Furthermore, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls. On February 13, 2015, SAFE Notice No. 13 was promulgated, pursuant to which the aforementioned registration shall be conducted with and handled by qualified banks.
 
We have notified substantial beneficial owners of our ordinary shares who we know are PRC residents of their filing obligation, and to the best of our knowledge, those shareholders whom we know are PRC residents have completed the registration or will carry out the registration as required under SAFE Circular 37. However, we may not be aware of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. In addition, we do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our PRC resident beneficial owners will comply with SAFE Circular 37. The failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents to register or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner pursuant to SAFE Circular 37 or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37 may subject such beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions. Failure to register or amend the registration may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries or receive dividends or other distributions from our PRC subsidiaries or other proceeds from disposal of our PRC subsidiaries, or we may be penalized by SAFE.

Share Option Rules
 
Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the PBOC on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed companies may submit applications to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies. In addition, under the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, or the Share Option Rules, issued by SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC residents who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (i) register with SAFE or its local branches, (ii) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants, and (iii) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers.
Regulation of Dividend Distributions
 
The principal laws, rules and regulations governing dividend distributions by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are the Company Law of the PRC, as amended, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementation regulations, the Chinese-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations, and the Chinese-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations. Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to set aside a general reserve of at least 10% of their after-tax profit, until the cumulative amount of such reserve reaches 50% of their registered capital. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.
