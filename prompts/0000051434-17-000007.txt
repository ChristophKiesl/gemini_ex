INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY
INDEX TO ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
International Paper Company (the “Company” or “International Paper,” which may also be referred to as “we” or “us”) is a global producer of renewable fiber-based packaging, pulp and paper products with manufacturing operations in North America, Latin America, Europe, North Africa, Asia and Russia. We are a New York corporation, incorporated in 1941 as the successor to the New York corporation of the same name organized in 1898. Our home page on the Internet is www.internationalpaper.com. You can learn more about us by visiting that site.
In the United States, at December 31, 2016, the Company operated 29 pulp, paper and packaging mills, 170 converting and packaging plants, 16 recycling plants and three bag facilities. Production facilities at December 31, 2016 in Canada, Europe, Asia, Africa, India, Latin America included 17 pulp, paper and packaging mills, 68 converting and packaging plants, and two recycling plants. We operate a printing and packaging products distribution business principally through 12 branches in Asia. At December 31, 2016, we owned or managed approximately 329,000 acres of forestland in Brazil and had, through licenses and forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government-owned forestlands in Russia. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions.
For management and financial reporting purposes, our businesses are separated into four segments: Industrial Packaging; Global Cellulose Fibers; Printing Papers; and Consumer Packaging. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Weyerhaeuser pulp business in December 2016, the Company began reporting the Global Cellulose Fibers business as a separate busines segment due to the increased materiality of the results of this business. This segment includes the Company's legacy pulp business and the newly acquired pulp business. As such, amounts related to the legacy pulp business have been reclassified out of the Printing Papers business segment and into the new Global Cellulose Fibers business segment for all prior periods.
A description of these business segments can be found on pages 24 and 25 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company’s 50% equity interest in Ilim Holding S.A. ("Ilim") is also a separate reportable industry segment.
From 2012 through 2016, International Paper’s capital expenditures approximated $6.8 billion, excluding mergers and acquisitions. These expenditures reflect 


our continuing efforts to improve product quality and environmental performance, as well as lower costs and maintain reliability of operations. Capital spending in 2016 was approximately $1.3 billion and is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2017. You can find more information about capital expenditures on pages 30 and 31 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Discussions of acquisitions can be found on page 31 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You can find discussions of restructuring charges and other special items on pages 23 and 24 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we “incorporate by reference” certain information in parts of other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC permits us to disclose important information by referring to it in that manner. Please refer to such information. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, along with all other reports and any amendments thereto filed with or furnished to the SEC, are publicly available free of charge on the Investor Relations section of our Internet Web site at www.internationalpaper.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The information contained on or connected to our Web site is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we filed with or furnished to the SEC.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
The financial information concerning segments is set forth in Note 19 Financial Information by Industry Segment and Geographic Area on pages 79 through 81 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. OPERATIONS
The financial information concerning international and U.S. operations and export sales is set forth in Note 19 Financial Information by Industry Segment and Geographic Area on page 81 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
COMPETITION AND COSTS
The markets in the pulp, paper and packaging product lines are large and fragmented. The major markets, both U.S. and non-U.S., in which the Company sells its principal products are very competitive. Our products 


1

compete with similar products produced by other forest products companies. We also compete, in some instances, with companies in other industries and against substitutes for wood-fiber products.
Many factors influence the Company’s competitive position, including price, cost, product quality and services. You can find more information about the impact of these factors on operating profits on pages 18 through 30 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You can find information about the Company’s manufacturing capacities on page A-4 of Appendix II.


MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
The Company sells products directly to end users and converters, as well as through agents, resellers and paper distributors.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Company operates its primary research and development center in Loveland, Ohio, as well as several other product development facilities, including the Global Cellulose Fibers technology center in Federal Way, Washington that was acquired in 2016. Additionally, the Company has an interest in ArborGen, Inc., a joint venture with certain other forest products companies.
We direct research and development activities to short-term, long-term and technical assistance needs of customers and operating divisions, and to process, equipment and product innovations. Activities include product development within the operating divisions; studies on innovation and improvement of pulping, bleaching, chemical recovery, papermaking, converting and coating processes; packaging design and materials development; mechanical packaging systems, environmentally sensitive printing inks and reduction of environmental discharges; re-use of raw materials in manufacturing processes; recycling of consumer and packaging paper products; energy conservation; applications of computer controls to manufacturing operations; innovations and improvement of products; and development of various new products. Our development efforts specifically address product safety as well as the minimization of solid waste. The cost to the Company of its research and development operations was $20 million in 2016, $27 million in 2015, and $16 million in 2014.
We own numerous patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights relating to our products and to the processes for their production. We also license intellectual property rights to and from others where advantageous or necessary. Many of the manufacturing processes are among our trade secrets. Some of our products are covered by U.S. and non-U.S. patents and are sold under well known trademarks. We derive a competitive advantage by protecting our trade secrets, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and by using them as required to support our businesses.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
International Paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally. Our continuing objectives include: (1) controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air, water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment, and (2) maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company spent $83 million in 2016 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water, and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste. The 2016 spend 


included costs associated with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Boiler MACT (maximum achievable control technology) regulations. We expect to spend $111 million in 2017 for environmental capital projects. Capital expenditures for 2018 environmental projects are anticipated to be approximately $54 million. Capital expenditures for 2019 environmental projects are estimated to be $51 million. On January 31, 2013, EPA issued the final suite of Boiler MACT regulations. These regulations require owners of specified boilers to meet revised air emissions standards for certain substances. Several lawsuits have been filed to challenge all or portions of the Boiler MACT regulations. On December 23, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the Boiler MACT regulations to EPA requiring the agency to revise emission standards for boiler subcategories that had been affected by flawed calculations. The Court determined that the existing MACT standards should remain in place while the revised standards are being developed, but did not establish a deadline for EPA to complete the rulemaking. As such, the projected capital expenditures for environmental projects represent our current best estimate of future expenditures with the recognition that the Boiler MACT regulations could change as a result of new, revised standards. 
Amendments lowering National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate (PM2.5), and ozone have been finalized in recent years but to date have not had a material impact on the Company.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change refers to any significant change in the measure of the earth’s climatic conditions such as temperature, precipitation, or winds that persist for decades or longer. Climate change can be caused by natural factors, such as changes in the sun’s intensity and ocean circulation, and human activities can also affect the composition of the earth’s atmosphere, such as from the burning of fossil fuels. In an effort to mitigate the potential of climate change impacts from human activities, various international, national and sub-national (regional, state and local) governmental actions have been undertaken. Presently, these efforts have not materially impacted International Paper, but such efforts may have a material impact on the Company in the future.
International Efforts
A successor program to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016 which continued international efforts and voluntary commitments toward reducing Greenhouse gasses (GHGs). Consistent with this objective, participating 


3

countries aim to balance GHG emissions generation and removal in the second half of this century, or in effect achieve a net-zero global GHG emissions. As part of the Paris agreement, many countries, including the U.S. and EU member states, established non-binding emissions reduction targets. The U.S non-binding commitment is for GHG emissions to be 7% below 2005 GHG emissions levels by 2020 and 26% to 28% below by 2025. Other countries in which we do business made similar non-binding commitments. The Company’s voluntary GHG reductions, which are set out in the annual Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) report, are roughly in line with the percentages of the U.S. target reductions. It is not clear at this time what, if any, further reductions by the Company might be required by the countries in which we operate. Due to this uncertainty, it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impacts of agreements on the Company.
To assist member countries in meeting obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU established and continues to operate an Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Currently, we have two sites directly subject to regulation under Phase III of the EU ETS, one in Poland and one in France. Other sites that we operate in the EU experience indirect impacts of the EU ETS through purchased power pricing. Neither the direct nor indirect impacts of the EU ETS have been material to the Company, but they could be material to the Company in the future depending on how the Paris Agreement non-binding commitments or allocation of and market prices for GHG credits under existing rules evolve over the coming years.
National Efforts
In the U.S., the 1997 Kyoto Protocol was not ratified and Congress has not passed GHG legislation. EPA however has enacted regulations to: (i) control GHGs from mobile sources by adopting transportation fuel efficiency standards; (ii) control GHG emissions from new Electric Generating Units (EGUs), (iii) require reporting of GHGs from sources of GHGs greater than 25,000 tons per year, (iv) in 2015, require states to develop plans to reduce GHGs from utility electric generating units (EGUs) and (v) in 2016 EPA took the first steps in the process of developing emissions standards for existing sources in the oil and gas sector. The EPA has not yet identified the pulp and paper industry in the sectors to be covered by new standards. However, we anticipate that at some future time pulp and paper sources may be subject to new GHG NSPS rules. It is unclear what impacts, if any, future GHG NSPS rules will have on the Company’s operations.
In 2015, EPA promulgated the Clean Power Plan (CPP) rule to address climate change by reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) and other designated greenhouse gas pollutant emissions from utility EGUs. In response, 


states are to develop and begin implementing programs to reduce GHGs from EGUs by about 32 percent by the 2022 to 2033 timeframe as compared to 2005 baseline levels. These plans, if implemented could pose potential cost increases for electricity purchased by the Company. The magnitude of cost increases to the Company, if any, are not possible to estimate reliably at this time. Adding to the uncertainty, states and some industry parties have filed lawsuits challenging the rule, and on February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the Clean Power Plan.  The stay will remain in effect until final disposition of the case, and as such, the rule’s potential impact on the Company remains unclear.
State, Regional and Local Measures
A few U.S. states have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of GHGs by companies and public utilities, primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. California has already enacted such a program and similar actions are being considered by Oregon. The Company does not have any sites currently subject to California's GHG regulatory plan and since the Oregon program is still being developed, it is too early to know how or if Company owned sites in Oregon may be affected. There may be indirect impacts from changing input costs (such as electricity) at some of our California converting operations but these have yet to manifest themselves in material impacts. Although we are monitoring proposed programs in other states, it is unclear what impacts, if any, state-level GHG rules will have on the Company’s operations. Further state measures are under substantive review as they respond to EPA’s 2015 Clean Power Plan and develop an implementation plan over the next 1 to 3 years. The CPP allows significant flexibility in how states develop their plans, so the uncertainty regarding potential impacts will remain high until more specificity is reached and individual power companies develop their compliance strategies.
Summary
Regulation of GHGs continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business. While it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding GHGs and climate change, any material impact to the company is not likely to occur before 2020 and at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate Company costs of compliance with rules that have not yet been adopted or implemented and may not be adopted or implemented in the future. In addition to possible direct impacts, future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on International Paper, such as higher prices for transportation, energy and other inputs, as well as more protracted air permitting processes, 


4

causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects. International Paper has controls and procedures in place to stay informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the U.S. and in other countries where we operate. We regularly assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the Company, its operations or financial condition, and whether we have any related disclosure obligations.
Additional information regarding climate change and International Paper is available in our 2015 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) report found at http://www.internationalpaper.com/docs/default-source/english/sustainability/2015-gri-report.pdf?sfvrsn=26 though this information is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the SEC.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2016, we have approximately 55,000 employees, nearly 36,000 of whom are located in the United States. Of the U.S. employees, approximately 25,000 are hourly, with unions representing approximately 15,000 employees. Approximately 11,500 of this number are represented by the United Steelworkers union (USW).
International Paper, the USW, and several other unions have entered into two master agreements covering various mills and converting facilities. These master agreements cover several specific items, including wages, select benefit programs, successorship, employment security, and health and safety. Individual facilities continue to have local agreements for other subjects not covered by the master agreements. If local facility agreements are not successfully negotiated at the time of expiration, under the terms of the master agreements the local contracts will automatically renew with the same terms in effect. The mill master agreement covers 19 of our U.S. pulp, paper, and packaging mills; the converting agreement includes 61 of our converting facilities. In addition, International Paper is party to a master agreement with District Council 2, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, covering 13 additional converting facilities. 
During 2016, local labor agreements were negotiated at four mills and 13 converting facilities. Two of these were locations not covered by a master agreement. In 2017, local labor agreements are scheduled to be negotiated at 24 facilities, including seven mills and 17 converting facilities. 23 of these agreements will automatically renew under the terms of the applicable master agreement if new agreements are not reached.
