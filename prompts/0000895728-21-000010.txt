ITEM 1. BUSINESS
We are a leading North American energy infrastructure company. We safely and reliably deliver the energy people need and want to fuel quality of life. Our core businesses include Liquids Pipelines, which transports approximately 25% of the crude oil produced in North America; Gas Transmission and Midstream, which transports approximately 20% of the natural gas consumed in the US; Gas Distribution and Storage, which serves approximately 75% of Ontario residents via approximately 3.8 million meter connections; and Renewable Power Generation, which generates approximately 1,750 megawatts (MW) of net renewable power in North America and Europe. Our common shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol ENB. We were incorporated on April 13, 1970 under the Companies Ordinance of the Northwest Territories and were continued under the Canada Business Corporations Act on December 15, 1987.
A more detailed description of each of our businesses and underlying assets is provided below under Business Segments.
CORPORATE VISION AND STRATEGY
VISION
Our vision is to be the leading energy infrastructure company in North America. In pursuing this vision, we play a critical role in enabling the economic well-being of North Americans who depend on access to affordable and reliable energy. Our unparalleled infrastructure franchises transport, distribute and generate energy, and our primary purpose is to fuel quality of life by delivering the energy North Americans need and want, in the safest and most responsible way possible.
Our investor value proposition is founded on our ability to deliver predictable cash flows and a growing stream of dividends year-over-year through investment in and efficient operation of, energy infrastructure assets that are strategically positioned between key supply basins and strong demand-pull markets. Our assets are underpinned by long-term contracts, regulated cost-of-service tolling frameworks and other low-risk commercial arrangements. Among our peers, we strive to be a leader in several key areas that create sustainable comparative advantage and value for shareholders including: worker and public safety; Environment, Social and Governance (ESG); stakeholder relations; customer service; community investment; and employee satisfaction.
STRATEGY
An in-depth understanding of energy supply and demand fundamentals coupled with disciplined capital allocation principles has helped us become an industry leader supported by a diverse set of assets across the energy system. These assets have reliably generated resilient cash flows amid many commodity and economic cycles, including the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing economic and energy market disruption whereby we exceeded the mid-point of our 2020 financial guidance range. Given its success, this comprehensive approach will continue to underpin our investment decisions moving forward.
In addition to resiliency, sustainable growth is a hallmark of our investor value proposition. We see a 5-7% growth rate through 2023 underpinned by opportunities to generate returns in our base business and grow the business through disciplined capital deployment. Our diversified footprint allows for selective investment in not only our core businesses, but new emerging platforms driven by the on-going energy transition such as carbon capture, sequestration and storage, hydrogen and renewable natural gas (RNG). We have successfully implemented this diversified approach and have seen opportunity in transition throughout our history, as evidenced by the emergence of our Gas Transmission and Midstream and Renewable Power Generation businesses over time.
ESG leadership is an important element of our strategy. Our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint, building lasting relationships in the communities we serve and promoting equality, inclusiveness and transparency play a role in our ability to operate our assets and thus generate cashflow over the long term. Our ESG performance is consistently ranked in the top tier of our sector. 
In 2020, we progressed several of our strategic priorities. For example: 
•Our Liquids Pipelines team secured all remaining permits for the Line 3 Replacement Program and began construction on the final Minnesota leg required to restore the original line capacity of 760 thousand barrels per day (kbpd);
•Our Gas Transmission and Midstream business successfully completed three rate settlements that will contribute an additional $160 million of annual EBITDA together with modernization enhancements that increased the longevity of the system;
•Our Gas Distribution and Storage utility added 43 thousand new customers, completed $500 million of growth capital projects and progressed investments in RNG and hydrogen infrastructure; 
•Our Renewable Power Generation business continued to grow its European offshore wind sector as evidenced by the start of construction of the 480 MW Saint Nazaire project and the 500 MW Fécamp project;
•We committed to environmental goals that include a 35% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity from our operations by 2030 and net zero GHG emissions by 2050. We also set goals to increase representation of diverse groups within our workforce by 2025, including the acceleration of existing goals; and
•We sold $400 million of assets, further strengthening our Balance Sheet and financial flexibility. We also reduced operating costs by $300 million, increasing our profitability and competitiveness.
These achievements are discussed in further detail in Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Looking ahead, our near-term strategic priorities remain similar to years past. As always, proactively advancing the safety of communities, and protecting the environment, will always be our top priority. We are focused on enhancing the value of our existing assets in Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission and Midstream, Gas Distribution and Storage and Renewable Power Generation and executing on our secured capital program. 
We will continue to capitalize on our liquids and natural gas pipeline infrastructure toward export-driven opportunities and focus on in-franchise growth in our gas utility as well as low carbon opportunities. Our Renewable Power Generation business, anchored by investments in contracted offshore wind power, compliments our low risk business model and supports our increasing focus on the energy transition. We will continue to invest in renewable power generation where we can achieve attractive risk adjusted returns. 
Our key strategic priorities are summarized below:
Ensure Safe Reliable Operations
Safety and operational reliability remain the foundation of our strategy. Our commitment to safety and operational reliability means achieving and maintaining industry leadership in safety (process, public and personal) and ensuring the reliability and integrity of the systems we operate, in order to generate, transport and deliver energy while protecting people and the environment. 
Enhance Returns from our Base Businesses
A key priority is to drive growth through an ongoing focus on optimization, productivity and efficiency across all our businesses. Examples include throughput enhancements on our liquids system from the application of drag-reducing agents and improvements in scheduling logistics at our terminals, revenue optimization through negotiated toll settlements or rate cases, ongoing synergy capture following our utility merger and, more generally, creating sustainable cost savings across the organization through process improvement and/or system enhancements. 
Execute the Capital Program and Grow Core Business 
Successful project execution is integral to our financial performance and to the strategic positioning of our business over the long-term. Our ongoing objective is to deliver our slate of secured projects (currently $16 billion) at the lowest practical cost while maintaining the highest standards for safety, quality, customer satisfaction and environmental and regulatory compliance. For a discussion of our current portfolio of capital projects, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.
In seeking to extend growth, we expect to have sufficient self-funding capacity, post completion of our secured capital program, to invest $5 to $6 billion per year in new organic growth capital without issuing any additional common equity and maintaining key credit metrics within planning parameters and targets established with credit rating agencies. We will remain disciplined and deploy capital towards the best uses, prioritizing balance sheet strength, investment in low capital intensity growth and regulated utility or utility-like projects. We will carefully deploy our remaining investable capacity to the most value enhancing opportunities including further organic growth and potential for share buybacks. 
Looking ahead, we see strong utilization of our existing network and opportunities for future growth within each of our four core businesses. For example:
•Our liquids pipelines infrastructure will remain a vital connection between key supply basins and demand-pull markets, while a growing export market represents an opportunity to expand US Gulf Coast presence;
•Our natural gas pipelines business will seek extension and expansion opportunities driven by new load demand from gas-fired power generation, industrial growth and coastal liquefaction plants;
•Our gas distribution utility will continue to grow through customer additions, expansion of existing facilities and storage, reducing operating costs and blending hydrogen and RNG into its gas supply mix; and
•Our growing capabilities in the offshore wind sector positions us well for continued growth, while self-powering of existing pipeline compressor stations represents a large opportunity.
Maintain Financial Strength and Flexibility 
The maintenance of our financial strength is critical to our strategy. Our financing strategies are designed to retain strong, investment-grade credit ratings to ensure that we have the financial capacity to meet our capital funding needs and the flexibility to manage capital market disruptions and respond to opportunities as they arise. Our current secured capital program, which extends to 2023, can be readily financed through internally generated cash flow and available balance sheet capacity without issuance of additional common equity and we will seek to secure new growth using this “self-funded” equity model. For further discussion on our financing strategies, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Disciplined Capital Allocation 
We assess the latest fundamental trends, monitor the business landscape and proactively conduct business development activities with the goal of identifying an industry-leading opportunity set for capital deployment. Opportunities are screened, analyzed and assessed using a disciplined investment framework with the objective of ensuring effective deployment of capital to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while maintaining our low-risk “utility-like” business model.
All projects are evaluated based on their potential to advance our strategy, contain risk and create additional financial flexibility. Our primary emphasis in the near-term is on low capital intensity projects, modernization of our systems and utility rate-based investments. Execution risk remains high for large scale, long-duration development projects and, therefore, our focus will be on projects where we can carefully manage at-risk capital during the permitting and construction phases. 
In evaluating typical investment opportunities, we also consider other potential capital allocation choices that may add value. Other potential choices for capital deployment will depend on our current outlook and the size of our existing capital project backlog and could include dividend increases, further debt reduction or share re-purchases. 
Adapt to Energy Transition Over Time
As the global population grows and standards of living continue to improve around the world, more energy will be needed. At the same time, our society increasingly recognizes the impacts of energy consumption on the world’s climate. Accordingly, energy systems are being reshaped as industry participants, regulators and consumers seek to balance competing objectives. As a diversified energy infrastructure company, we are well positioned to play a key role in the transition to a low-carbon economy while at the same time working to reduce our own emissions intensity. 
We believe that diversification and innovation will play a significant role in the transition to a low carbon future. To date, we have made large investments in natural gas infrastructure and continue to see significant opportunity in renewable energy, particularly offshore wind. Furthermore, we have tested our existing assets for various energy transition scenarios and concluded that they are highly resilient and can be relied upon for stable cash flow generation well into the future. 
STRATEGIC ENABLERS
Our success in executing on our strategic priorities is very much enabled by our commitment to ESG issues, the quality and capabilities of our people and the extent to which we embrace technology and encourage innovation as a competitive advantage.
ESG
Sustainability is integral to our ability to safely and reliably deliver the energy people need and want. How well we perform as a steward of our environment, a safe operator of essential energy infrastructure, a diverse and inclusive employer and a responsible corporate citizen is inextricably linked to our ability to achieve our strategic priorities and create long-term value for all stakeholders. 
Our commitment to strong ESG practices and performance has long been core to how we do business and we are proud to be recognized as a leader amongst our peers. In 2020, we set out ambitious goals including:
•Net zero GHG emissions by 2050 with an interim target to reduce GHG emissions intensity 35% by 2030;
•Increased representation of diverse groups within our workforce by 2025, including representation goals of 40% women and 28% racial and ethnic groups, along with new initiatives to enhance supplier diversity;
•Strengthening diversity on our Board with representation goals of 40% women and 20% racial and ethnic groups by 2025; and
•Annual safety and reliability targets that drive continuous improvement towards our goal of zero incidents, injuries and occupational injuries, and implementation of robust cyber defense programs.
These goals represent the next stage of our progression to ensure we are positioned to grow our company sustainably for many decades to come. Beginning in 2021, we will measure ESG performance when determining incentive compensation. Achieving our goals will put us in a better position to successfully transition to a low carbon, more diverse and inclusive future. 
People
Our employees are essential to our long-term success and enhancing the capability of our people to maximize their potential is a key area of focus. We value diversity and have embedded inclusive practices throughout our programs and approach to people management. Furthermore, we strive to maintain industry competitive compensation and retention programs that provide both short-term and long-term performance incentives.
Technology
Given the competitive climate of today’s energy sector, we recognize the vital role technology can play in helping us achieve our strategic objectives. Our two Technology and Innovation labs, located in Calgary and Houston, embody our commitment to technology enabled business solutions. Leveraging the benefits of technology to contribute to safety, reliability and the profitability of assets has become entrenched in our everyday operations.
We provide annual progress updates related to the above initiatives in our annual Sustainability Report which can be found at https://www.enbridge.com/sustainability-reports. Unless otherwise specifically stated, none of the information contained on, or connected to, the Enbridge website is incorporated by reference in, or otherwise part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Our activities are carried out through five business segments: Liquids Pipelines; Gas Transmission and Midstream; Gas Distribution and Storage; Renewable Power Generation; and Energy Services, as discussed below.
LIQUIDS PIPELINES
Liquids Pipelines consists of pipelines and terminals in Canada and the US that transport various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons.
MAINLINE SYSTEM
The Mainline System is comprised of the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The Canadian Mainline is a common carrier pipeline system which transports various grades of oil and other liquid hydrocarbons within western Canada and from western Canada to the Canada/US border near Gretna, Manitoba and Neche, North Dakota and from the US/Canada border near Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario to eastern Canada and the northeastern US. The Canadian Mainline includes six adjacent pipelines with a combined capacity of approximately 2.9 million barrels per day (bpd) that connect with the Lakehead System at the Canada/US border, as well as five pipelines that deliver crude oil and refined products into eastern Canada and the northeastern US. We have operated, and frequently expanded, the Canadian Mainline since 1949. The Lakehead System is the portion of the Mainline System in the US. It is an interstate common carrier pipeline system regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and is the primary transporter of crude oil and liquid petroleum from western Canada to the US.
Competitive Toll Settlement
The Competitive Toll Settlement (CTS) is the current framework governing tolls paid for products shipped on the Canadian Mainline, with the exception of Lines 8 and 9 which are tolled on a separate basis. The 10-year settlement was negotiated by representatives of Enbridge, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and other shippers on the Canadian Mainline. It was approved by the National Energy Board (now the Canada Energy Regulator (CER)). The CTS provides for a Canadian Local Toll (CLT) for deliveries within western Canada, as well as an International Joint Tariff (IJT) for crude oil shipments originating in western Canada, on the Canadian Mainline, and delivered into the US, via the Lakehead System, and into eastern Canada. The IJT tolls are denominated in US dollars. The IJT is designed to provide shippers on the Mainline System with a stable and competitive long-term toll, thereby preserving and enhancing throughput on the Mainline System. The CLT and the IJT are adjusted annually, on July 1 of each year, at a rate equal to 75% of the Canadian Gross Domestic Product at Market Price Index published by Statistics Canada.
Although the current CTS has a 10-year term and is in place until June 30, 2021, it does not require shippers to commit to certain volumes. Shippers nominate volumes on a monthly basis and we allocate capacity to maximize the efficiency of the Mainline System. 
Local tolls for service on the Lakehead System are not affected by the CTS and continue to be established pursuant to the Lakehead System’s existing toll agreements, as described below. Under the terms of the IJT agreement, the Canadian Mainline’s share of the IJT relating to pipeline transportation of a batch from any western Canada receipt point to the US border is equal to the IJT applicable to that batch’s US delivery point less the Lakehead System’s local toll to that delivery point. This amount is referred to as the Canadian Mainline IJT Residual Benchmark Toll and is denominated in US dollars.
Lakehead System Local Tolls
Transportation rates are governed by the FERC for deliveries from the Canada/US border near Neche, North Dakota, Clearbrook, Minnesota and other points to principal delivery points on the Lakehead System. The Lakehead System periodically adjusts these transportation rates as allowed under the FERC’s index methodology and tariff agreements, the main components of which are index rates and the Facilities Surcharge Mechanism. Index rates, the base portion of the transportation rates for the Lakehead System, are subject to an annual adjustment which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the FERC. The Facilities Surcharge Mechanism allows the Lakehead System to recover costs associated with certain shipper-requested projects through an incremental surcharge in addition to the existing index rates, and is subject to annual adjustment on April 1 of each year. To the extent that the Lakehead System transportation rates materially under-recover the Lakehead System cost of service, an application can be made with the FERC to seek approval to increase the rates in order to bring recoveries in-line with costs.
Mainline System Contracting 
On December 19, 2019, we submitted an application to the CER to implement contracting on our Mainline System. The application for contracted and uncommitted service included the associated terms, conditions and tolls of each service, which would be offered in an open season following approval by the CER. The tolls and services would replace the current CTS that is in place until June 30, 2021. If a replacement agreement is not in place by June 30, 2021, the CTS provides for tolls to continue on an interim basis.
For further information, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments - Mainline System Contracting. 
REGIONAL OIL SANDS SYSTEM
The Regional Oil Sands System includes five intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines; the Athabasca Pipeline, Waupisoo Pipeline, Woodland Pipeline, Wood Buffalo Extension/Athabasca Twin pipeline system and the Norlite Pipeline System (Norlite), as well as two large terminals: the Athabasca Terminal located north of Fort McMurray, Alberta and the Cheecham Terminal, located south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Regional Oil Sands System also includes numerous laterals and related facilities which currently provide access for oil sands production from twelve producing oil sands projects.
The combined capacity of the intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines is approximately 930 kbpd to Edmonton and 1,370 kbpd into Hardisty, with Norlite providing approximately 218 kbpd of diluent capacity into the Fort McMurray region. We have a 50% interest in the Woodland Pipeline and a 70% interest in Norlite. The Regional Oil Sands System is anchored by long-term agreements with multiple oil sands producers that provide cash flow stability and also include provisions for the recovery of some of the operating costs of this system.
GULF COAST AND MID-CONTINENT
Gulf Coast includes Seaway Crude Pipeline System (Seaway Pipeline), Flanagan South Pipeline (Flanagan South), Spearhead Pipeline and Gray Oak Pipeline, as well as the Mid-Continent System comprised of the Cushing Terminal.
We have a 50% interest in the 1,078-kilometer (670-mile) Seaway Pipeline, including the 805-kilometer (500-mile), 30-inch diameter long-haul system between Cushing, Oklahoma and Freeport, Texas, as well as the Texas City Terminal and Distribution System which serve refineries in the Houston and Texas City areas. Total aggregate capacity on the Seaway Pipeline system is approximately 950 kbpd. Seaway Pipeline also includes 8.8 million barrels of crude oil storage tank capacity on the Texas Gulf Coast.
Flanagan South is a 950-kilometer (590-mile), 36-inch diameter interstate crude oil pipeline that originates at our terminal at Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, and terminates in Cushing, Oklahoma. Flanagan South has a capacity of approximately 600 kbpd.
Spearhead Pipeline is a long-haul pipeline that delivers crude oil from Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, to Cushing, Oklahoma. The Spearhead pipeline has a capacity of approximately 193 kbpd.
The Gray Oak pipeline is a 1,368-kilometer (850-mile) crude oil system, which runs from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the US Gulf Coast. The Gray Oak pipeline has an expected average annual capacity of 900 kbpd and transports light crude oil. We have an effective 22.8% interest in the pipeline. Initial in-service for the pipeline commenced in November 2019 with full service achieved in the second quarter of 2020.
The Mid-Continent System is comprised of storage terminals at Cushing, Oklahoma (Cushing Terminal), consisting of over 80 individual storage tanks ranging in size from 78 to 570 thousand barrels. Total storage shell capacity of Cushing Terminal is approximately 20 million barrels. A portion of the storage facilities are used for operational purposes, while the remainder are contracted to various crude oil market participants for their term storage requirements. Contract fees include fixed monthly storage fees, throughput fees for receiving and delivering crude to and from connecting pipelines and terminals, as well as blending fees.
OTHER
Other includes Southern Lights Pipeline, Express-Platte System, Bakken System and Feeder Pipelines and Other.
Southern Lights Pipeline is a single stream 180 kbpd 16/18/20-inch diameter pipeline that ships diluent from the Manhattan Terminal near Chicago, Illinois to three western Canadian delivery facilities, located at the Edmonton and Hardisty terminals in Alberta and the Kerrobert terminal in Saskatchewan. Both the Canadian portion of Southern Lights Pipeline and the US portion of Southern Lights Pipeline receive tariff revenues under long-term contracts with committed shippers. Southern Lights Pipeline capacity is 90% contracted with the remaining 10% of the capacity assigned for shippers to ship uncommitted volumes.
The Express-Platte System consists of the Express pipeline and the Platte pipeline, and crude oil storage of approximately 5.6 million barrels. It is an approximate 2,736-kilometer (1,700-mile) long crude oil transportation system, which begins at Hardisty, Alberta, and terminates at Wood River, Illinois. The 310 kbpd Express pipeline carries crude oil to US refining markets in the Rocky Mountains area, including Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah. The 145 to 164 kbpd Platte pipeline, which interconnects with the Express pipeline at Casper, Wyoming, transports crude oil predominantly from the Bakken shale and western Canada to refineries in the midwest. Express pipeline capacity is typically committed under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers. A small portion of Express pipeline capacity and all of the Platte pipeline capacity is used by uncommitted shippers who pay only for the pipeline capacity they actually use in a given month.
The Bakken System consists of the North Dakota System and the Bakken Pipeline System. The North Dakota System services the Bakken in North Dakota and is comprised of a crude oil gathering and interstate pipeline transportation system. The gathering system provides delivery to Clearbrook, Minnesota for service on the Lakehead system or a variety of interconnecting pipeline and rail export facilities. The interstate portion of the system has both US and Canadian components that extend from Berthold, North Dakota into Cromer, Manitoba.
Tariffs on the US portion of the North Dakota System are governed by the FERC and include a local tariff. The Canadian portion is categorized as a Group 2 pipeline, and as such, its tolls are regulated by the CER on a complaint basis. Tolls on the interstate pipeline system are based on long-term take-or-pay agreements with anchor shippers.
We have an effective 27.6% interest in the Bakken Pipeline System, which connects the Bakken formation in North Dakota to markets in eastern PADD II and the US Gulf Coast. The Bakken Pipeline System consists of the DAPL from the Bakken area in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline from Patoka, Illinois to Nederland, Texas. Current capacity is 570 kbpd of crude oil with the potential to be expanded through additional pumping horsepower. The Bakken Pipeline System is anchored by long-term throughput commitments from a number of producers.
Feeder Pipelines and Other includes a number of liquids storage assets and pipeline systems in Canada and the US.
Key assets included in Feeder Pipelines and Other are the Hardisty Contract Terminal and Hardisty Storage Caverns located near Hardisty, Alberta, a key crude oil pipeline hub in western Canada and the Southern Access Extension (SAX) pipeline which originates in Flanagan, Illinois and delivers to Patoka, Illinois. We have an effective 65% interest in the 300 kbpd SAX pipeline of which the majority of its capacity is commercially secured under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers.
Feeder Pipelines and Other also includes Patoka Storage, the Toledo pipeline system and the Norman Wells (NW) System. Patoka Storage is comprised of four storage tanks with 480 thousand barrels of shell capacity located in Patoka, Illinois. The 101 kbpd Toledo pipeline system connects with the Lakehead System and delivers to Ohio and Michigan. The 45 kbpd NW System transports crude oil from Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories to Zama, Alberta and has a cost-of-service rate structure based on established terms with shippers.
COMPETITION
Other competing carriers available to ship western Canadian liquid hydrocarbons to markets in Canada, the US and internationally represent competition to our liquids pipelines network. Competition amongst existing pipelines is based primarily on the cost of transportation, access to supply, the quality and reliability of service, contract carrier alternatives and proximity to markets.
Competition also arises from proposed pipeline expansions that provide access to markets currently served by our liquids pipelines, as well as from proposed projects enhancing infrastructure in the Alberta regional oil sands market. The Mid-Continent and Bakken systems also face competition from existing pipelines, proposed future pipelines and existing and alternative gathering facilities. Competition for storage facilities in the US includes large integrated oil companies and other midstream energy partnerships. Additionally, volatile crude price differentials and insufficient pipeline capacity on either our or competitors' pipelines can make transportation of crude oil by rail competitive, particularly to markets not currently served by pipelines.
We believe that our liquids pipelines continue to provide attractive options to producers in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) and North Dakota due to our competitive tolls and flexibility through our multiple delivery and storage points. We also employ long-term agreements with shippers, which mitigates competition risk by ensuring consistent supply to our liquids pipelines network. Our current complement of growth projects to expand market access and to enhance capacity on our pipeline system are expected to provide shippers reliable and long-term competitive solutions for liquids transportation. We have a proven track record of successfully executing projects to meet the needs of our customers and our existing right-of-way for the Mainline System also provides a competitive advantage as it can be difficult and costly to obtain rights-of-way for new pipelines traversing new areas. In addition, we are currently pursuing the offering of contracted service on the Mainline System, which would further contribute to mitigating competition risk.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND
We have an established and successful history of being the largest transporter of crude oil to the US, the world’s largest market for crude oil. While US demand for Canadian crude oil production will support the use of our infrastructure for the foreseeable future, North American and global crude oil supply and demand fundamentals are shifting, and we have a role to play in this transition by developing long-term transportation options that enable the efficient flow of crude oil from supply regions to end-user markets.
The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the crude oil market in 2020. International prices weakened as lockdowns led to a reduction in energy consumption, lower refinery utilization and a glut in supply. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with producers around the world, cut crude oil production to stabilize international prices and inventories. WCSB production substantially recovered in the second half of the year as refinery demand has picked up and the Alberta production curtailment program has ended.

Our Mainline System throughput, as measured at the Canada/US border at Gretna, Manitoba saw deliveries of 2.44 million bpd in the second quarter of 2020, a 400 kbpd drop from the previous quarter. Volumes improved in the third quarter to 2.55 million bpd and in the fourth quarter to 2.65 million bpd driven by improved refinery utilization in the US and Canada. The Mainline System also returned to apportionment in the fourth quarter, as heavy crude oil shipment nominations exceeded capacity on portions of the system. Lower supply of heavy crude from Latin America and the Middle East is driving increased demand for Canadian heavy crude in the US Gulf Coast even as refinery utilization remained below pre-pandemic levels.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial performance of our Liquids Pipelines business continues to be modest given the cost effectiveness of our Mainline System tolls and commercial arrangements, which underpin many of our pipelines. These arrangements provide a significant measure of protection against volume fluctuations. Our Mainline System is well positioned to continue to provide safe and efficient transportation which will enable western Canadian and Bakken production to reach attractive markets in the US and eastern Canada at a competitive cost.
Over the long term, continued growth in global energy consumption is expected to be primarily driven by emerging economies in regions outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), mainly in India and China. In North America, demand growth for transportation fuels is expected to moderate due to vehicle fuel efficiencies and increasing sales of electric vehicles. Accordingly, there is a strategic opportunity to establish tide-water export facilities to service North American producers wanting access to global markets.
Global crude oil production is expected to continue to grow through 2035 to meet this increase in global demand. This supply will primarily come from OPEC countries and North America. Growth in supply from OPEC is partly due to the expected recovery of Iraqi and Libyan production. Saudi Arabia also has the capacity to increase production as necessary. The pace of growth in North America will be governed by a number of factors including crude oil prices, corresponding production decisions by OPEC, increasing environmental regulation, sufficient pipeline egress and prolonged approval processes for new pipelines with access to the US Gulf Coast and tide-water. Recent forecasts continue to show long-term supply growth from the WCSB, however the projected pace of growth is slower than previous forecasts as a result of the evolving factors noted above.
In the near term, Canadian pipeline export capacity is expected to remain fully utilized, resulting in continued apportionment on our Mainline System and incremental production utilizing non-pipeline transportation services (e.g. rail and trucks) until such time as sufficient pipeline capacity is made available. Over the longer term, however, it will be important to develop additional WCSB pipeline egress alternatives as we believe pipelines will continue to be the most reliable, safe and cost-effective means of transportation.
We help alleviate price discounts for producers and rising supply costs to refiners through optimization of throughput on our existing liquids pipelines systems and through investment in new pipelines and related infrastructure to provide expanded transportation capacity and sustainable connectivity to alternative markets. Progress on the development and construction of our commercially secured growth projects is discussed in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.

SESH extends from the Perryville Hub in northeastern Louisiana where the shale gas production of eastern Texas, northern Louisiana and Arkansas, along with conventional production, is reached from six major interconnections. SESH extends to Alabama, interconnecting with 14 major north-south pipelines and three high-deliverability storage facilities and has a peak day capacity of 1.1 bcf/d of natural gas. We have a 50% interest in SESH.
Vector is an approximately 560-kilometer (348-mile) pipeline travelling between Joliet, Illinois in the Chicago area and Ontario. Vector can deliver 1.745 bcf/d of natural gas, of which 455 million cubic feet per day (mmcf/d) is leased to NEXUS. We have a 60% interest in Vector.
Transmission and storage services are generally provided under firm agreements where customers reserve capacity in pipelines and storage facilities. The vast majority of these agreements provide for fixed reservation charges that are paid monthly regardless of the actual volumes transported on the pipelines, plus a small variable component that is based on volumes transported, injected or withdrawn, which is intended to recover variable costs.
Interruptible transmission and storage services are also available where customers can use capacity if it exists at the time of the request and are generally at a higher toll than long-term contracted rates. Interruptible revenues depend on the amount of volumes transported or stored and the associated rates for this service. Storage operations also provide a variety of other value-added services including natural gas parking, loaning and balancing services to meet customers’ needs.
CANADIAN GAS TRANSMISSION
Canadian Gas Transmission is comprised of Westcoast Energy Inc.’s (Westcoast) British Columbia (BC) Pipeline, Alliance Pipeline and other minor midstream gas gathering pipelines.

OTHER
Other consists primarily of our offshore assets. Enbridge Offshore Pipelines is comprised of 11 natural gas gathering and FERC regulated transmission pipelines and four oil pipelines. These pipelines are located in four major corridors in the Gulf of Mexico, extending to deepwater developments, and include almost 2,100-kilometers (1,300-miles) of underwater pipe and onshore facilities with total capacity of approximately 6.5 bcf/d.
COMPETITION
Our natural gas transmission and storage businesses compete with similar facilities that serve our supply and market areas in the transmission and storage of natural gas. The flow pattern of natural gas is changing across North America due to emerging supply sources and evolving demand centers, which creates competition for growth opportunities. The principal elements of competition are location, rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.
The natural gas transported in our business competes with other forms of energy available to our customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane, fuel oils, nuclear and renewable energy. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, levels of business activity, long-term economic conditions, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels, weather and other factors.
Competition exists in all markets that our businesses serve. Competitors include interstate/interprovincial and intrastate/intraprovincial pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that transport, gather, treat, process and market natural gas or NGLs. Because pipelines are generally the most efficient mode of transportation for natural gas over land, the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipeline companies.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND
Our gas transmission assets make up one of the largest natural gas transportation networks in North America, driving connectivity between prolific supply basins and major demand centers within the continent. Our systems have been integral to the transition in natural gas fundamentals over the last decade and will continue to play a part as the energy landscape evolves. Shifts in production and consumption, both domestic and foreign, will require that we continue to serve as a critical link between markets.
In 2010, natural gas production in each of the Appalachian and Permian basins were less than 5.0 bcf/d each. Today, these regions produce more than 43.0 bcf/d of natural gas on a combined basis. Improved technology and increased shale gas drilling have increased the supply of low-cost natural gas. As well, there has been and continues to be a corresponding increase in demand for our natural gas infrastructure in North America. Through a series of expansions and reversals on our core systems, combined with the execution of greenfield projects and strategic acquisitions, we have been able to meet the needs of producers and consumers alike. Our US Gas Transmission systems were initially designed to transport natural gas from the Gulf Coast to the supply starved northeast markets. Our asset base now has the capability to transport diverse bi-directional supply to the northeast, southeast, midwest, Gulf Coast and LNG markets on a fully subscribed and highly utilized basis.
The northeast market continues its role as a predominantly supply constrained region with steady demand into 2040. The bi-directional capabilities offered by our US Gas Transmission system allows us to deliver in an efficient manner to our regional customers. The region has seen an increase in natural gas supply due to the development of the Marcellus and Utica shales in the Appalachia region.
The southeast market is linked to multiple, highly liquid supply pools that include the Marcellus and Utica shale developments, offering consistent supply and stable pricing to a growing population of end-use customers across our multiple systems under long term, utility-like arrangements.
With connectivity to Appalachian and western Canadian supply through our systems, the midwest market has access to two of the lowest cost gas producing regions on the continent. As demand in the region is expected to continue to grow by approximately 2.3 bcf/d over the next two decades, maintaining this link will remain important. Flexibility in supply for this market is especially critical to maintaining liquidity and price stability as natural gas continues to replace coal-fired generation.
Gulf Coast demand growth is being driven by an ongoing wave of gas-intensive petrochemical facilities, along with power generation, an increase in the volume of LNG exports and additional pipeline exports to Mexico. Demand to these markets in the region is anticipated to grow by more than 23.0 bcf/d through 2040. The Gulf Coast market has been the beneficiary of low cost capacity on our assets as the relationship between supply and market centers has shifted. Such cost-effective capacity is difficult to access or replicate, offering existing shippers and transporters stability of capacity and utilization. Tide-water market access and proximity to Mexico continue to make this region a platform of global trade as pipeline and LNG exports continue their growth trajectory. The US exported over 9 bcf/d of natural gas to LNG markets, primarily from the Gulf Coast region, at the end of 2020.
Despite there being strong growth in both supply and demand in the US, a lack of adequate transportation capacity has placed downward pressure on local natural gas pricing. The Appalachian Basin has seen price differentials of $1.00 to $2.00 per million British Thermal Units relative to Henry Hub in the Gulf Coast over the last few years. Unlike the dry gas production of the Marcellus, natural gas production growth in the Permian Basin is a result of robust crude oil production taking place in the region. Gas supplies from the region remained above prior year levels on average throughout 2020.
Western Canada, not unlike other supply hubs, is a source of low-cost supply seeking access to premium markets in North America and globally. One of the few vital links to demand centers in the pacific northwest are our own systems in the region, which are highly utilized.
Global energy demand is expected to increase approximately 23% by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency, driven primarily by economic growth in non-OECD countries. Natural gas will play an important role in meeting this energy demand as gas consumption is anticipated to grow by approximately 30% during this period as one of the world’s fastest growing energy sources. North American exports will play a significant part in meeting global demand, underscoring the ability of our assets to remain highly utilized by shippers, and highlighting the need for incremental transportation solutions across North America. In response to these global fundamentals, we believe we are well positioned to provide value-added solutions to shippers. We are responding to the need for regional infrastructure with additional investments in Canadian and US gas transportation facilities. Progress on the development and construction of our commercially secured growth projects is discussed in Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.
GAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE
Gas Distribution and Storage consists of our natural gas utility operations, the core of which is Enbridge Gas Inc. (Enbridge Gas), which serves residential, commercial and industrial customers throughout Ontario. This business segment also includes natural gas distribution activities in Québec and an investment in Noverco Inc. (Noverco).
ENBRIDGE GAS 
Enbridge Gas is a rate-regulated natural gas distribution utility with storage and transmission services that have been in operation for 172 years. Enbridge Gas serves approximately 75% of Ontario residents via approximately 3.8 million residential, commercial and industrial meter connections.
There are three principal interrelated aspects of the natural gas distribution business in which Enbridge Gas is directly involved: Distribution, Transportation and Storage.
Distribution
Enbridge Gas’ principal source of revenue arises from distribution of natural gas to customers. The services provided to residential, small commercial and industrial heating customers are primarily on a general service basis, without a specific fixed term or fixed price contract. The services provided to larger commercial and industrial customers are usually on an annual contract basis under firm or interruptible service contracts. Under a firm contract, Enbridge Gas is obligated to deliver natural gas to the customer up to a maximum daily volume. The service provided under an interruptible contract is similar to that of a firm contract, except that it allows for service interruption at Enbridge Gas’ option primarily to meet seasonal or peak demands. The Ontario Energy Board (OEB) approves rates for both contract and general services. The distribution system consists of approximately 146,000-kilometers (90,720-miles) of pipelines that carry natural gas from the point of local supply to customers.
Customers have a choice with respect to natural gas supply. Customers may purchase and deliver their own natural gas to points upstream of the distribution system or directly into Enbridge Gas’ distribution system, or, alternatively, they may choose a system supply option, whereby customers purchase natural gas from Enbridge Gas’ supply portfolio. To acquire the necessary volume of natural gas to serve its customers, Enbridge Gas maintains a diversified natural gas supply portfolio, acquiring supplies on a delivered basis in Ontario, as well as acquiring supply from multiple supply basins across North America.
Transportation
Enbridge Gas contracts for firm transportation service, primarily with TransCanada Pipelines Limited (TransCanada), Vector and NEXUS, to meet its annual natural gas supply requirements. The transportation service contracts are not directly linked with any particular source of natural gas supply. Separating transportation contracts from natural gas supply allows Enbridge Gas flexibility in obtaining its own natural gas supply and accommodating the requests of its direct purchase customers for assignment of TransCanada capacity. Enbridge Gas forecasts the natural gas supply needs of its customers, including the associated transportation and storage requirements.
In addition to contracting for transportation service, Enbridge Gas offers firm and interruptible transportation services on its own Dawn-Parkway pipeline system. Enbridge Gas’ transmission system consists of approximately 5,500-kilometers (3,418-miles) of high-pressure pipeline and five mainline compressor stations and has an effective peak daily demand capacity of 7.6 bcf/d. Enbridge Gas’ transmission system also links an extensive network of underground storage pools at the Tecumseh Gas Storage facility and Dawn Hub (collectively, Dawn) to major Canadian and US markets, and forms an important link in moving natural gas from western Canada and US supply basins to central Canadian and northeastern US markets.
As the supply of natural gas in areas close to Ontario continues to grow, there is an increased demand to access these diverse supplies at Dawn and transport them along the Dawn-Parkway pipeline system to markets in Ontario, eastern Canada and the northeastern US. Enbridge Gas delivered 1,793 bcf of gas through its distribution and transmission system in 2020. A substantial amount of Enbridge Gas’ transportation revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately 13.5 years and the longest remaining contract term being 22 years.
Storage
Enbridge Gas’ business is highly seasonal as daily market demand for natural gas fluctuates with changes in weather, with peak consumption occurring in the winter months. Utilization of storage facilities permits Enbridge Gas to take delivery of natural gas on favorable terms during off-peak summer periods for subsequent use during the winter heating season. This practice permits Enbridge Gas to minimize the annual cost of transportation of natural gas from its supply basins, assists in reducing its overall cost of natural gas supply and adds a measure of security in the event of any short-term interruption of transportation of natural gas to Enbridge Gas’ franchise areas.
Enbridge Gas’ storage facility at Dawn is located in southwestern Ontario, and has a total working capacity of approximately 276 bcf in 34 underground facilities located in depleted gas fields. Dawn is the largest integrated underground storage facility in Canada and one of the largest in North America. Approximately 180 bcf of the total working capacity is available to Enbridge Gas for utility operations. Enbridge Gas also has storage contracts with third parties for 21 bcf of storage capacity.
Dawn offers customers an important link in the movement of natural gas from western Canadian and US supply basins to markets in central Canada and the northeast US. Dawn's configuration provides flexibility for injections, withdrawals and cycling. Customers can purchase both firm and interruptible storage services at Dawn. Dawn offers customers a wide range of market choices and options with easy access to upstream and downstream markets. During 2020, Dawn provided services such as storage, balancing, gas loans, transport, exchange and peaking services to over 200 counterparties.
A substantial amount of Enbridge Gas’ storage revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately four years and the longest remaining contract term being 16 years.
NOVERCO
Noverco is a holding company that wholly-owns Énergir, LP (Énergir), formerly known as Gaz Metro Limited Partnership, a natural gas distribution company operating in Quebec, with interests in subsidiary companies operating gas transmission, gas distribution and power distribution businesses in Québec and Vermont. Énergir serves approximately 525,000 residential and industrial customers and is regulated by the Québec Régie de l’énergie and the Vermont Public Utility Commission. Noverco also holds an investment in our common shares. We own an equity interest in Noverco through ownership of 38.9% of its common shares and an investment in its preferred shares.
GAZIFÈRE
We wholly own Gazifère, a natural gas distribution company that serves approximately 43,000 customers in western Québec, a market not served by Énergir. Gazifère is regulated by the Québec Régie de l’énergie.
COMPETITION
Enbridge Gas’ distribution system is regulated by the OEB and is subject to regulation in a number of areas, including rates. Enbridge Gas is not generally subject to third-party competition within its distribution franchise areas.
Enbridge Gas competes with other forms of energy available to its customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane and fuel oils. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include weather, price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels and other factors.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND
We expect that demand for natural gas in North America will continue to see low annual growth over the long term with continued growth in peak day demands. We expect demand for natural gas connections in Ontario to continue to grow due to continued population growth. Some modest growth driven by low natural gas prices is expected to continue given the significant price advantage relative to alternate energy options, even with increasing carbon charges, with specific interest coming from communities that are not currently serviced by natural gas. Enbridge Gas continues to focus on promoting conservation and energy efficiency by undertaking activities focused on reducing natural gas consumption through various demand side management programs offered across all markets.
The storage and transportation marketplace continues to respond to changing natural gas supply dynamics including a robust supply environment. In recent years, the robust North American gas supply balance, due mainly to the development of unconventional gas volumes including the Alberta, British Columbia, Marcellus and Utica supply basins, has resulted in lower commodity prices and narrower seasonal price spreads. Unregulated storage values are primarily determined based on the difference in value between winter and summer natural gas prices. Storage values have been relatively stable to slightly rising as the North American natural gas supply and demand slowly returned to a more balanced position.
RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION
Renewable Power Generation consists primarily of investments in wind and solar assets, as well as geothermal, waste heat recovery, and transmission assets. In North America, assets are primarily located in the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Québec and in the states of Colorado, Texas, Indiana and West Virginia. In Europe, we hold equity interests in operating offshore wind facilities in the coastal waters of the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as in several projects under construction and active development in France. Further, we are pursuing new European development opportunities through Maple Power Ltd., a joint venture in which we hold a 50% interest.
Combined Renewable Power Generation investments represent approximately 1,977 MW of net generation capacity. Of this amount, approximately:
•1,392 MW is generated by North American wind facilities;
•255 MW is generated by European offshore wind facilities;
•211 MW will be generated by the Saint-Nazaire and Fécamp Offshore Wind projects, both of which are currently under construction; and
•80 MW is generated by North American solar facilities in operation, with an additional 13 MW in projects under construction.
The vast majority of the power produced from these facilities is sold under long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).
Renewable Power Generation also includes the East-West Tie, a 450-MW transmission line in northwestern Ontario, which is currently under construction and is expected to reach commercial operation in the first half of 2022. In May 2020, we sold the Montana-Alberta Tie-Line (MATL), a 300-MW transmission line running from Great Falls, Montana to Lethbridge, Alberta. For further information refer to Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8. Dispositions.
JOINT VENTURES / EQUITY INVESTMENTS
The investments in the Canadian renewable assets and two of the US renewable assets are held within a joint venture in which we maintain a 51% interest and continue to manage, operate, and provide administrative support.
We also own interests in European offshore wind facilities through the following joint ventures:
•a 24.9% interest in Rampion Offshore Wind, located in the United Kingdom, which went into service April 2018;
•a 25% interest in Hohe See Offshore and its subsequent expansion, located in Germany, which went into service October 2019 and January 2020, respectively; 
•a 25.5% interest in the Saint-Nazaire Offshore Wind project, located in France, which is currently under construction; and
•a 17.9% interest in the Fécamp Offshore Wind project, under construction in France.
The ownership interest percentages in the Saint-Nazaire and Fécamp Offshore Wind projects reflect the sale of 49% of an entity that holds our 50% interest in Éolien Maritime France SAS (EMF) to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) which is expected to close in the first half of 2021.
COMPETITION
Our Renewable Power Generation assets operate in the North American and European power markets, which are subject to competition and supply and demand fundamentals for power in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The majority of revenue is generated pursuant to long-term PPAs or has been substantially hedged. As such, the financial performance is not significantly impacted by fluctuating power prices arising from supply/demand imbalances or the actions of competing facilities during the term of the applicable contracts. However, the renewable energy sector includes large utilities, small independent power producers and private equity investors, which are expected to aggressively compete for new project development opportunities and for the right to supply customers when contracts expire.
To grow in an environment of heightened competition, we strategically seek opportunities to collaborate with well-established renewable power developers and financial partners and to target regions with commercial constructs consistent with our low risk business model. In addition, we bring to bear the expertise of completing and delivering large scale infrastructure projects.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND
The renewable power generation network in North America and Europe is expected to grow significantly over the next 20 years due to the replacement of older fossil fuel-based sources of electricity generation in support of announced governmental carbon emissions reduction targets. Any additional governmental actions toward reducing emissions and/or increasing electrification will further accelerate renewable electricity demand growth and electrification across all sectors.

On the demand side, North American economic growth over the longer term and the continued electrification and decarbonization of the residential, transportation and industrial sectors are expected to drive growing electricity demand. However, continued efficiency gains are expected to make the economy less energy-intensive and temper overall demand growth. 
On the supply side in North America, legislation is accelerating the retirement of aging coal-fired generation, while generation from nuclear power is also forecast to decline. As a result, North America requires significant new generation capacity and the extension of project lives and/or PPAs of preferred technologies. Gas-fired and renewable energy facilities, including solar and wind (which make up the bulk of our renewable power assets), are generally the preferred sources to replace coal-fired generation due to their low carbon intensities.
The falling capital and operating costs of wind and solar, combined with their continuously improving capacity factors, are expected to continue the ongoing trend of making renewable energy more competitive and support investment over the long-term, regardless of available government incentives. Generation from renewable sources is expected to double over the next two decades in North America. Aside from the construction of new wind and solar facilities, other growth opportunities include repowering projects to increase output from, and extending the project-life of, our existing facilities.
In Europe, the renewable energy outlook is robust. Demand for electricity is expected to gradually increase over the next two decades, driven by electrification of transportation and buildings. Energy efficiency gains will temper, but not eliminate, demand growth. Renewable power will play a significant role in Britain and the European Union’s ability to meet their aggressive low-carbon and renewable energy targets, particularly wind and offshore wind.
On the supply side, the International Energy Agency expects coal to fall by more than 90%, while nuclear falls by one-third, by 2040. Over the same period, it anticipates power generation from renewable sources will more than double, including installed (onshore and offshore) wind more than doubling and photovoltaics solar power nearly tripling. We, through our European joint ventures, continue to invest in offshore wind projects in the United Kingdom, France and Germany to meet the growing demand.
ENERGY SERVICES
The Energy Services businesses in Canada and the US provide physical commodity marketing and logistical services to North American refiners, producers, and other customers.
Energy Services is primarily focused on servicing customers across the value chain and capturing value from quality, time, and location price differentials when opportunities arise. To execute these strategies, Energy Services transports and stores on both Enbridge-owned and third party assets using a combination of contracted long-term and short-term pipeline, storage tank, railcar, and truck capacity agreements.
COMPETITION
Energy Services’ earnings are primarily generated from arbitrage opportunities which, by their nature, can be replicated by competitors. An increase in market participants entering into similar arbitrage strategies could have an impact on our earnings. Efforts to mitigate competition risk include diversification of the marketing business by transacting at the majority of major hubs in North America and establishing long-term relationships with clients and pipelines.
ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER
Eliminations and Other includes operating and administrative costs that are not allocated to business segments and the impact of foreign exchange hedge settlements. Eliminations and Other also includes new business development activities and corporate investments.
OPERATIONAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC REGULATION
LIQUIDS PIPELINES
Operational Regulation
We are subject to numerous operational rules and regulations mandated by governments or applicable regulatory authorities, breaches of which could result in fines, penalties, operating restrictions and an overall increase in operating and compliance costs.
In the US, our interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), an agency within the of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines. These laws and regulations, among other things, include requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines and to operate them at permissible pressures.
PHMSA has revised existing regulations and promulgated new regulations establishing safety standards that are designed to improve and expand integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failure or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
In Canada, our pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety regulations administered by the CER or provincial regulators. Applicable legislation and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our pipelines. Among other obligations, this regulatory framework imposes requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines.
As in the US, several legislative changes addressing pipeline safety in Canada have recently been enacted. The changes evidence an increased focus on the implementation of management systems to address key areas such as emergency management, integrity management, safety, security and environmental protection. Other legislative changes have created authority for the CER to impose administrative monetary penalties for non-compliance with the regulatory regime it administers, as well as to impose financial requirements for future abandonment and major pipeline releases.
A key component of Liquids Pipelines safety and reliability is the approach to integrity management that uses reliability targets and safety case assessments. A long history of extensive inline inspection has provided detailed knowledge of the assets in the liquids pipeline system. Every segment of every pipeline is assessed and maintained, in a proactive manner, such that the probability of a leak is sufficiently low and that stringent reliability targets are met. Furthermore, the integrity management program has an independent step to check the results of our integrity assessments to validate the effectiveness of the program and to ensure that that the operational risk remains as low as reasonably practicable throughout the integrity inspection and assessment cycle. As inspection technology, pipeline materials and construction practices improve with time, and new data on threats and pipeline condition are gathered, our methods of maintaining fitness for service evolves; with a strong focus on continual improvement in every aspect of integrity management.
Environmental Regulation
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and provincial environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits and other approvals.
In particular, in the US, compliance with major Clean Air Act regulatory programs is likely to cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate off-site impacts of our operations, install pollution control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance. Some states in which we operate are implementing new emissions limits to comply with 2008 ozone standards regulated under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. In 2015, the ozone standards were lowered even further from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb, which may require states to implement additional emissions regulations. The precise nature of these compliance obligations at each of our facilities has not been finally determined and may depend in part on future regulatory changes. In addition, compliance with new and emerging environmental regulatory programs may significantly increase our operating costs compared to historical levels.
In the US, climate change action is evolving at federal, state and regional levels. The Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency in 2007 established that GHG emissions were pollutants subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. Pursuant to federal regulations, we are currently subject to an obligation to report our GHG emissions at our largest emitting facilities, but are not generally subject to limits on emissions of GHGs. The new US presidential administration has also announced that policies designed to combat climate change and reduce GHG emissions will be a key legislative and regulatory priority, and thus stricter emissions limits and air quality enforcement actions are possible In addition, a number of states have joined regional GHG initiatives, and a number are developing their own programs that would mandate reductions in GHG emissions. Public interest groups and regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing on the emission of methane associated with natural gas development and transmission as a source of GHG emissions. However, as the key details of future GHG restrictions and compliance mechanisms remain undefined, the likely future effects on our business are highly uncertain.
For its part, Canada has reaffirmed its strong preference for a harmonized approach with that of the US. In 2019, the Government of Canada implemented a federal system of carbon pricing. The pricing applies to provinces and territories that do not have a carbon pricing system in place that meets the federal benchmark. On November 19, 2020, the federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change introduced Bill C-12, the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which requires national targets for the reduction of GHG emissions in Canada be set, with the objective of attaining net-zero emissions by 2050. In December 2020, the Government of Canada announced plans to increase the federal carbon price by $15 per year, rising to $170 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030.
Due to the speculative outlook regarding any US federal and state policies, we cannot estimate the potential effect of proposed GHG policies on our future consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, such legislation or regulation could materially increase our operating costs, require material capital expenditures or create additional permitting, which could delay proposed construction projects.
Economic Regulation
Our liquids pipelines also face economic regulation risk. Broadly defined, economic regulation risk is the risk that governments or regulatory agencies change or reject proposed or existing commercial arrangements including permits and regulatory approvals for both new and existing projects, upon which future and current operations are dependent. Our Mainline System and other liquids pipelines are subject to the actions of various regulators, including the CER and FERC, with respect to the tariffs and tolls of those operations. The changing or rejecting of commercial arrangements, including decisions by regulators on the applicable permits and tariff structure or changes in interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulators, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. 
GAS TRANSMISSION AND MIDSTREAM
Operational Regulation
The span of regulation risks that apply to the Liquids Pipelines business as described above under Liquids Pipelines also applies to the Gas Transmission and Midstream business. Most of our US gas transmission operations are regulated by the FERC. The FERC regulates natural gas transmission in US interstate commerce including the establishment of rates for services. The FERC also regulates the construction of US interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, including the extension, enlargement and abandonment of facilities. In addition, certain operations are subject to oversight by state regulatory commissions. To the extent that the natural gas intrastate pipelines that transport or store natural gas in interstate commerce provide services under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, they are subject to FERC regulations. The FERC may propose and implement new rules and regulations affecting interstate natural gas transmission and storage companies, which remain subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect certain transmission of gas by intrastate pipelines.
Texas Eastern reached an agreement with its shippers and filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the FERC on October 28, 2019. On February 25, 2020, Texas Eastern received approval from the FERC of its uncontested rate case settlement with customers. In the first quarter of 2020, Texas Eastern recognized revenues from the settled rates retroactive to June 1, 2019, and put the settled rates into effect on April 1, 2020. On July 2, 2020, Algonquin received approval from the FERC of its uncontested rate case settlement with customers. In the third quarter of 2020, Algonquin recognized revenues from the settled rates retroactive to June 1, 2020, and put the settled rates into effect on September 1, 2020. East Tennessee filed a rate case in the second quarter of 2020 and customer settlement discussions commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020. The US portion of Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline filed a rate case in the second quarter of 2020 and an agreement was reached in principle with shippers in December 2020. A Stipulation and Agreement will be filed in February 2021 and we will await FERC approval. The US portion of Alliance Pipeline filed a rate case in the second quarter of 2020 and an agreement was reached in principle with shippers in January 2021. A Stipulation and Agreement will be filed in March 2021 and we will await FERC approval. In July 2020, the 2020-2021 rate settlement agreement with Westcoast's BC Pipeline shippers was approved by the CER. Following approval of the settlement, Westcoast applied and received approval from the CER on August 12, 2020 for the interim tolls to be made final, including the interim tolls from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020 as well as the revised interim tolls in effect as at April 1, 2020.
Our operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency and various other federal, state and local environmental agencies. Our US interstate natural gas pipelines and certain of DCP Midstream’s gathering and transmission pipelines are also subject to the regulations of the DOT concerning pipeline safety.
The intrastate natural gas and NGL pipelines owned by us and DCP Midstream are subject to state regulation. DCP Midstream's interstate NGL transportation pipelines are subject to FERC regulation. The natural gas gathering and processing activities of DCP Midstream are not subject to FERC regulation. 
Our Canadian operations are governed by various federal and provincial agencies with respect to pipeline safety, including the CER, the Transportation Safety Board and the Ontario Technical Standards and Safety Authority.
Our Canadian natural gas transmission operations are subject to regulation by the CER or the provincial agencies in Canada, such as the OEB. These agencies have jurisdiction similar to the FERC for regulating rates, the terms and conditions of service, the construction of additional facilities and acquisitions. In addition, these assets are subject to GHG emissions regulations, including GHG emissions management and carbon pricing policies. Across Canada there are a variety of new and evolving initiatives in development at the federal and provincial levels aimed at reducing GHG emissions. The Government of Canada has finalized a federal plan to have carbon pricing in place in all Canadian jurisdictions.
GAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE
Operational Regulation
Our gas distribution and storage utility operations are regulated by the OEB and the Québec Régie de l’énergie, among others. To the extent that the regulators’ future actions are different from current expectations, the timing and amount of recovery or refund of amounts recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, or amounts that would have been recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in absence of the effects of regulation, could be different from the amounts that are eventually recovered or refunded.
Enbridge Gas' distribution rates, commencing in 2019, are set under a five-year incentive regulation (IR) framework using a price cap mechanism. The price cap mechanism establishes new rates each year through an annual base rate escalation at inflation less a 0.3% productivity factor, annual updates for certain costs to be passed through to customers, and where applicable, the recovery of material discrete incremental capital investments beyond those that can be funded through base rates. The IR framework includes the continuation and establishment of certain deferral and variance accounts, as well as an earnings sharing mechanism that requires Enbridge Gas to share equally with customers any earnings in excess of 150 basis points over the annual OEB approved return on equity (ROE).
We seek to mitigate operational regulation risk. We retain dedicated professional staff and maintain strong relationships with customers, intervenors and regulators. This strong regulatory relationship continued in 2020 following OEB Decisions and Orders approving Phase 2 of Enbridge Gas’ application for 2020 rates and Phase 1 of Enbridge Gas’ application for 2021 rates. The Phase 2 Decision and Order approved the recovery of requested 2020 discrete incremental capital investments through the incremental capital module, while the Phase 1 Decision and Order approved 2021 base rate escalation under the price cap mechanism.
Enbridge Gas has continued to develop opportunities to support a low carbon future in Ontario. In 2020, the OEB approved Enbridge Gas' application to implement a voluntary RNG pilot program, whereby customers can voluntarily contribute towards the incremental cost of low carbon RNG which would displace regular natural gas. The OEB also approved Enbridge Gas' pilot project to construct facilities that will allow regular natural gas to be blended with hydrogen gas, in an isolated portion of the existing distribution system, with the intent to gain insight into the use of hydrogen as a method for decarbonizing natural gas for the purpose of reducing GHG emissions.
Environmental Regulation
Our workers, operations and facilities are subject to municipal, provincial and federal legislation which regulate the protection of the environment and the health and safety of workers. Environmental legislation primarily includes regulation of discharges to air, land and water; environmental assessment of natural gas infrastructure projects in Ontario; protection of species at risk and species at risk habitat; management and disposal of hazardous waste; the assessment and management of contaminated sites; and the reporting and reduction of GHG emissions.

Gas distribution system operation, as with any industrial operation, has the potential risk of abnormal or emergency conditions, or other unplanned events that could result in leaks or emissions in excess of permitted levels. These events could result in injuries to workers or the public, adverse impacts to the environment in which we operate, property damage or regulatory violations including orders and fines. We could also incur future liability for soil and groundwater contamination associated with past and present site activities.
In addition to gas distribution, we also operate storage facilities and a small amount of oil and brine production in southwestern Ontario. Environmental risk associated with these facilities is the potential for unplanned releases. In the event of a release, remediation of the affected area would be required. There would also be potential for fines, orders or charges under environmental legislation, and potential third-party liability claims by any affected landowners.

The gas distribution system and our other operations must maintain environmental approvals and permits from regulators to operate. As a result, these assets and facilities are subject to periodic inspections and/or audits. Annual reports, such as the Annual Written Summary Report are submitted to the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) and other regulators to demonstrate we are in good standing with our Environmental Compliance Approvals. Failure to maintain regulatory compliance could result in operational interruptions, fines, and/or orders for additional pollution control technology or environmental mitigation. As environmental requirements and regulations become more stringent, the cost to maintain compliance and the time required to obtain approvals has increased.
As with previous years, in 2020, we reported operational GHG emissions, including emissions from stationary combustion, flaring, venting and fugitive sources to Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), the Ontario MECP, and a number of voluntary reporting programs. In accordance with the provincial GHG regulations, stationary combustion and flaring emissions related to storage and transmission operations were verified in detail by a third-party accredited verifier with no material discrepancies found.

Enbridge Gas utilizes emissions data management processes and systems to help with the data capture and mandatory and voluntary reporting needs. Quantification methodologies and emission factors will continually be updated in the system as required. Enbridge Gas continues to work with industry associations to refine quantification methodologies and emissions factors, as well as best management practices to minimize emissions.
In October 2018, the federal government confirmed that Ontario is subject to the federal government’s carbon pricing program, otherwise known as the Federal Carbon Pricing Backstop Program. This program consists of two components: a carbon charge levied on fossil fuels, including natural gas, and an output-based pricing system (OBPS).

The federal carbon charge took effect on April 1, 2019 at a rate of 3.91 cents/cubic meter (m3) of natural gas and is applicable to the majority of customers. Enbridge Gas is registered as a natural gas distributor with the Canada Revenue Agency and remits the federal carbon charge on a monthly basis. The charge increases annually on April 1 of each year by 1.96 cents/m3, rising up to 9.79 cents/m3 in 2022. In December 2020, the federal government announced plans to increase the federal carbon price by $15 per year, rising to $170 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030. Enbridge Gas estimates that this will equate to a federal carbon charge on natural gas of approximately 33.31 cents/m3 in 2030.

The OBPS component came into effect on January 1, 2019. Under OBPS, a registered facility has a compliance obligation for the portion of their emissions that exceeds their annual facility emissions limit, which is calculated based on the sector specific output-based standard and annual production. Enbridge Gas is registered with ECCC as an emitter in the OBPS program and has an annual compliance obligation associated with the combustion and flaring emissions associated with its natural gas pipeline transmission system. As a registered facility under OBPS, Enbridge Gas submitted an annual report along with the required verification report from an accredited third-party verifier who found no material misstatements. Enbridge Gas is required to remit payment for facility emissions that exceed its annual facility emissions limit. Due to COVID-19, ECCC has delayed the payment deadline from December 15, 2020 to April 15, 2021, and therefore Enbridge Gas has deferred payment until the first half of 2021.

In September 2020, Ontario and the federal government announced that the federal government has accepted that Ontario’s Emission Performance Standards (EPS) will replace the federal OBPS for industrial facilities. The date of the transition has not yet been communicated. Enbridge Gas will continue to have a compliance obligation under either the OBPS or EPS program for its facility-related emissions, as well as the federal carbon charge for its customer-related emissions.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
WORKFORCE SIZE AND COMPOSITION
As at December 31, 2020, we had approximately 11,200 regular employees, including 1,600 unionized employees across our North American operations. This total rises to more than 13,000 if including temporary employees and contractors. We have a strong preference for direct employment relationships but where we have collectively bargained for employees, we have mature working relationships with our labor unions and the parties have traditionally committed themselves to the achievement of renewal agreements without a work stoppage.
SAFETY
We believe all injuries, incidents and occupational illnesses are preventable. Our overall focus on employee and contractor safety continues to result in strong performance compared against industry benchmarks and we are actively engaged in continuous improvement exercises as we pursue our goal of zero incidents. Refer also to Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments- COVID-19 Pandemic, Reduced Crude Oil Demand and Commodity Prices.
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
To ensure our workforce is reflective of the communities where we operate, we have pursued efforts to increase the representation of women, ethnic and racial groups, people with disabilities and veterans. Our original ambitions were set and shared with employees in 2018 with progress toward achievement shared regularly through our Diversity Dashboard. While we have made strong progress, we are accelerating the pace of our program and we have plans in place to meet our objectives by 2025. Consistent with our culture, we remain committed to open, two-way dialogue related to our goals, enhancing transparency and accountability for all stakeholders. 
In early 2021, we added Inclusion to our core values of Safety, Integrity and Respect to demonstrate this commitment. 
We are building an organization where people feel safe and welcome and have the opportunity to thrive and grow based on merit. As part of our evolving ESG strategy, we wanted to create a tighter link between our success and the workforce related ESG measures – including safety and diversity – that enable it. As a result, beginning in 2021, key metrics in these areas are embedded in our scorecards and directly impact compensation.
PRODUCTIVITY AND DEVELOPMENT
We continually invest in our people’s personal and professional development because we recognize their success is our success. Every year, employees are provided a range of development opportunities through a variety of channels, including: educational reimbursement programs; developmental relationships with mentors; rotational assignments; and Enbridge University, which offers a large catalog of courses.
