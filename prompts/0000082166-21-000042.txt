COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus 2019 (“COVID-19”) a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an unfavorable impact on certain areas of our business. The broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations remain uncertain and will depend on certain developments, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the availability, distribution, and effectiveness of vaccines to address the COVID-19 virus. The impact on our customers and suppliers and the range of governmental and community reactions to the pandemic are uncertain. The Company may continue to experience reduced customer demand or constrained supply that could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in future periods. 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company has three unique operating units, or divisions, that are also its reportable business segments ("segment" or "segments"): Applied Technology Division (Applied Technology), Engineered Films Division (Engineered Films), and Aerostar Division (Aerostar). Product lines have been generally grouped in these segments based on technology, manufacturing processes, and end-use application; however, a segment may serve more than one of the product markets identified above. The Company measures profitability and performance of its segments primarily based on their operating income excluding general and administrative expenses. Other income or expense and income taxes are not allocated to individual operating segments, and assets not identifiable to an individual segment are included as corporate assets. Segment information is reported consistent with the Company's management reporting structure.

Applied Technology
Applied Technology designs, manufactures, sells, and services innovative precision agriculture products and information management tools, which are collectively referred to as precision agriculture equipment, that focus on machine automation to help farmers reduce costs, more precisely control inputs, and improve farm yields for the global agriculture market. The Applied Technology product families include application controls, GPS-guidance steering systems, field computers, automatic boom controls, advanced machine automation including autonomous agriculture technology and platforms, information management tools, and injection systems. Applied Technology's services include high-speed in-field internet connectivity and cloud-based data management. 
Applied Technology sells its precision agriculture equipment to both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and through aftermarket distribution partners within agricultural markets both domestically and internationally. Applied Technology competes with other technology-based companies in a number of its product families and may compete with OEMs if they develop their own precision agriculture technology rather than purchase it from a third-party such as Raven. The Company's competitive advantage in this segment is designing and selling innovative, reliable, easy-to-use, and value-add products that are supported by an industry-leading service and support team.
The Company's Applied Technology Division continues to expand its Slingshot® communications platform. Slingshot improves logistics, communications, and application execution, driving business efficiencies for its agriculture retail partners. In January 2019, Applied Technology acquired the assets of AgSync, Inc. (AgSync), an agriculture logistics software company. This acquisition enhanced the division's Slingshot platform by delivering a logistics solution for ag retailers, custom applicators, and enterprise farms. 
The Company announced Raven Autonomy™ as a strategic growth initiative in November 2019 to become an industry leader in autonomous agricultural solutions through both technology and autonomous platforms. Raven Autonomy™ is the Company's expansion of its existing machine control technology through autonomous smart machine platforms and implements used in farming. The Company began executing on this strategic growth initiative in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 by acquiring Smart Ag, Inc. (Smart Ag®) and Dot Technology Corp. (DOT®). In fiscal 2021, the Company continued to make progress toward its goal to commercialize its first autonomous solutions in ag technology, allowing ag professionals to be more efficient in running their operations with less reliance on human decision making:
•acquired full voting control of DOT in the first quarter
•invested approximately $17 million in research and development and selling activities to drive commercialization 
•performed significant field testing, preparing for initial product launches for both the Dot® Power Platform and tractor autonomous power units (APUs) in fiscal 2022; 
•began accepting pre-orders for its first commercially available autonomous ag technology, AutoCart®, and established a new headquarters for Raven's business in Canada
Engineered Films
Engineered Films produces high-performance plastic films and sheeting for geomembrane, agricultural, construction, and industrial applications and also offers design-build and installation services of these plastic films and sheeting. Plastic film and sheeting can be purchased separately or together with installation services.
Engineered Films has various fabrication facilities in the United States (U.S.) to provide a heightened level of service and faster product delivery to customers of its geomembrane and construction products. In January 2020, the division expanded its fabrication capabilities to the East Coast, leasing a facility in Waynesboro, Virginia.
Engineered Films sells direct to end-customers and through independent third-party distributors. The majority of products sold into the construction and agriculture markets are sold through distributors, while sales into the geomembrane and industrial markets are generally sold to end-customers. The Company extrudes a significant portion of the film converted for its commercial products and believes it is one of the largest sheeting converters in the United States in the markets it serves. Engineered Films' ability to extrude and convert films, along with offering installation services for its geomembrane products, allows it to provide a more customized solution to customers. A number of film manufacturers compete with the Company on both price and product availability. 
In November 2019, the Company announced Raven Composites™ as a strategic growth platform for Engineered Films. Raven Composites™ is expected to build on the division's core strengths and expand Engineered Films to become an industry leader in the adjacent reinforced composites market. By leveraging the division's reinforced materials expertise, Engineered Films will develop a range of thinner, lighter, stronger rigid composite material that will include laminated layers of the division's surface films, resulting in superior finish characteristics on rigid materials for the transportation, construction, and industrial market 
4 



segments. The Company invested approximately $5 million in research and development equipment in fiscal 2021 to support new product development efforts for Raven Composites™. Larger scale manufacturing equipment to advance Raven Composites™ is on order and expected to be operational during the third quarter of fiscal 2022. 
Aerostar
Aerostar serves the aerospace and defense and commercial lighter-than-air markets. Aerostar's core products include high-altitude stratospheric platforms, technical services, and radar systems. These products can be integrated with additional third-party sensors to provide research, communications, and situational awareness capabilities to governmental and commercial customers. Aerostar’s growth strategy emphasizes the design and manufacture of proprietary products in these markets. Aerostar also pursues product and support services contracts with U.S. government agencies as well as sales of advanced radar systems in international markets. 

Aerostar sells to government agencies as both a prime contractor and subcontractor and to commercial users primarily as a sub-contractor. Aerostar competes with other technology companies that specialize in aerospace and defense and commercial products and services based on price, performance, and service.
MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK
In fiscal 2021, the Company made key advances across the enterprise and through the strategic platforms for growth. In response to the pandemic, the Company identified four priorities for the year that included upholding the Raven Way, emphasizing cash flow, protecting the core business, and aggressively investing in Raven Autonomy™. The Company successfully achieved these goals while managing the business through adverse economic conditions, supply chain constraints, and changing the Company's production processes to promote the health and well-being of team members.
The Company expects to advance on key milestones in fiscal 2022 within Raven Autonomy™, Raven Composites™, and Raven Thunderhead Balloon Systems, while leveraging the strength of our underlying businesses. The Company is focused on aggressively investing in its strategic platforms for growth, and the Company expects to make significant progress on the multi-year plan to drive a step-change in long-term growth. 
Applied Technology is expected to capitalize on the momentum generated during fiscal 2021 and drive continued revenue growth as the division leverages its industry-leading product portfolio and customer relationships. Order activity strengthened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and helped build momentum going into fiscal 2022. In addition, the Company is seeing strength in the agriculture industry as increasing commodity prices have created optimism in the ag market for the first time in several years. Through Raven Autonomy™, the Company expects to deliver AutoCart® systems in advance of the fall harvest and commercialize the Dot® Power Platform in fiscal 2022. The Company will continue to aggressively invest in Raven Autonomy™ as the Company builds the foundation for long-term growth. 
In Engineered Films, the Company has experienced improving conditions over the past few months. As conditions continue to improve, the Company expects to experience market share gains and drive meaningful year-over-year revenue growth. In fiscal 2022, the Company expects to pursue growth through acquisition as part of the strategy within Engineered Films to deliver high-value films and composites.
In Aerostar, the division significantly advanced the technology and capabilities of its stratospheric balloon systems over the past eight years as Alphabet's design partner for Loon. The relationship helped deliver connectivity to rural areas of the world and showcased the capabilities of its Thunderhead platform. Moving forward, the division is focused on bringing its stratospheric balloon platform to U.S. government agencies, providing a propriety solution for a variety of applications. In fiscal 2022, the division expects to build on the technology milestones it has achieved over recent months while executing on government contracts. Momentum around utilizing the stratosphere continues to grow, and as the leader in stratospheric technology, Aerostar is well-positioned to capitalize on the substantial opportunity.
MAJOR CUSTOMER INFORMATION
Sales to CNH Industrial, an OEM customer in the Applied Technology Division, accounted for 10% of the Company's consolidated net sales in fiscal year 2021. No customers accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal years 2020 or 2019.

SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
Some seasonal demand exists in both the Applied Technology and Engineered Films divisions, primarily due to their respective exposure to the agricultural market. However, given the overall diversification of the Company, the seasonal fluctuations in net working capital (accounts receivable, net plus inventories less accounts payable) are not usually significant.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The principal financial instruments the Company maintains include cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, marketable equity securities (related to the Company's deferred compensation plan liability), accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and acquisition-related contingent payments. The Company manages the interest rate, credit, and market risks associated with these accounts through periodic reviews of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and establishment of appropriate allowances in accordance with Company policies. 
The Company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency balance sheet risk. The use of these financial instruments has had no material effect on consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
RAW MATERIALS
The Company sources raw materials from a wide variety of suppliers, including numerous domestic and international vendors. The Company's principal raw materials include electronic components for Applied Technology and Aerostar, various polymeric resins for Engineered Films, and fabrics and film for Aerostar. The Company has experienced some volatility in raw material prices over the past three years. These price increases, including increased material costs or tariffs, could not always be passed on to customers due to weak demand and/or a competitive pricing environment. However, the overall impact was not material to the Company's financial position. 
PATENTS
The Company owns a number of patents and also owns licenses that allow the Company to gain access to certain patents of other companies. The Company does not believe that its business, as a whole, is materially dependent on any one patent or related group of patents. The Company focuses its significant research and development (R&D) efforts to develop technology-based offerings. As such, the protection of the Company’s intellectual property is an important strategic objective. Along with an aggressive posture toward patenting new technology and protecting trade secrets, the Company has restrictions on the disclosure of its technology to industry and business partners to ensure that its intellectual property is maintained and protected.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The three business segments conduct ongoing R&D efforts to improve their product offerings and develop new products. R&D investment is particularly strong within Applied Technology and Aerostar. New technology development and product enhancements within Applied Technology are a competitive differentiator and central to its long-term strategy. Engineered Films also utilizes R&D spending to develop new products, value engineer, and reformulate its current products. These R&D investments deliver high-value film solutions to the markets it serves, lower raw material consumption, and improve the quality of existing product lines. Aerostar's investment in the development of new technology has a particular emphasis on its core stratospheric balloon and radar platforms. The Company's total R&D costs are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company is subject to a wide variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations in the countries where it conducts business. Compliance with these laws and regulations requires training and dedication of time and effort by the Company's employees, as well as financial resources. In fiscal 2021, compliance with the regulations applicable to Raven did not have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Additional information about the impact of government regulations on the Company's business is included in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” under the heading Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks.

The Company believes that, in all material respects, it is in compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Expenditures incurred in the past relating to compliance for operating facilities have not significantly affected the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. The Company is unaware of any potential liabilities as of January 31, 2021, for any environmental matters that would have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
BACKLOG
The Company's backlog represents open customer orders and funded portions of signed government contracts. As of February 1, 2021, the Company's backlog totaled approximately $64 million. Backlog amounts as of February 1, 2020 and 2019, were approximately $60 million and $38 million, respectively. Because the length of time between order and shipment varies considerably by segment and customers can change delivery schedules or potentially cancel orders, the Company does not believe that backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period. However, the Company expects that any revenue generated from its backlog, as of February 1, 2021, will be recognized during fiscal year 2022.
HUMAN CAPITAL 
Raven believes its employees are essential to the organization’s success in solving great challenges. The Company depends on its highly skilled engineering, sales and service, and manufacturing teams to develop and deliver solutions to its customers. Raven has approximately 1,290 permanent employees as of January 31, 2021. Employees are primarily located throughout the United States with 6% of the Company’s workforce located internationally throughout Canada, Brazil, the Netherlands and Australia.
Talent
Raven’s talent strategy is focused on attracting the best talent, then recognizing and rewarding their performance, while continually developing, engaging, and retaining them. In fiscal 2021, Raven became Great Place to Work-Certified™. Using validated employee feedback gathered with Great Place to Work’s rigorous, data-driven methodology, certification confirms at least 7 out of 10 employees have a consistently positive experience at Raven. Surveyed in August 2020 on topics including their coworkers, their leaders, and their jobs, 85 percent of employees said that Raven is a great place to work, versus 59 percent at a typical company. Raven has a goal to be the employer of choice within the markets and communities it serves, and the Company strives to grow and develop the different capabilities and skills that are needed for the future, while also maintaining a robust pipeline of talent throughout the organization.
Raven is committed to promoting and cultivating an inclusive and diverse culture that welcomes and celebrates everyone without bias. The Company believes culture is the result of its behaviors, its commitment to personal accountability, its continuous improvement mindset, how its teams collaborate, and its employee’s ability appreciate one another’s contributions.
Total Rewards 
Raven believes that the Company must offer a comprehensive total rewards program for its employees to attract and retain a talented and experienced workforce. Raven regularly reviews its compensation and benefit plans to ensure they are competitive, align to Raven’s strategic priorities, and support company values. These programs not only include base wages and incentives in support of the Company's pay for performance culture, but also health, welfare, and retirement benefits. Raven focuses many programs on employee wellness and has implemented solutions including onsite wellness centers, onsite and virtual mental health support, telemedicine, and health and nutrition programs. Raven believes that these solutions have helped the Company successfully manage healthcare and prescription drug costs for its employee population. These solutions also promote a culture of Peak Performance — the Company’s commitment to prepare its employees as individuals as well as a corporation to be the best — and reinforce Raven’s belief that every individual is worthy and deserving of good mental well-being and health.
Development
Raven is growing and intends to do so every year. As the Company solves great challenges, Raven will continue to have a strong need for dynamic and successful leaders to carry out the expansion of the business. To meet this great need, Raven designed a system entitled "THRIVE" that allows teams, businesses, and leaders to thrive. THRIVE delivers a sustainable solution, wholly integrated into Raven’s culture and business model. Using several modes of development, THRIVE is designed to leverage the Company’s strong culture, clear set of values, and strategy of growth. THRIVE is intentionally built around three key areas — Raven, Business, and Leadership. THRIVE’s robust approach incorporates business skills and experiential learning, intentionally building competencies with specific Raven context. Incorporating business skills, university-level coursework, and relevant on-the-job experiences, THRIVE operates on a model of continual learning.
