 Item 1. Business
 Organization
 Sotherly Hotels Inc. (the “Company”) is a self-managed and self-administered lodging real estate investment trust, or REIT, that was formed in August 2004 to own, acquire, renovate and reposition full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotel properties located in primary markets in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States. On December 21, 2004, the Company successfully completed its initial public offering and elected to be treated as a self-advised REIT for federal income tax purposes. The Company conducts its business through Sotherly Hotels LP, its operating partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), of which the Company is the general partner. As of the filing date, the Company owns approximately 95.8% of the general and limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership. Limited partners own the remaining Operating Partnership units.
 As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio consisted of ten full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotels located in seven states with an aggregate of 2,786 hotel rooms, and interests in two condominium hotels and their associated rental programs. All of our hotels are wholly-owned by subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and are managed on a day-to-day basis by Our Town Hospitality, LLC (“Our Town”). Our portfolio is concentrated in markets that we believe possess multiple demand generators and have significant barriers to entry for new product delivery, which are important factors for us in identifying hotel properties that we expect will be capable of providing strong risk-adjusted returns.
 In order for the Company to qualify as a REIT, it cannot directly manage or operate our hotels. Therefore, we lease our wholly-owned hotel properties to entities that we refer to as our “TRS Lessees”, which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc. (“MHI Holding”, and collectively with the TRS Lessees, the “MHI TRS Entities”). The MHI TRS Entities, in turn, have engaged Our Town, which is an eligible independent management company, to manage the day-to-day operations at our hotels. MHI Holding is a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) for federal income tax purposes.
 Our corporate office is located at 306 South Henry Street, Suite 100, Williamsburg, Virginia 23185. Our telephone number is (757) 229-5648.
 Our Properties
 As of December 31, 2022, our hotels were located in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas. Seven of these hotels operate under franchise agreements with major hotel brands, and three are independent hotels. We also own the hotel commercial condominium units of the Hyde Resort & Residences and Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences condominium hotels. We closed the sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside on February 10, 2022 and the sale of the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone-University on June 10, 2022. See Item 2 in Part I and Item 7 in Part II of this Form 10-K for additional detail on our properties.
Our Strategy and Investment Criteria
 Our strategy is to grow through acquisitions of full-service, upscale and upper-upscale hotel properties located in the primary markets of the southern United States. Sotherly may also opportunistically acquire hotels throughout other regions of the United States. We intend to grow our portfolio through disciplined acquisitions of hotel properties and believe that we will be able to source significant external growth opportunities through our management team’s extensive network of industry, corporate and institutional relationships. Current market conditions and the terms of our loan agreements limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy, but as economic conditions improve and demand and consumer confidence increase, we intend to position the Company to execute on our growth strategy. We are not subject to limitations on the amount or percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property. Additionally, no limits have been set on the concentration of investments in any one location or facility type. Our policy is to acquire assets primarily for income and long-term appreciation.

Our investment criteria are further detailed below:
 •Geographic Growth Markets: Our growth strategy focuses on the major markets in the Southern region of the United States. Our management team remains confident in the long-term growth potential associated with this part of the United States. We believe these markets have, during the Company’s and our predecessors’ existence, been characterized by population growth, economic expansion, growth in new businesses and growth in the resort, recreation and leisure segments. We will continue to focus on these markets, including coastal locations, and will investigate other markets for acquisitions only if we believe these new markets will provide similar long-term growth prospects. Sotherly may also opportunistically acquire hotels throughout the United States.
 •Full-Service Hotels: Our acquisition strategy focuses on the full-service hotel segment. Our full-service hotels fall primarily under the upscale to upper-upscale categories and include such brands as Hilton, Doubletree by Hilton, and Hyatt, as well as independent hotels. We may also acquire commercial unit(s) within upscale to upper-upscale condominium hotel projects, allowing us to establish and operate unit rental programs. We do not own limited service or extended-stay hotels. We believe that full-service hotels, in the upscale to upper-upscale categories, will outperform the broader U.S. hotel industry, and thus offer the highest returns on invested capital. Sotherly may also opportunistically acquire hotels outside of the full-service, upscale or upper-upscale category.
 •Significant Barriers to Entry: We intend to execute a strategy that focuses on the acquisition of hotels in prime locations with significant barriers to entry.
 •Proximity to Demand Generators: We seek to acquire hotel properties located in central business districts for both leisure and business travelers within the respective markets, including large state universities, airports, convention centers, corporate headquarters, sports venues and office buildings. We seek to be in walking locations that are proximate to the markets’ major demand generators.
 We generally have a bias toward acquiring underperforming hotels, which we typically define as those that are poorly managed, suffer from significant deferred maintenance and capital investment and that are not properly positioned in their respective markets. In pursuing these opportunities, we hope to improve revenue and cash flow and increase the long-term value of the underperforming hotels we acquire. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a total investment that is substantially less than replacement cost of a hotel or the acquisition cost of a market performing hotel. In analyzing a potential investment in an underperforming hotel property, we typically characterize the investment opportunity as one of the following:
 •Branding Opportunity: The acquisition of properties that includes a repositioning of the property through a change in brand affiliation, which may include positioning the property as an independent hotel. Branding opportunities typically include physical upgrades and enhanced efficiencies brought about by changes in operations.
 •Shallow-Turn Opportunity: The acquisition of an underperforming but structurally sound hotel that requires moderate renovation to re-establish the hotel in its market.
 •Deep-Turn Opportunity: The acquisition of a hotel that is closed or functionally obsolete and requires a restructuring of both the business components of the operations as well as the physical plant of the hotel, including extensive renovation of the building, furniture, fixtures and equipment.
 Typically, in our experience, a deep turn opportunity takes a total of approximately four years from the initial acquisition of a property to achieving full post-renovation stabilization. Therefore, when evaluating future opportunities in underperforming hotels, we intend to focus on up-branding and shallow-turn opportunities, and to pursue deep-turn opportunities on a more limited basis and in joint venture partnerships, if possible.
 Investment Vehicles. In pursuit of our investment strategy, we may employ various traditional and non-traditional investment vehicles:
 •Direct Purchase Opportunity: Our traditional investment strategy is to acquire direct ownership interests via our Operating Partnership in properties that meet our investment criteria, including opportunities that involve full-service, upscale and upper-upscale properties in identified geographic growth markets that have significant barriers to entry for new product delivery. Such properties, or portfolio of properties, may or may not be acquired subject to a mortgage, or other financing or lending instruments, by the seller or third-party.
 •Joint Venture/Mezzanine Lending Opportunities: We may, from time to time, undertake a significant renovation and rehabilitation project that we characterize as a deep-turn opportunity. In such cases, we may acquire a functionally obsolete hotel whose renovation may be very lengthy and require significant capital. In these projects, we may choose to structure such acquisitions as a joint venture, or mezzanine lending program, in order to avoid severe short-term dilution and loss of current income commonly referred to as the “negative carry” associated with such extensive renovation 

programs. We will not pursue joint venture or mezzanine programs in which we would become a “de facto” lender to the real estate community.
 •Investments in Mortgages, Structured Financings and Other Lending Policies: In sourcing acquisitions for our core turnaround growth strategy, we may pursue investments in debt instruments that are collateralized by underperforming hotel properties. In certain circumstances, we believe that owning these debt instruments is a way to (i) ultimately acquire the underlying real estate asset and (ii) provide a non-dilutive current return to the Company’s stockholders in the form of interest payments derived from the ownership of the debt. Our principal goal in pursuing distressed debt opportunities is ultimately to acquire the underlying real estate. By owning the debt, we believe that we may be in a position to acquire deeds to properties that fit our investment criteria in lieu of foreclosures. We do not have a policy limiting our ability to invest in loans secured by properties or to make loans to other persons. We may consider offering purchase money financing in connection with the sale of properties where the provision of that financing will increase the value to be received by us for the property sold. We may make loans to joint ventures in which we may participate in the future. However, neither Sotherly nor the Operating Partnership intend to engage in significant lending activities.
 Portfolio and Asset Management Strategy
 We intend to ensure that the management of our hotel properties maximizes market share, as evidenced by revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) penetration indices, and that our market share yields the optimum level of revenues for our hotels in their respective markets. Our strategy is designed to actively monitor our hotels’ operating expenses in an effort to maximize hotel earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Hotel EBITDA”).
 Over our long history in the lodging industry, we have refined many portfolio and asset management techniques that we believe provide for exceptional cash returns at our hotels. We undertake extensive budgeting due diligence wherein we examine market trends, one-time or exceptional revenue opportunities, and/or changes in the regulatory climate that may impact costs. We review daily revenue results and revenue management strategies at the hotels, and we focus on our managers’ ability to produce high quality revenues that translate to higher profit margins. We look for ancillary forms of revenues, such as leasing roof-top space for cellular towers and other communication devices and also look to lease space to third parties in our hotels, which may include, but are not limited to, gift shops or restaurants. We have and will continue to engage parking management companies to maximize parking revenue. Our efforts further include periodic review of property insurance costs and coverage, and the cost of real and personal property taxes. We generally appeal tax increases in an effort to secure lower tax payments and routinely pursue strategies that allow for lower overall insurance costs, such as purchasing re-insurance.
 We also require detailed and refined reporting data from our hotel manager, which includes detailed accounts of revenues, revenue segments, expenses and forecasts based on current and historic booking patterns. We also believe we optimize and successfully manage capital costs at our hotels while ensuring that adequate product standards are maintained to provide a positive guest experience.
 None of our hotels are managed by a major national or global hotel franchise company. Through our long history in the lodging industry, we have found that management of our hotels by management companies other than franchisors is preferable to and more profitable than management services provided by the major franchise companies, specifically with respect to optimization of operating expenses and the delivery of guest service.
 Our portfolio management strategy includes efforts to optimize labor costs. Our third-party hotel manager is responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels. Although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our hotels, we monitor our hotel manager and make recommendations regarding the operation of our hotels. The labor force in our hotels is predominately non-unionized, with only one property, the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, having approximately 86 employees electing to participate under a collective bargaining arrangement. Further, the employees at our hotels that are managed by Our Town are eligible to receive health and other insurance coverage through Our Town, which self-insures. Self-insuring has, in our opinion and experience, provided significant savings over traditional insurance company sponsored plans.
 Asset Disposition Strategy. When a property no longer fits with our investment objectives, we will pursue a direct sale of the property for cash so that our investment capital can be redeployed according to the investment strategies outlined above. Where possible, we will seek to subsequently purchase a hotel in connection with the requirements of a tax-free exchange. Such a strategy may be deployed in order to mitigate the tax consequence that a direct sale may cause.

 Agreements with Our Town. Our Town is the management company for each of our twelve wholly-owned hotels, as well as the manager for our two condominium rental programs. As of March 15, 2022, an affiliate of Andrew M. Sims, our Chairman, an affiliate of David R. Folsom, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Andrew M. Sims Jr., our Vice President - Operations & Investor Relations, beneficially owned approximately 63.0%, 7.0%, and 15.0%, respectively, of the total outstanding ownership interests in Our Town. Mr. Sims, Mr. Folsom, and Mr. Sims Jr. serve as directors of Our Town.
 On September 6, 2019, we entered into a master agreement with Our Town and the former majority owner of Our Town related to the management of certain of our hotels, as amended on December 13, 2019 (as amended, the “OTH Master Agreement”). On December 13, 2019, and subsequent dates we entered into a series of individual hotel management agreements for the management of our hotels. Those hotel management agreements for our ten wholly-owned hotels and the two rental programs are each referred to as an “OTH Hotel Management Agreement” and, together, the “OTH Hotel Management Agreements”.
 The OTH Master Agreement:
 •expires on March 31, 2035, or earlier if all of the OTH Hotel Management Agreements expire or are terminated prior to that date. The OTH Master Agreement shall be extended beyond 2035 for such additional periods as an OTH Hotel Management Agreement remains in effect;
 •requires Our Town to provide dedicated executive level support for our managed hotels pursuant to certain criteria;
 •sets an incentive management fee for each of the hotels managed by Our Town equal to 10% of the amount by which gross operating profit, as defined in the OTH Hotel Management Agreements, for a given year exceeds the budgeted gross operating profit for such year; provided, however, that the incentive management fee payable in respect of any such year shall not exceed 0.25% of the gross revenues of the hotel included in such calculation;
 •provides for an adjustment to the fees payable by us under the OTH Hotel Management Agreements in the event the net operating income of Our Town falls below $250,000 for any calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2021;
 •provides a mechanism and establishes conditions on which the Company will offer Our Town the opportunity to manage hotels acquired by the Company in the future, pursuant to a negotiated form of single facility management agreement, with the caveat that the Company is not required to offer the management of future hotels to Our Town; and

•sets a base management fee for future hotels of 2.00% for the first year of the term, 2.25% for the second year of the term, and 2.50% for the third and any additional years of the term.
 Each of the OTH Hotel Management Agreements has an initial term ending March 31, 2035. Each of the OTH Hotel Management Agreements may be extended for up to two additional periods of five years subject to the approval of both parties with respect to any such extension. The agreements provide that Our Town will be the sole and exclusive manager of the hotels as the agent of the respective TRS Lessee, at the sole cost and expense of the TRS Lessee, and subject to certain operating standards. Each OTH Hotel Management Agreement may be terminated in connection with a sale of the related hotel. In connection with a termination upon the sale of the hotel, Our Town will be entitled to receive a termination fee equal to the lesser of the management fee paid with respect to the prior twelve months or the management fees paid for that number of months prior to the closing date of the hotel sale equal to the number of months remaining on the current term of the OTH Hotel Management Agreement. Upon the sale of a hotel, no termination fee will be due in the event the Company elects to provide Our Town with the opportunity to manage another comparable hotel and Our Town is not precluded from accepting such opportunity. Our Town is required to qualify as an eligible independent contractor in order to permit the Company to continue to operate as a real estate investment trust.
 Pursuant to the management agreements for the Hyde Resort & Residences and the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences, Our Town manages the rental of individually owned condominium units pursuant to rental agreements entered into with individual condominium unit owners. We have also entered into an Association Sub Management and Assignment Agreement with Our Town for the management and operation of the condominium association responsible for the operation of the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences, and a Rental Sales Management Agreement pursuant to which Our Town agreed to manage the marketing and negotiation of rental agreements with individual condominium unit owners.
 Franchise Agreements
 As of December 31, 2022, all but three of our wholly-owned hotels operate under franchise licenses from national hotel companies. As our franchise agreements expire, we will continue to evaluate each hotel on a case-by-case basis and decide whether to re-license with the existing franchisor, re-brand and license with a new franchisor, or re-brand as an independent hotel. We also periodically review our independent hotels to determine whether they would be better served by operating under a franchise license.
 Our TRS Lessees hold the franchise licenses for our wholly-owned hotels. Our hotel manager must operate each of our hotels they manage in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement for the hotel.
 The franchise licenses generally specify certain management, operational, record keeping, accounting, reporting and marketing standards and procedures with which the franchisee must comply. Under the franchise licenses, the franchisee must comply with the franchisors’ standards and requirements with respect to:
 •training of operational personnel;
 •safety;
 •maintaining specified insurance;
 •the types of services and products ancillary to guest room services that may be provided;
 •display of signage;
 •marketing standards including print media, billboards, and promotions standards; and
 •the type, quality and age of furniture, fixtures and equipment included in guest rooms, lobbies and other common areas.
 As the franchisee, our TRS Lessees are required to pay franchise/royalty fees, as well as certain other fees for marketing and reservations services in amounts that range from approximately 3.0% to 4.0% of gross revenues. The following table sets forth certain information for the franchise licenses of our wholly-owned hotel properties as of December 31, 2022:



 | Franchise/Royalty | | | Expiration
 | Fee (1) | | | Date 
Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton (2) | | 5.0 | % | | June 2029 
DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront | | 5.0 | % | | September 2025
DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel | | 5.0 | % | | October 2030 
DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia – Airport | | 5.0 | % | | October 2024 
DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach | | 5.0 | % | | October 2027 
Hotel Ballast Wilmington, Tapestry Collection by Hilton (2) | | 5.0 | % | | April 2028 
Hyatt Centric Arlington | | 5.0 | % | | March 2038 

 (1) Percentage of room revenues payable to the franchisor.
 (2) The Franchise/Royalty Fee is 3.0% for operating year 1, 4.0% for operating year 2, and 5.0% thereafter.
 Lease Agreements
  TRS Leases
 In order for the Company to maintain qualification as a REIT, neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries can operate our hotels directly. Our wholly-owned hotels are leased to our TRS Lessees, which have engaged a third-party management company to manage the hotels. Each lease has a non-cancelable term ranging from four to thirty years, subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain contingencies described in the lease.
 During the term of each lease, our TRS Lessees are obligated to pay a fixed annual base rent plus a percentage rent and certain other additional charges. Base rent accrues and is paid monthly. Percentage rent is calculated by multiplying fixed percentages by gross room revenues, in excess of certain threshold amounts and is paid monthly or quarterly, according to the terms of the agreement.
  Other Leases
 We lease the land underlying the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel pursuant to a ground lease. The ground lease requires us to make rental payments of $50,000 per year in base rent and percentage rent equal to 3.5% of gross room revenue in excess of certain thresholds, as defined in the ground lease agreement. The ground lease contains a rent reset provision that will reset the rent in June 2025 to a fixed amount per annum equal to 8.0% of the land value, subject to an appraisal process. The initial term of the ground lease expires in 2035 and may be extended by us for four additional renewal periods of 10 years each. In order to sell the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel and assign our leasehold interest in the ground lease, we are required to obtain the consent of the third-party lessor.
 In connection with the acquisition of the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences hotel commercial condominium unit, we entered into a 20-year parking and cabana management agreement for the parking garage and poolside cabanas associated with the resort. In exchange for rights to the parking and cabana revenue, we pay the condominium association an annual payment of $271,000 for the initial five years of the term, with 5.0% increases on every fifth year of the term.
 We lease approximately 8,500 square feet of commercial office space in Williamsburg, Virginia for our corporate offices, under an agreement with a ten-year term beginning January 1, 2020. The initial annual rent under the agreement is $218,875, with the rent for each successive annual period increasing by 3.0% over the prior annual period’s rent. The annual rent was offset by a tenant improvement allowance of $200,000, applied against one-half of each monthly rent payment until the tenant improvement allowance was exhausted in 2021.
 Tax Status
 The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2004. In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute, as “qualifying distributions,” at least 90.0% of its taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding its net capital gains and reduced by certain non-cash items) to its stockholders. The Company has adhered to these requirements each taxable year since its formation in 2004 and intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of its taxable income (including its net capital gain) that is distributed to its stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and no relief provision applies, it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and it would be disqualified from re-electing treatment as a REIT until the fifth taxable year after the year in which it failed to
qualify as a REIT. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, is subject to federal, state and local income taxes.
 While the Operating Partnership is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes, the unit holders of the Operating Partnership, including the Company, are subject to tax on their respective allocable shares of the Operating Partnership’s taxable income.
 The Company has one TRS, MHI Holding, in which it owns an interest through the Operating Partnership. MHI Holding is subject to federal, state and local income taxes. MHI Holding has operated at a cumulative taxable loss, through December 31, 2022, of approximately $41.7 million and deferred timing differences of approximately $1.7 million attributable to accrued, but not deductible, vacation and sick pay amounts, business interest, depreciation and other timing differences. The Company has not incurred federal income taxes since its formation. During the first quarter of 2020, we reduced our deferred tax assets through the establishment of a 100% valuation allowance of approximately $5.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we increased the valuation allowance to approximately $14.7 million and increased it again during the year ended December 31, 2021 to approximately $14.9 million and in 2022 we reduced the valuation allowance by approximately $3.7 million to approximately $11.2 million.
 Environmental Matters
 In connection with the ownership and operation of the hotels, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under these laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on, under, or in such property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, the presence of contamination from hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remediate such contaminated property properly, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to borrow using such property as collateral. Furthermore, a person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous or toxic substance at a property owned by another, or who transports such substance to or from such property, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substance released into the environment at the disposal or treatment facility. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In connection with the ownership and operation of the hotels, we may be potentially liable for such costs.
 We believe that our hotels are in compliance, in all material respects, with all federal, state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters, the violation of which would have a material adverse effect on us. We have not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our present hotel properties.
 Employees and Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed nine full-time persons, all of whom work at our corporate office in Williamsburg, Virginia. We believe relations with our employees are positive. Our human capital resources objectives include attracting and retaining talented and well-qualified employees. Our compensation program, including competitive salaries and other benefits, are designed to attract, hire, retain and motivate highly qualified employees and executives. We are committed to enhancing our culture through efforts to promote and preserve inclusion and by providing and maintaining a safe work environment. All persons employed in the day-to-day operations of each of our hotels are employees of our third-party hotel manager engaged by our TRS Lessees to operate such hotels.
