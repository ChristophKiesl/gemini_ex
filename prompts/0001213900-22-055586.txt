Historical Development



LZG International, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Florida on May 22, 2000, as LazyGrocer.Com, Inc. On August 28, 2009, the Company’s name was changed to LZG International, Inc. Prior to the transaction on October 23, 2021, the Company was a blank check company and had limited operations.



On October 23, 2021, the Company executed an “IT Asset Purchase Agreement” with FatBrain, LLC, a previously unrelated entity, for certain intellectual properties, including patents pending, proprietary technology, licenses, software, development plans and contractual rights. The intellectual property is comprised of an AI Technology with many commercial applications, the first being “Angelina FX”. As consideration, the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of common stock to FatBrain, LLC’s material non-controlling member, Peter B. Ritz. The mutually agreed upon asset fair market value of $348,000 was allocated 100% to the Angelina FX software due to the assignment of contractual rights to the Company of a licensing agreement previously entered into on May 7, 2021, between FatBrain and a non-related party, Tempus, Inc. This transaction resulted in a change in control of the Company, whereby Mr. Ritz is the owner of 97.6% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock.



The FatBrain IT Assets acquired in the IT Asset Purchase Agreement include software that uses artificial intelligence to help companies automate enterprise decision cycles to learn, explain and intervene for better outcomes across all business interactions. The software continuously learns from historical transactions, incumbent models and in-house expert teams to deliver a unified framework binding structured and unstructured data in text, numerical, network/graph and video formats. The FatBrain software leverages modern advances in machine learning and cloud economics to enable sustained operational advantages of (i) simplicity with smaller, denser models using vector embeddings, (ii) auditability with explainable, trusted quantification and de-biasing using blockchain, (iii) quality work with noisy, sparse, imbalances or missing date using generative autoencoders, and (iv) technology using transfer and active learning. The Company has initiated the commercialization of the technology and we have spoken to several potential clients.
