ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

Overview
 
H-CYTE, Inc is a hybrid-biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and delivering new treatments for patients with chronic respiratory and pulmonary disorders. During the last 18 months, the Company has evolved into two separate verticals under its Healthcare Medical Biosciences Division with its entrance into the biologics development space (“Biologics Vertical”). This new vertical is complementary to the Company’s current Lung Health Institute (LHI) autologous infusion therapy business (“Infusion Vertical”) and is focused on underserved disease states.
 
On July 11, 2019, MedoveX Corp. (“MedoveX”) changed its name to H-CYTE, Inc. (“H-CYTE” or the “Company”) by filing a Certificate of Amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) with the Secretary of the State of Nevada. The name change and the Company’s new symbol, HCYT, became effective with FINRA on July 15, 2019. H-CYTE was incorporated in Nevada on July 30, 2013 as SpineZ Corp.
 
On October 18, 2018, H-CYTE (formerly named MedoveX) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) with Regenerative Medicine Solutions, LLC, RMS Shareholder, LLC (“Shareholder”), Lung Institute LLC (“LI”), RMS Lung Institute Management LLC (“RMS LI Management”) and Cognitive Health Institute Tampa, LLC (“CHIT”), (collectively “RMS”). On January 8, 2019, the APA was amended, and the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of RMS as reported in the 8-K/A filed in March of 2019. Based on the terms of the APA and its amendment (collectively the “APA”), the former RMS members had voting control of the combined company as of the closing of the RMS acquisition. For accounting purposes, the acquisition transaction has been treated as a reverse acquisition whereby the Company is deemed to have been acquired by RMS and the historical financial statements prior to the acquisition date of January 8, 2019 now reflect the historical financial statements of RMS.
 
The Company has two divisions: the Healthcare Medical Biosciences Division (“which includes the Infusion Vertical and the Biologics Vertical”) and the DenerveX medical device division (“DenerveX”). The Company has decided to focus its available resources on the Healthcare Medical Biosciences Division as it represents a significantly greater opportunity than the DenerveX division. The Company is no longer manufacturing or selling the DenerveX device but continues to explore possible opportunities to monetize such technology.
 
As of the merger, the consolidated results for H-CYTE include the following wholly-owned subsidiaries: H-CYTE Management, LLC (formerly Blue Zone Health Management, LLC), MedoveX Corp, Cognitive Health Institute, LLC, and Lung Institute Tampa, LLC (formerly Blue Zone Lung Tampa, LLC) and the results included Lung Institute Dallas, PLLC (“LI Dallas”), Lung Institute Nashville, PLLC (“LI Nashville”), Lung Institute Pittsburgh, PLLC (“LI Pittsburgh”), and Lung Institute Scottsdale, LLC (“LI Scottsdale”), as Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”). H-CYTE Management, LLC is the operator and manager of the various Lung Health Institute (LHI) clinics: LI Dallas, LI Nashville, LI Pittsburgh, and LI Scottsdale.
 
Impact of COVID-19
 
The coronavirus outbreak (“COVID-19”) has adversely affected the Company’s financial condition and results of operations in 2020. The impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on the businesses and the economy in the United States and the rest of the world is and is expected to continue to be significant. The extent to which COVID-19 outbreak will continue to impact business and the economy is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict the extent to which its financial condition and results of operation will be affected. The Company took steps to protect its vulnerable patient base (elderly patients suffering from chronic lung disease) by cancelling all treatments effective March 23, 2020 through the end of July 2020. The Company made the decision in late March 2020, to layoff approximately 40% of its employee base, including corporate and clinical employees and to cease operations at the LHI clinics in Tampa, Nashville, Scottsdale, Pittsburgh, and Dallas. The Company reopened operations in August 2020 at its clinics in Tampa, Nashville, and Scottsdale. The clinics in Pittsburgh and Dallas did not reopen and were closed permanently.

The Company believed these expense reductions were necessary during the unexpected COVID-19 pandemic. Due to COVID-19, the Company was not able to generate revenue from March 23, 2020 until August 2020. With the Company’s revenue-generating activities suspended for a portion of 2020 and the negative impact that COVID-19 has had on its medical biosciences division, the Company will need to raise cash from debt and equity offerings to continue its operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in doing so. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity.
 
The Company has updated its business model to decrease corporate overhead and marketing expense to significantly reduce expenses. The Company believes as COVID-19 begins to dissipate due to vaccinations being administered nationwide, as well as herd immunity, patients will again begin to travel to one of the LHI clinics for treatment. The Company continues to focus on developing a new FDA approved biologic for the treatment of chronic lung disease.
 
Company’s Two Operating Divisions
 
The Company has two divisions: the Healthcare Medical Biosciences Division (“which includes the Infusion Vertical and the Biologics Vertical”) and the DenerveX medical device division (“DenerveX”). The Company has decided to focus its available resources on the Healthcare Medical Biosciences Division as it represents a significantly greater opportunity than the DenerveX division. The Company is no longer manufacturing or selling the DenerveX device but continues to explore possible opportunities to monetize such technology.
Healthcare Medical Biosciences Division (Biosciences Division)
 
Autologous Infusion Therapy (“Infusion Vertical”)
 
The Company’s Biosciences Division includes the Infusion Vertical that develops and implements innovative treatment options in autologous cellular therapy (PRP-PBMC) to treat chronic lung disorders. Committed to an individualized patient-centric approach, this division consistently provides oversight and management of the highest quality care to the LHI clinics located in Tampa, Nashville, and Scottsdale, while producing positive medical outcomes following the strictest CDC guidelines.
Biotech Development Division (“Biologics Vertical”)
 
On June 21, 2019, H-CYTE entered into an exclusive product supply agreement with Rion, LLC (“Rion”) to develop and distribute (post FDA approval) a biologic for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”), the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. Rion has established a novel biologics technology to harness the healing power of the body. Rion’s innovative technology, based on science developed at Mayo Clinic, provides an off-the-shelf platform to enhance healing in soft tissue, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and neurological organ systems. This agreement provides for a 10-year exclusive and extendable supply agreement with Rion to enable H-CYTE to develop proprietary biologics.
 
On October 9, 2019, the Company entered into a services agreement with Rion which provides the Company the benefit of Rion’s resources and expertise for the limited purpose of (i) consulting with and assisting H-CYTE in the further research and development for the generation of a new biologic and (ii) subsequently assisting H-CYTE in seeking and obtaining FDA Phase 1 IND clearance for this biologic as necessary. Rion also agrees to consult with H-CYTE in its arrangement for services from third parties unaffiliated with Rion to support research, development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of the biologic.
 
With these agreements, Rion will serve as the product supplier and contracted preclinical development arm of the biologic. H-CYTE will control the commercial development and the clinical trial investigation. After conducting the clinical efficacy trials of this biologic, H-CYTE intends to pursue submission of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for review by the FDA for treatment of COPD.

The following information pertains to the Biosciences Division:
 
Competition
 
Developing and commercializing new FDA approved drugs and therapies is highly competitive. The market is characterized by extensive research and clinical efforts and rapid technological change. The Company faces intense competition worldwide from pharmaceutical, biomedical technology, medical therapy, and combination products companies, including major pharmaceutical companies. The Company may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products. Most of the Company’s existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing and distribution, and technological resources. These competitors may also be in the process of seeking FDA (or other regulatory approvals) and patent protection for new products. The Company’s biologics product lines also face competition from numerous existing products and procedures, which currently are considered part of the standard of care. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in its markets are:

● | determining and progressing suitable biological therapies for specific disease states the quality of outcomes for medical conditions; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | acceptance by physicians and the medical community; 
● | ease of use and reliability; 
● | technical leadership and superiority; 
● | effective marketing and distribution; 
● | speed to market; and 
● | price and qualification for insurance coverage and reimbursement. 

 
The Company will also compete in the marketplace to recruit qualified scientific, management and sales personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and licenses complementary to its products or advantageous to its business.
 
The Company is aware that several of its competitors are developing technologies in its current and future products areas. There are numerous regenerative medicine providers who make unsubstantiated claims that they are able to treat chronic lung disease. Most of these competitors are small clinics with little brand recognition. The landscape is changing as pharma and biologics companies, as well as academia such as the Mayo Clinic, begin to develop therapies for multiple diseases using regenerative medicine through the more stringent regulatory pathway of a BLA.
 
Customers
 
The Company’s customer base consists of individuals who are suffering from chronic lung disease that are searching for alternative or adjunct forms of treatment outside of traditional pharmaceutical care which has not been successful for them in the past.
Intellectual Property
 
The Company’s Infusion Vertical is currently a direct care service provider and does not own any intellectual property around its current procedure. The development of a biologic is ongoing and is projected to start the FDA approval process in 2021. H-CYTE has a ten-year exclusive licensing agreement with Rion and will therefore be protected by Rion’s intellectual property filings.
Government Regulations
 
Governmental authorities in the U.S. (at the federal, state and local levels) and abroad, extensively regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, and export and import of products such as those we are developing.

FDA Regulation
 
The Infusion Vertical’s current cellular therapy for chronic lung disease does not require FDA approval due to it being an autologous therapy. The biologic therapy should begin clinical development in 2021. The biologic therapy will need to be approved by the FDA before it is marketed in the U.S. During the FDA’s BLA approval process, the Company’s biologic therapy will be subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or the Public Health Service Act, as well as by other regulatory bodies.
 
FDA regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, record-keeping, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, sales and marketing, and distribution of medical devices and products.
 
In the U.S., the FDA subjects pharmaceutical and biologic products to rigorous review. If the Company does not comply with applicable requirements, it may be fined, the government may refuse to approve its marketing applications or to allow it to manufacture or market its products, and the Company may be criminally prosecuted. Failure to comply with the law could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a product, product recall, product seizure, interruption of production, operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of product approval, injunctions, or criminal prosecution.
 
Proprietary Medical Device Business (DenerveX division)
 
The Company’s business of designing and marketing proprietary medical devices for commercial use in the U.S. and Europe began operations in late 2013. The Company received CE marking in June 2017 for the DenerveX System and it became commercially available throughout the European Union and several other countries that accept CE marking. The Company’s first sale of the DenerveX System occurred in July 2017. The Company marketed the DenerveX Device as a disposable, single-use kit which includes all components of the DenerveX device product. In addition to the DenerveX device itself, the Company developed a dedicated Electro Surgical Generator, the DenerveX Pro-40, to power the DenerveX device. There is currently no finished product of the DenerveX device in inventory as commercial production has been suspended since the first quarter of 2019. There was minimal revenue from the DenerveX product in 2020.
 
In the first quarter of 2020, the Company made the decision to stop any further efforts to source alternative manufacturing and distributor options for the DenerveX product. The Company has decided to focus its available resources on the Biosciences division as this division presents a significantly greater opportunity. Although the Company is no longer manufacturing or selling the DenerveX device, it does continue to explore possible opportunities to monetize such technology.
 
Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”)
 
United States Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws
 
In the U. S., there are Federal and State anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in Federal healthcare programs. These laws are potentially applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA as pharmaceuticals, biologics, medical devices, and hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products. Other provisions of Federal and State laws provide civil and criminal penalties for presenting, or causing to be presented, to third-party payers for reimbursement, claims that are false or fraudulent, or which are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. In addition, certain states have implemented regulations requiring medical device and pharmaceutical companies to report all gifts and payments of over $50 to medical practitioners. This does not apply to instances involving clinical trials.
 
Although the Company intends to structure its future business relationships with clinical investigators and purchasers of its products to comply with these and other applicable laws, it is possible that some of the Company’s business practices in the future could be subject to scrutiny and challenged by Federal or State enforcement officials under these laws.
