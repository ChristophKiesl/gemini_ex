ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW



We are a holding company organized under the laws of Ontario, Canada, that is engaged in various aspects of the oil and gas industry. Our primary focus is on the development and implementation of our proprietary oil sands mining and processing technology to recover oil from surface mined bitumen deposits. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Petroteq Energy CA, Inc., a California corporation (“PCA”), conducts our oil sands extraction business through two wholly owned operating companies, Petroteq Oil Recovery, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“POR”), and TMC Capital, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“TMC Capital”). Another subsidiary, Petrobloq LLC, a California limited liability company (“Petrobloq”), also wholly owned by Petroteq, is currently dormant.
Oil Sands & Processing



Through PCA, our wholly-owned subsidiary, and PCA’s two subsidiaries POR and TMC Capital, we are in the business of exploring for, extracting and producing oil and hydrocarbon products from oil sands deposits and sediments located in the Asphalt Ridge Are of Uintah County, Utah, utilizing our proprietary extraction technology (the “Petroteq Clean Oil Recovery Technology” or “Extraction Technology”). Our primary oil sands extraction and processing operations are conducted at our Asphalt Ridge processing facility (herein the “Asphalt Ridge Plant” or “Plant”), which is owned by POR.



Petroteq owns the intellectual property rights to the Petroteq Clean Oil Recovery Technology which is used at our Asphalt Ridge Plant to extract and produce crude oil from oil sands utilizing a closed-loop solvent based extraction system.



The Asphalt Ridge Plant initially commenced operations as a pilot plant in 2015 at a site near Maeser, Utah, but was relocated in 2017 to a site near our Asphalt Ridge Mine #1 located on lands a Mining and Mineral Lease Agreement dated as of July 1, 2013, between Asphalt Ridge, Inc., as lessor, and TMC, as lessee, (the “TMC Mineral Lease”). The relocation of the Plant near our existing mine site was designed to improve logistical and processing efficiencies in the oil sands recovery process. The relocation of the Plant occurred during a temporary suspension of our mining and processing operations in 2016 that resulted from a sharp decline in world oil prices. We restarted operations at the end of May 2018 and completed expansion work on the Plant to increase production capacity to 400-500 barrels of oil per day during the last quarter of fiscal 2019 (the quarter ended August 31, 2019). During our testing of the Plant and its increased production capacity during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 (the quarter ending November 30, 2019), we determined that a number of equipment upgrades were required to support continuous operation of the Plant. As discussed below, these upgrades were completed in December 2020.



We had expected to generate revenue from the sale of hydrocarbon products from the Asphalt Ridge Plant commencing in the third quarter ending May 31, 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and volatility in oil prices, we reduced operations to a single shift per day during the quarter ending February 29, 2020 and ultimately suspended operations at the Plant during the quarter ending May 31, 2020.



In July 2020, Greenfield Energy LLC (“Greenfield”), a joint venture company formed by TomCo Energy PLC, a UK energy company, and Valkor LLC (“Valkor”), a Texaco limited liability company, assumed the management and operation of the Asphalt Ridge Plant. Under a Technology License Agreement dated July 2, 2019, Petroteq granted to Valkor a non-exclusive license and right to use Petroteq’s Clean Oil Recovery Technology in operations conducted at the Plant. Since July 2020, Greenfield has implemented various upgrades to the Plant to improve operating capacity and reliability and began testing to assess the commerciality of the Plant and Petroteq’s proprietary technology. To improve operational capability during winter months, Greenfield also arranged for buildings to be erected over the nitrogen system and the vapor recovery system and for wind-walls were erected at the mixing tank area and decanter deck at the Plant.

Following the startup of the Plant in January 2021, we determined that certain additional equipment would be required to improve the process of extracting bitumen from oil sands ore and the removal of clay fines from produced oil. The additional equipment was required to transition the plant to commercialization and to demonstrate the commerciality of both the Plant and Petroteq’s Clean Oil Recovery Technology. The required equipment was installed and commissioned and the Plant was restarted in April 2021. 



The first full load of oil produced by the Plant was sold in June 2021 by Valkor. The production and sale of the first load of oil from the Plant following a series of upgrades was an important milestone as it demonstrated that heavy oil from Utah oil sands can be produced economically using Petroteq’s Clean Oil Recovery Technology without the use of water and without any requirement for a tailings pond. The buyer paid West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (“WTI”) benchmark pricing of $70.91 per barrel for the 10.2° API heavy sweet crude oil produced by the Plant. The fact that we received WTI pricing for the oil produced by the Plant demonstrates that the heavy sweet (low sulfur) oil produced from Utah’s oil sands in the Asphalt Ridge area will likely command a premium price relative to other heavy oils.



The 2021 FEED Design Platform 



In July 2021, Crosstrails Engineering LLC completed a Front End Engineering Design (the “2021 FEED”) for a 5,000 barrel per day (“BPD”) production train that could be constructed either at the site of the Asphalt Ridge Plant or as a separate oil sands processing facility at an undeveloped site. The 2021 FEED describes the design data, design requirements, detailed major equipment requirement, and general operating philosophies for the development of a 5,000 BPD production train, including a Class 3 (± 25%) cost estimate of approximately $110 million for construction of a new commercial plant as a separate facility. The cost estimates in the 2021 FEED suggest a capital cost of $22,000 per daily barrel of production. A new oil sands processing facility based on the 2021 FEED will consist of an initial 5,000 BPD production train but provides for a possible future expansion to 10,000 BPD through the addition of a second parallel 5,000 BPD train. The capital cost of $22,000 per daily barrel for an initial 5,000 BPD production train installed either as an adjunct to the existing Asphalt Ridge Plant or as a separate processing facility on an undeveloped site compares very favorably with the construction costs of plants and facilities that deploy more traditional methods of extracting bitumen and heavy oil from oil sands.



Preliminary estimates for the longest lead time for procuring equipment for a new 5,000 BPD production train under the 2021 FEED are approximately 48-54 weeks. The overall engineering, procurement and construction of a 5,000 BPD plant are estimated to require 54-62 weeks, barring any significant supply chain upsets or adverse weather conditions during construction and commissioning of the plant. Once constructed and operating, it is estimated that each production train will employ 40-50 persons between mining and plant operations.



Petroteq anticipates that the 2021 FEED may provide the basis for a standard design package for 5,000 BPD production trains constructed by Petroteq or by its technology licensees in Utah and in other parts of the United States and other countries having oil sands and other structures holding substantial bitumen and heavy oil resources. Any standard design package developed from the 2021 Feed may require a certain amount of customization for local site conditions and ore characteristics, but the differences are not expected to be significant.



Status of Mining & Processing Operations 



After the April 2021 restart, the Asphalt Ridge Plant was operated intermittently until August 2021, when operations were suspended to allow the Company and its engineering firms to conduct a detailed inspection of the Plant for the purpose of determining whether the Plant’s equipment, and the configuration of its units, would permit the integration or auxiliary construction of a new 5,000 BPD production training based on the 2021 FEED. During this period, exploratory core sampling and testing was conducted of the oil sands resources at Asphalt Mine #1.



Based on the inspections of the Plant’s units and equipment and evaluations of core data taken from areas at and around Asphalt Ridge Mine #1, the Company preliminarily decided, subject to further study and evaluation, to (a) construct a separate 5,000 BPD oil sands processing plant, with the option of adding a second 5,000 BPD production train, on an undeveloped site in the Asphalt Ridge area (and not as an expansion to the existing Plant), (b) continue to operate the Asphalt Ridge Plant where economic conditions support commercial operations, and (c) to augment the supply of oil sands ore from Asphalt Mine #1 as feedstock for the Plant to higher quality oil sands ores and sediments mined or produced from other leases and properties in the Asphalt Ridge area.

In September 2021, we initiated discussions with Valkor for the purpose of developing a long term oil sands ore supply contract with Greenfield for the purchase of oil sands ores produced from mineral leases held or managed by Greenfield in the Asphalt Ridge Northwest area.



The Plant is currently in a winterized shut-down, although it may be restarted and operated upon short notice for demonstration purposes and for the purpose of testing and evaluating different oil sands ores and materials sources from different leases and properties in the Asphalt Ridge area. We currently anticipate that the Asphalt Ridge Plant will resume processing and production operations in February-March 2022. Upon resuming operations, the Plant will be operated primarily for the purpose of processing oil sands ores and bituminous sands sourced from both Asphalt Mine #1 and from Asphalt Ridge leases held or managed by Greenfield or Valkor, and potentially from other sources in the Asphalt Ridge area. The Plant will also be used for demonstration purposes for potential investors and prospective technology licensees and for the purpose of testing and evaluating oil sands and heavy oil source material produced from areas within the Uintah Basin in Utah and in other regions of the United States and other countries as such materials are made available to us.



Research and Development



The Asphalt Ridge Plant has proved that Petroteq’s Clean Oil Recovery Technology, including our redesigned extraction and production process, is capable of producing oil in marketable quantities and that a substantial portion of the “post processed” sand generated by our extraction and production operations may be sold for various uses. Petroteq continued to test ore from various oil sands deposits and resources in the Asphalt Ridge area of Utah, with varying degrees of oil quality and with oil saturations in the range of 5 to 10 percent by weight. Petroteq’s proprietary technology and extraction process has been successful in extracting oil from the different oil sands ores that we have tested, confirming that our oil extraction technology can accommodate a wide range of ore specifications.



During the fiscal year ending August 31, 2021, we engaged Kahuna Ventures LLC, an energy-focused project execution firm, to review the POSP operating data, process simulation data, and our 5,000 BPD FEED study. The technical evaluation conducted by Kahuna Ventures indicated extraction costs of approximately $13.50 per barrel of oil produced. With mining and ore transport costs adding another $8.50 per barrel, this suggests an estimated operating cost of approximately $22 per barrel of oil produced (prior to adjustment for corporate overhead, production related taxes and royalties). The estimated operating cost of $22 per produced barrel of oil does not take into account the reduction in net operating costs that may result from the sale of commercial marketable sand generated during our extraction and production operations, which we estimate could reduce our net operating costs, measured on a per barrel of oil produced basis, by as much as $10-15 per barrel.



Several barrels of produced oil from the Asphalt Ridge Plant have now been tested by Quadrise Fuels International plc in the United Kingdom for the purpose of assessing the suitability of the heavy sweet oil produced by the POSP for their MSAR® technology. MSAR® is a low viscosity oil-in-water emulsified synthetic heavy fuel oil (“HFO”). It is manufactured using Quadrise’s proprietary technology to mix heavy oils with small amounts of specialist chemicals and water to a bespoke formulation. According to Quadrise, the resulting emulsion contains approximately 30% water and less than 1% chemicals. The emulsion is a low viscosity liquid at room temperature, which makes it easier to handle and reduces the heating costs for storing, transportation and use in comparison to HFOs.



In September 2021, Quadrise reported that the testing program, which was completed at the Quadrise Research Facility ("QRF") in Essex, in the United Kingdom, confirmed the ability to produce commercial MSAR® and bioMSAR™ fuels from the sample of heavy sweet oil provided by Greenfield from the POSP and that a report of the testing results has been issued to the client.  Simulations of storage and handling of both MSAR® and bioMSAR™ produced were also completed during the program, which indicated that commercial production of MSAR® and bioMSAR™ fuels would be possible in Utah for potential power and marine end-user applications domestically and internationally. Quadrise further noted that this testing concluded the proof-of-concept work that was scheduled in Phase 1 of the Commercial Trial Agreement between Greenfield and Quadrise announced on August 18, 2020. Quadrise recently reported that Greenfield and Quadrise have entered into discussions regarding potential future trials and deployment of the technology to produce MSAR® and/or bioMSAR™ fuel at a commercial scale.

Petroteq continues to work with a local drilling fluids company to identify customers for the commercially marketable sand generated from the Asphalt Ridge Plant for use in oil and gas hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” operations. The fluids company has to date taken 340 tons of sand and it is expected that it will take the additional processed sand currently available, together with additional quantities of sand as and when they are produced at the Plant. The proceeds from the sale of sand are expected to be approximately $15-20 per ton ($10-15 per barrel).



As announced by Petroteq on November 17, 2020, Greenfield has executed a non-exclusive, multi-site license with Petroteq (the “Greenfield License”). The Greenfield License has been granted in consideration for $2,000,000 in funding that Greenfield has provided to date for upgrades to the Asphalt Ridge Plant. The Greenfield License will allow Greenfield to use Petroteq’s Clean Oil Recovery Technology in any future oil sands processing plants built by Greenfield in the United States. The Greenfield License provides that the ownership of any intellectual property developed as a result of upgrades to or operations conducted at the POSP, including associated trials and testing, will be owned by Petroteq. At the same time, any such intellectual property, including any oil sands technologies developed by Petroteq, will be included within the scope of the Greenfield License and may be used by Greenfield under the terms of the license.



For any future oil sands plants built by Greenfield utilizing the Greenfield License, Greenfield will pay Petroteq a 5% royalty of net revenues received from crude oil and other hydrocarbon products produced from oil sand resources.



In October 2021, Petroteq and Big Sky Resources LLC (“Big Sky”), a company based in Rye, New York, entered into a technology license agreement under which Petroteq granted to Big Sky a non-exclusive, non-transferable license and right to use Petroteq's proprietary ‎technology to design, construct, operate and finance oil sands extraction plants ‎at up to two locations in the continental United States. Under the agreement, ‎Big Sky has agreed to pay Petroteq a one-time, non-refundable license fee of ‎$2 million, which will become payable upon commencing construction of its first ‎plant. The agreement further provides that Big Sky will pay Petroteq a 5% royalty on the net revenue received by Big Sky from the ‎production, sale or other disposition of licensed product from the plants for as long as Petroteq continues to hold enforceable and protected intellectual ‎property rights in the licensed technology in the United States.‎



Pursuant to the licensing agreement, Big Sky is obligated to engage Valkor LLC (or an affiliate named by Valkor) as ‎the sole and exclusive provider of engineering, planning, and construction ‎services for all oil sands plants built by Big Sky or under its direction. Big Sky has indicated it will work closely with Valkor to identify ‎plant locations in the State of Utah. ‎



ASPHALT RIDGE PROCESSING PLANT 



In June 2011, Petroteq commenced the development of the Asphalt Ridge Plant at a site near Maeser, Utah and entered into construction and equipment fabrication contracts for the purpose of evaluating Petroteq’s Clean Oil Recovery Technology in extracting, processing and producing crude oil from oil sands mined from the TMC Mineral Lease and from other deposits located in the Asphalt Ridge area of Utah. By January 2014, our initial processing facility, designed as a pilot plant having processing capacity of 250 barrels per day, was fully permitted and construction was completed by October 1, 2014. Operations conducted at the pilot plant during 2015 allowed us to test and evaluate our proprietary technology at or near the Plant’s capacity. During 2015, the Plant produced approximately 10,000 (gross) barrels of oil from the local oil sands ores, including oil sands deposits located within our TMC Mineral Lease. From this production, 7,777.33 barrels of finished crude oil were sold to an oil and gas distributor for resale to its refinery customers, with the balance of the produced oil used internally to power generators for the Plant. The initial processing plant was flexible in that it had the ability to produce both high quality heavy crude oil as well as lighter oil if needed.



In 2015, with the sharp decline in world oil prices, we determined that the transportation costs incurred in hauling mined ore from our mine site to pilot processing facility, a distance of approximately 17 miles, were adversely affecting the economics of our processing operations. For that reason, we temporarily suspended operations in 2016, and, in 2017, the Plant was disassembled and moved from its original location to the site of our Temple Mountain mining site (referred to as Asphalt Ridge Mine #1) located within the TMC Mineral Lease. During the reassembly of the Plant, additional equipment was installed to increase the Plant’s capacity from 250 barrels per day to 400-500 barrels per day. In May 2018, mining operations at Asphalt Ridge Mine #1 recommenced, and the new upgraded Asphalt Ridge Plant commenced a test production phase of heavy crude oil from oil sands deposits at this site. Work to increase the Plant’s capacity to 400-500 barrels per day was completed during the last quarter of fiscal 2019 (the quarter ended August 31, 2019). Testing, which continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2020 (the quarter ended November 30, 2019), determined that a number of equipment upgrades were required to support continuous operation of the Plant.

Greenfield, a joint venture company established by TomCo and Valkor, assumed responsibility for the management and operations of our Asphalt Ridge Plant in July 2020. Greenfield has made certain upgrades to the Plant to improve its capacity and reliability. During the ensuing year, we anticipate that the Plant will be operated for the purpose of (a) extracting, processing and producing crude oil and other hydrocarbon products from oil sands ores supplied by our Asphalt Mine #1, from Greenfield and potentially from other sources and properties located in the Asphalt Ridge area, (b) evaluating and testing oil sands from varying sources that are impregnated with oils having different qualities and characteristics, and (c) demonstrating the capabilities of Petroteq’s Clean Oil Recovery Technology to potential investors and prospective licensees. Recent budgets for the Plant prepared by Valkor estimate that, during the ensuing year, the Plant will require approximately $3.8 million in capital expenditures and operating expenses and should be able to generate revenue in the range of $4 million.



RESOURCES AND MINING OPERATIONS



Through its acquisition of TMC Capital in June 2015, Petroteq indirectly acquired certain mineral rights under the TMC Mineral Lease, which encompassed approximately 1,229.82 acres of land in the Temple Mountain area of Asphalt Ridge in Uintah County, Utah. In June 2018, Petroteq, acting through POSR, acquired the record lease title and all of the operating rights to produce oil from oil sands resources under two mineral leases entitled “Utah State Mineral Lease for Bituminous-Asphaltic Sands”, each dated June 1, 2018, between the State of Utah’s School and Institutional Trust Land Administration (“SITLA”), as lessor, and POSR, as lessee, covering lands consisting of approximately 1,351.91 acres that largely adjoin the lands covered by the TMC Mineral Lease (“the Temple Mountain SITLA Leases”). In March 2019, a third SITLA Lease was acquired by Petroteq that added 39.97 acres to the mix in the Temple Mountain area of Asphalt Ridge.



In April 2019 and in July 2019, in two separate transactions, TMC Capital acquired an initial 50% and then the remaining 50% of the oil sands operating rights under five (5) federal (U.S.) oil and gas leases administered by the (U.S.) Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), covering lands located in eastern and south-eastern Utah (“BLM Leases”). The BLM Leases have been included in applications, filed decades ago with the BLM under the (U.S.) Combined Hydrocarbon Lease Act of 1981, for conversion to new “Combined Hydrocarbon Leases” that will eventually allow the development of oil sands resources in the federal lands included within the BLM Leases and in surrounding areas,



As described in more detail below, the TMC Mineral Lease in its original form was terminated effective August 10, 2020, and a new Short-Term Mining Lease, dated the same date, was entered into between Asphalt Ridge, Inc., as lessor, and Valkor, as lessee. Valkor and TMC Capital thereafter entered into a Short-Term Mining and Mineral Sublease dated August 20, 2020 (the “TMC Mineral Sublease”) in which all of Valkor’s rights and interests under the Short-Term Mining Lease were subleased to TMC Capital. As of August 31, 2021, Petroteq (through its subsidiaries) held mineral leases (or the operating rights under leases) covering approximately 7,631.91 net acres within the State of Utah, consisting of approximately 320 acres held under the TMC Mineral Sublease, 1,351.91 acres held under the Temple Mountain SITLA Leases, and 5,960 acres under the BLM Leases.



Between March 14, 2019 and May 31, 2020, we made cash deposits of $1,907,000, included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets for the acquisition of 100% of the operating rights under U.S. federal oil and gas leases, administered by the BLM in Garfield and Wayne Counties, covering approximately 8,480 gross acres in P.R. Springs and the Tar Sands Triangle within the State of Utah. The total consideration of $3,000,000 has been partially settled by the $1,907,000 cash deposit, with the balance of $1,093,000 still outstanding.

In a letter agreement dated April 17, 2020 between the transferor of the oil and gas leases and TMC Capital, as transferee, the parties, due to uncertainty as to whether all of the 10 leases for which the Company had initially paid deposits would be considered active by BLM and included in new Combined Hydrocarbon Leases (CHLs) under the Combined Hydrocarbon Act of 1981 - agreed to adjust the purchase price as follows: (a) should all 10 of the leases be available and included in CHL’s, the Company will pay the additional $1,093,000 for the rights under the leases; (b) if only a portion of the leases ranging from 4 to 9 of the leases are available and included in CHL’s, the final purchase price of the leases will be between $1.5 million and $2.5 million; and (c) notwithstanding the above, if after a period of 7 years from April 17, 2020, at least six of the leases are not determined to be active and are not included in CHLs the Company shall be entitled to demand a refund of $1.2 million or instruct the Seller to acquire other leases in the same area for up to $1.2 million.



The following table sets forth the gross/net developed and undeveloped acreage held under the TMC Mineral Sub-Lease.

The TMC Mineral Sublease covers lands situated in or near Utah’s Asphalt Ridge, an area located along the northern edge of the Uintah Basin and containing oil sands deposits located at or near the surface. Most of the oil-impregnated reservoirs or deposits in the Asphalt Ridge area are found in the Rimrock Sandstone (Mesaverde Group Formations) and in the (Tertiary) Duchense River Formation. Substantial bitumen deposits in the Rimrock and Duchense River Formations extend from the northwest in a southeasterly direction through the lands included in the TMC Mineral Sublease, including the lands included in T5S-R22E (Section 31) where our Asphalt Ridge Mine #1 is located. Bitumen and heavy oil saturated pay thicknesses in lands covered by the TMC Mineral Sublease generally range from 50-200 feet or more, with oil content or saturation averaging approximately 6% by weight.



As announced by Petroteq on October 29, 2020, a recent survey of Petroteq's lease properties has identified three key areas where the oil sands ore appears to have higher oil saturations than what was previously mined. Samples were taken from each location and lab assays of the samples showed that the ore was a higher quality to that mined previously. These areas are currently anticipated to be the focus of Petroteq's mining efforts during the initial operation of the Asphalt Ridge Plant following its restart. In addition, six corehole locations were staked and, subject to rig availability, will be drilled during January. This work is expected to allow Petroteq's mining consultant to develop a detailed mining plan which would direct future mining operations for extended plant operation. No additional exploratory work has been performed in the preceding three years.

TMC Mineral Sublease 



The TMC Mineral Lease originally issued to TMC Capital in July 2013 has been terminated and replaced with (a) a new Short-Term Mining Lease dated as of August 10, 2020 between Asphalt Ridge, Inc., as lessor, and Valkor, as lessee, and (b) a TMC Mineral Sublease in which all of the rights and interests of Valkor under the Short-Term Mining Lease were subleased to TMC Capital. Under the TMC Mineral Lease, TMC Capital was granted the exclusive right to explore for, mine and produce oil and other minerals associated with oil sands, subject to certain depth limits. The lands covered by and included within the TMC Mineral Sublease include both our Asphalt Mine #1 and the Asphalt Ridge Plant owned by POSR



Previously, TMC Capital was the direct lessee under the TMC Mineral Lease, which was amended on October 1, 2015, March 1, 2016, February 1, 2018, and most recently on November 21, 2018. The primary term of the TMC Mineral Lease originally commenced July 1, 2013 and continued for approximately seven years until August 20, 2020,





7







The TMC Mineral Sublease has a term that is co-extensive with the term of the Short-Term Mining Lease between Asphalt Ridge, Inc. and Valkor, and originally included an expiration date of June 30, 2021. On July 1, 2021 Asphalt Ridge, Inc. and Valkor amended the Short-Term Mining Lease to extend the term of the lease until December 31, 2021, which in turn extended the term of the TMC Mineral Sublease to December 31, 2021 as well. We anticipate that additional extensions will be agreed upon by December 31, 2021 that will extend the term of the Short Term Mining Lease and the TMC Mineral Sublease as may be required to continue operations under the lease and at the Asphalt Ridge Plant during the ensuing year. 



Upon entering into the TMC Mineral Sublease, TMC Capital paid Valkor an initial rental fee in the amount of $25,000 and is required to pay Valkor a monthly rental fee of $15,000 during the term of the TMC Mineral Sublease. TMC Capital is also obligated to pay production royalties consisting of (a) eight percent (8%) of the gross revenue received from the sale or disposition of bitumen or from oil and other minerals derived from processing bitumen extracted from oil sands deposits within the lands covered by the Sublease.



During the year ending August 31, 2020, we received (gross) proceeds of $290,809 from the sale of upgraded or finished oil produced at the Asphalt Ridge Plant from oil sands mined under the TMC Mineral Lease. During our fiscal years ending August 31, 2019 we had sales of $59,335 and for the years ended August 31, 2018 and 2017 and 2016, we had no sales of produced oil since, during this period, we temporarily suspended our mining and processing operations during the relocation, reassembly and expansion of the Plant to a new site located within the TMC Mineral Lease.



During the last five (5) months of 2015, we produced approximately 10,000 barrels of oil, with 2,222 barrels consumed as fuel in plant operations and 7,777.33 barrels sold and delivered to an independent purchaser at the Plant. Our use of produced oil as a fuel source for plant generators in 2015 is no longer necessary since the Plant’s power supply is now provided by a local power company. 



The costs associated with extraction and processing operations at the Asphalt Ridge Plant that are used in determining our “Average Production Costs” include the costs of oil sands ore, natural gas liquids, aromatic solvent, operator labor, electricity, propane, nitrogen, water, diesel fuel and rental equipment. The primary costs are the costs of mining oil sands ore, natural gas liquids, aromatic solvents, and labor costs. Other than the aromatic solvents, the condensate used as both a solvent and a feedstock in the processing operations at Plant is produced by processing natural gas liquids through a distillation column, with aromatic solvents then added to the distillate. In addition:




● | Our fixed costs generally remain constant without regard to the API gravity of our upgraded crude oil;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our oil sands ore costs, which include our mining costs, the cost of transporting mined ore to our processing facility, and pre-processing costs (crushing etc.) incurred in preparing mined ore for processing, do not vary with the API gravity of the oil produced at our facility, but will decrease over time (subject to economies of scale) as our mining operations expand and oil production increases; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Solvent and condensate costs are based on the market prices that exist for each category of product, which are usually determined by a monthly average of prevailing prices in effect during the month of delivery. Solvent and condensate costs typically increase as the target API gravity for our finished crude oil increases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




During the period of August 2018 through December 2018, our “Average Production Costs” at the Asphalt Ridge Plant decreased to $27 per barrel of oil produced at the facility. During this period, our fixed costs did not differ materially from our August 2015 to December 2015 fixed costs. We do anticipate that any increase in production or throughput capacity at the Plant will result in any reduction of the fixed costs per barrel at the facility.



With respect to variable costs at the Asphalt Ridge Plant, our oil sands ore cost during the 2018 period increased to an average of $6.65 per barrel, due primarily to the quantity and quality of ore processed, but with cost-savings resulting from the relocation of the Plant to the site of our Asphalt Ridge Mine #1 located within the TMC Mineral Lease. In addition, during the 2018 period, our average cost of aromatic solvent decreased to $0.47 per gallon and the average cost of condensate was substantially lower at $2.75 per barrel, due primarily to our production of heavier oil with an API gravity of between 15 and 25 degrees.





8







The API gravity for the raw heavy oil or bitumen extracted from oil sands ores initially processed at the Asphalt Ridge Plant has averaged approximately 10 degrees. Through the application of our Crude Oil Recovery Technology at the Plant, we are able to produce a crude oil having a range of API gravity of between 10 degrees and 12 degrees. Through our solvent formulation and the select distillation capabilities, we are able to craft final crude oil products that can meet the specifications of a range of customers.



Generally, we have been able to sell the finished oil produced at our Asphalt Ridge Plant at a price representing a discount off an average of published prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil for a specified period.  WTI crude oil is commonly used as a benchmark in pricing oil under oil sales/purchase contracts, particularly in the United States. The discount off the WTI benchmark price is based on a number of factors, including differences that may exist between the specifications of our crude oil and those of WTI crude oil together with the cost of transporting our crude oil to delivery points. Since WTI crude oil generally has an API gravity of between 37-42 degrees, a heavier oil having a lower API gravity in the range of the oil produced at our processing facility will be valued and sold at a price reflecting a discount off the WTI benchmark price. More recently, however, we have been able to sell finished oil produced at the Plant at a price that is closer to or at the WTI benchmark price, suggesting that we are increasingly able to market our produced oils at a premium due to refiner demands for domestic heavy sweet crude oil.



Acquisition of the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases



Recently, TMC Capital and POSR, Petroteq’s operating subsidiaries, and Valkor entered into an “Agreement Governing Reciprocal Assignment of Mineral Leases” dated October 15, 2021 (the “Exchange Agreement”), under which (a) TMC Capital/POSR agreed to assign to Valkor all of their respective rights and interests in the TMC Mineral Lease, the Short-Term Mining Lease, and the Temple Mountain SITLA Leases, and (b) Valkor agreed to assign to TMC Capital all of its rights and interests in the following Utah state mineral leases located in the Asphalt Ridge Northwest area of Uintah County, Utah (the “Asphalt Ridge NW Leases”):



(a) Utah State Mineral Lease for Bituminous-Asphaltic Sands dated as of September 1, 2018 (Mineral Lease No. 53831), executed between the State of Utah, acting by and through the School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (“SITLA”), as lessor, and Indago Oil and Gas, Inc., as lessee, covering approximately 640 acres;



(b) Utah State Mineral Lease for Bituminous-Asphaltic Sands dated as of September 1, 2018 (Mineral Lease No. 53832), executed between the State of Utah, acting by and through SITLA, as lessor, and Indago Oil and Gas, Inc., as lessee, covering approximately 898.22 acres; and



(c) Utah State Mineral Lease for Bituminous-Asphaltic Sands dated as of June 1, 2018 (Mineral Lease No. 53805), executed between the State of Utah, acting by and through SITLA, as lessor, and Indago Oil and Gas, Inc., as lessee, covering approximately 1,920 acres.



The Asphalt Ridge NW Leases cover or encompass approximately 3,458.22 acres, lands that are located in an area referred to as “Asphalt Ridge Northwest” and in close proximity to mineral leases held by Greenfield. Valkor acquired the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases under an Assignment of Oil and Gas Leases dated June 29, 2021 executed between Indago Oil and Gas Inc., as assignor, and Valkor Energy Holdings, LLC, as assignee, which was approved by SITLA on or about September 10, 2021.



Under the terms of the Exchange Agreement, Valkor has executed an assignment to TMC Capital of the record lease title and all of the operating rights (working interests) under the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases, and TMC Capital has in turn executed assignments transferring to Valkor all of TMC’s rights and interests in the Asphalt Ridge and SITLA Leases located in the Temple Mountain area. However, the reciprocal assignment of the SITLA Leases under the Exchange Agreement, including the assignment of the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases to TMC Capital, will not constitute final and completed transactions until the assignments have been reviewed and approved by SITLA.





9







Following the execution of the Exchange Agreement in October 2021, TMC Capital and Valkor also entered into the following agreements:



(1) Under an Agreement Governing Assignment of Participation Rights in Mineral Leases, Valkor granted to TMC Capital the right to participate at up to a 50% interest in any future exploration or production operations conducted by Valkor under the Short-Term Mining Lease.



(2) Under an Agreement Governing Assignment of Operating Rights (SITLA Leases), TMC Capital assigned to Valkor all of the operating rights under the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases at depths of 500 feet or more below the surface, with TMC Capital reserving the right to participate at up to a 50% working interest in any exploratory or production operation conducted by Valkor at the deeper intervals. The assignment of the deeper operating rights to Valkor, subject to TMC Capital’s participation rights, is also subject to approval by SITLA.



The Exchange Agreement and the reciprocal assignment of mineral leases between and among TMC, POSR and Valkor will not affect the ownership of the Asphalt Ridge Plant, which will continue to be owned by Petroteq through POSR.



The recent transactions under the Exchange Agreement, including Valkor’s assignment of lease record title and operating rights to TMC Capital in the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases, will expand Petroteq’s oil sands resources in Utah and provide Petroteq with the following additional advantages and benefits:




● | Based on data obtained to date, we estimate that the oil content or saturation rate for the oil sands deposits existing within the lands covered by the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases at approximately 12% by weight. In contract, the oil saturation rate in the oil sands resources under the TMC Mineral Lease and the Short-Term Mining Lease in the Temple Mountain area of Asphalt Ridge has an average oil content or saturation rate of approximately 6% by weight. The difference in oil content or saturation in the oil sands deposits contained within the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases is substantial and should significantly improve the economics of our mining and processing operations as we go forward;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Asphalt Ridge NW Leases contain an oil sands deposit that is contiguous within a single contained area, which will allow for greater efficiencies in our mining and transport operations. In contrast, the oil deposits contained within the original TMC Mineral Lease are contained in separate blocks running along a trend of approximately eight miles and the Temple Mountain SITLA Leases are completely undeveloped with limited exploration;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Asphalt Ridge NW Leases contain substantial oil sands resources in outcroppings located near the surface (with less overburden), creating new and better surface mining prospects for Petroteq and its operating subsidiaries.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Asphalt Ridge NW (SITLA) Leases



The Asphalt Ridge NW Leases acquired by TMC Capital under the Exchange Agreement are Utah state bituminous mineral leases having a primary term of ten (10) years and an extended term thereafter for as long as (a) oil and hydrocarbon products extracted from oil sands are produced in paying quantities, or (b) the mineral lessee is otherwise engaged in diligent operations, exploration or development activity and certain other conditions are satisfied. Generally, the term of the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases may not be extended beyond the twentieth year of their effective dates except by production in paying quantities. An annual minimum royalty or rental of $10 an acre must be paid during the first ten years of the leases; from and after the 11th year of the leases, the annual minimum royalty may be adjusted by the lessor based on certain “readjustment” provisions in the leases.



During the development of the Exchange Agreement that resulted in Valkor’s transfer of the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases to TMC Capital, Petroteq obtained a preliminary resource evaluation report from an independent engineering firm estimating approximately 85-90 million barrels of oil in place within the oil sands deposits located within the leases.





10







The BLM Leases



In April 2019, TMC acquired an undivided 50% of the operating rights under the BLM Leases, consisting of the right to explore for and produce oil from oil sands formations and deposits from the surface down to a subsurface depth of 1,000 feet. The operating rights assigned and transferred to TMC under certain of the BLM Leases also grant to TMC the right, subject to similar depth limitation, to explore for and produce oil and gas from conventional sources. Each of the BLM Leases includes lands that are located within a “Special Tar Sands Area” or “STSA”, a geographic area that has been designated by the (U.S.) Department of Interior as containing substantial deposits of oil sands.



The BLM Leases were originally issued by BLM under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (the “MLA”). However, because the definition of “oil” in the MLA prior to 1981 did not include oil produced from oil sands, the BLM Leases (and all other federal onshore mineral leases issued prior to 1981) did not authorize the development and recovery of oil from oil sands, tar sands and bitumen-impregnated rocks and sediments. The Combined Hydrocarbon Leasing Act of 1981 (“CHL Act”) expanded the definition of “oil” to include oil produced from oil sands and bitumen deposits and authorized the issuance of new “combined hydrocarbon leases” or “CHLs” that permit exploration and production of oil and gas from both conventional sources and from oil sands deposits.



For federal onshore mineral leases that were in effect on November 16, 1981 (the CHL Act’s enactment date) and included lands located within an STSA, the CHL Act granted to lessees the right to convert such leases to new CHLs. Upon issuance by BLM, each CHL will constitute a new lease that will remain in effect for a primary term of ten (10) years and thereafter for as long as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.



Each of the BLM Leases has been included in an application to BLM requesting their conversion to new CHLs. During the pendency of such applications, the term (and any operations) of the BLM Leases are in “suspension status” under BLM regulations until the new CHLs are issued.



SUMMARY OF PRODUCTION ROYALTIES 



Technology Transfer Agreement



Pursuant to the terms of a technology transfer agreement dated November 7, 2011 that we entered into with Vladimir Podlipsky, the developer of Petroteq’s Clean Oil Recovery Technology, we are obligated to pay Mr. Podlipsky a royalty on production from each processing plant that we own or operate that uses the technology, starting with the construction and operation of a second plant. The royalty, if and at such time as it becomes payable, will consist of 2% of gross sales if the price of heavy oil is below $60 per barrel; 3% of gross sales if the price of heavy oil is between $60 and $69.99 per barrel; 3.5% of gross sales if the price of heavy oil is between $70 and $79.99; and 4% of gross sales if the price of heavy oil is greater than $80 per barrel.
TMC Mineral Lease



Under the TMC Mineral Lease, TMC Capital held 100% of the working interests (subject to a 1.6 % overriding royalty previously granted to Temple Mountain Energy, Inc.), with production royalties under a sliding scale starting at 8% of the gross proceeds derived from the sale or disposition of oil (including bitumen) and other hydrocarbon products produced from oil deposits within the lease.



In addition, TMC was required to make certain advance royalty payments to the lessor. During the period from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2020, the minimum payments were $100,000 per quarter. The minimum payments were to increase to $150,000 per quarter beginning July 1, 2020. The TMC Mineral Lease was terminated in August 2020 and replaced with the Short-Term Mining Lease issued to Valkor and the TMC Mineral Sublease between Valkor and TMC Capital.



Production royalties payable under the TMC Mineral Sublease are 8% of the gross sales revenue, subject to certain adjustments.



Asphalt Ridge NW (SITLA) Leases



Under the terms of the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases, TMC Capital will be required to pay: (i) an annual rent equal to the greater of $1 an acre or a fixed sum of $500 (without regard to acreage); and (ii) a production royalty of 8% of the market price received for oil and hydrocarbon products produced from the leases at the point of first sale, less reasonable actual costs of transportation to the point of first sale. After the tenth year of the leases, SITLA (the lessor) may increase the royalty rate by as much as one percent (1%) per year up to a maximum of 12.5%, subject to a proviso that production royalties under the leases shall never be less than $3.00/bbl during the term of the leases.





11







BLM Leases



Under the BLM Leases, production royalties are governed by BLM regulations and are payable to the U.S. Department of Interior at the rate of 12.5% of the amount or value of the production removed and sold. The interests acquired by TMC under the BLM Leases are also subject to a 6.25% overriding royalty reserved by predecessors-in-title.



PERMITS AND TAXES



On September 15, 2008, a large mining permit was granted to TME Asphalt Ridge, LLC by the State of Utah Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining (“UDOGM”) for the mining and development of the Asphalt Ridge Mine #1, an open pit mine located on lands included within the TMC Mineral Lease.



On or about July 9, 2015, UDOGM approved an application filed by TMC Capital to transfer the “Notice of Intention to Commence Large Mining Operations” for the Asphalt Ridge Mine #1 (Permit # M/047/0089) from TME Asphalt Ridge LLC to TMC Capital. On October 27, 2017, UDOGM granted final approval to TMC Capital’s “Amended Notice of Intention to Commence Large Mining Operations” and issued final Permit # M/047/0089 authorizing TMC Capital to conduct operations at Asphalt Ridge Mine #1.



Mining operations, including the initial development of the mine at the property and removal of a portion of the overburden soil layer, have already been performed. In addition to the mining permits, all environmental, construction, utility and other local permits necessary for the construction of the Asphalt Ridge Plant and processing oil sands ores and sediments have been granted to Petroteq’s operating subsidiaries.



Specifically, a Groundwater Discharge Permit was issued by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality (Division of Water Quality, Water Quality Board) (“UDEQ”), on July 26, 2016 (expiration on July 27, 2021), covering disposal of tailings from ore sands produced from the land area encompassed by the Asphalt Ridge Mine #1. This permit, required by Utah law even though our processing facility does not use a water-based process, authorizes a return of residual sand tailings to the mine for backfill and capping. A Small Source Registration air permit was issued by UDEQ by a letter dated November 2, 2018. The letter confirms that the Asphalt Ridge Plant is exempt from any requirement of additional air quality permits since the facility produces less emissions than the level that would require a special air permit. A Conditional Use Permit (“CUP”) was issued by the Uintah County (Utah) Commission to us on January 29, 2018, for the operation of the Plant. The CUP is a right/interest in land under Utah law and will continue in effect in perpetuity.



The oil and gas properties (including plants, equipment etc.) included in our private mineral leases are subject to the State of Utah’s property (ad valorem) tax. The actual tax rate is established by each county in the State (and therefore may vary) and is generally assessed against the “fair market value” of the property. Under Utah Code § 59-2-1103, the oil and gas properties included in the SITLA Leases are exempt from the State’s property (ad valorem) tax (although this exemption does not apply to improvements on state lands).



Under Utah Code § 59-5-120, beginning January 1, 2006 and ending June 30, 2026, no severance (production) tax will be imposed on oil and gas produced from oil sands (tar sands). Accordingly, severance tax will not be owed to the State of Utah on the production of oil and hydrocarbon substances from the TMC Mineral Sublease or our SITLA Leases until after June 30, 2026.



PETROTEQ’S PROPRIETARY EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY



Petroteq intends to continue to develop its business and operations by (a) producing and marketing crude oil and hydrocarbon products (and sand byproduct) from oil sands resources under its mineral leases, or that may be acquired from third parties, through the use of Petroteq’s Clean Oil Recovery Technology, and (b) marketing its proprietary technology through licenses and other co-venture arrangements with third parties. The centerpiece of our proprietary technology consists of a patented closed loop, continuous flow, scalable and environmentally safe extraction technology and involves a process that can extract crude oil (primarily bitumen and heavy oil) and other hydrocarbon products from a wide range of oil sands deposits and other hydrocarbon sediment types. Petroteq’s oil extraction process takes place in a completely closed loop system that continuously recirculates and recycles the solvent after it has separated the bitumen and heavy oils from the oil sands. The closed loop system is capable of recovering up to 99% of all hydrocarbons from the oil sands. The only two end products that are produced through our proprietary extraction are high quality heavy oil and clean sand, making this technology environmentally benign.





12







Petroteq’s Clean Oil Recovery Technology, which has been modified since 2015, utilizes no water in the process, is anticipated to produce minimal greenhouse gases, and is expected to extract up to 99% of all hydrocarbon content and recycle up to 95% of the solvents. The proprietary solvent composition used in the process is expected to dissolve up to 99% of heavy bitumen/asphalt and other lighter hydrocarbons from the oil sands and prevent their precipitation during the extraction process. Solvents used in this composition form an azeotropic mixture which has a low boiling point of 50 – 65 °C (degrees Celsius) and it is expected to allow recycling of over 95% of the solvent.



In the oil extraction and upgrade process utilized at the Asphalt Ridge Plant, the bitumen crude oil that is extracted from mined oil sands has an average API gravity of 9-12 degrees.



No diluents or blending agents are used to reduce the viscosity of the heavy oil extracted from bitumen saturated ores. Instead, varying amounts of solvent are introduced into an extraction tank containing raw oil sands ore that has been crushed prior to being added to the extraction tank. The solvent is designed to release the crude oil from bitumen-saturated ore during the initial extraction process.



The crude oil containing solvent is then introduced or subjected to a simple flash distillation process where virtually all of the solvent is recovered and recycled for future use.



Our oil extraction process, developed and used in the Asphalt Ridge Plant during its pilot phase, has a Feed/Bottoms heat exchanger, a Solvent Vaporizer (heat exchanger), a Solvent Scrubber (vessel), air-cooled condensers, an air-cooled product cooler, a Bitumen Product Pump, and an oil heater plus a propane tank as the energy source. The bitumen/solvent slurry is routed via a pump to the Feed/Bottoms Exchanger where it is pre-heated both to cool the exiting product as well as to integrate the heat available from the flash distillation process. This pre-heated slurry is then heated in the Solvent Vaporizer to approximately 405°F to vaporize essentially all of the solvent from the bitumen product. This two-phase stream is then flashed across a control valve and routed to the Solvent Scrubber where the gaseous solvent stream exits the vessel and is routed to air-cooled condensers where it will be liquified and returned to the storage vessel to be re-used. The resultant hot bitumen is pumped through the Feed/Bottoms exchanger via the Bitumen Product Pump and cooled prior to entering an air-cooled exchanger where it is cooled to 180°F, the temperature at which the product is stored. If it is desired that solvent be left in the bitumen for transportation purposes, the temperature of that back end flash distillation process can be controlled.



Petroteq has received patents in the United States, Canada and Russia that protect the claims and processes embodied in its Clean Oil Recovery Technology. See “Intellectual Property” below.



INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY



On March 27, 2013, Petroteq entered into an intellectual property license agreement in a private arm’s length transaction with TS Energy Ltd, a Canadian company, which has agreed to act as the sole and exclusive licensee of our Clean Oil Recovery Technology within Canada and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.



On July 2, 2019, Petroteq entered into an intellectual property license agreement with Valkor LLC, a company based in Katy, Texas, for the non-exclusive, non-transferable use of Petroteq’s Clean Oil Recovery Technology on a worldwide basis (subject to any exclusive license agreements in effect) in the engineering, construction and operation of oil sands plants. The agreement requires Valkor to invest (or secure investment of) a minimum of $20 million towards the construction of an oil sands plant by December 2020, and to have in production a minimum of 1,000 barrels per day. The agreement also requires Valkor to pay a one-time non-refundable license fee of $2 million per oil sands plant commissioned, with 50% payable upon start of construction and the remainder payable upon first production. The agreement further provides that Valkor will pay a five percent (5%) royalty based on annual gross sales for so long as the licensed technology is covered by a valid claim in the country in which it is used.

THE OIL SANDS MARKET



As an unconventional hydrocarbon resource, oil sands hold hundreds of billions of barrels of oil on a worldwide basis. Although Canada is the only country that is currently extracting large quantities of oil from its oil sands deposits, the United States also has large oil sands resources that can be developed. In a 2007 Report entitled “A Technical, Economic, and Legal Assessment of North American Oil Shale, Oil Sands, and Heavy Oil Resources In Response to Energy Policy Act of 2005 Section 369(p)” (September 2007), prepared by the Utah Heavy Oil Program, Institute For Clean and Secure Energy and The University of Utah for the U.S. Department of Energy (the “2007 Report”), the authors reported the following estimates, which estimates were based upon source material published in 1979, 1987 and 1993:

● | The United States has an estimated 76 billion barrels of oil-in-place (“OIP”) (OIP are not estimates of reserves or recoverable resources) from bitumen and heavy oil contained in oil sands resources;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the United States, Utah is known to have the largest oil sands deposits, with total resource estimates ranging from 23 to 32 billion barrels of OIP from bitumen and heavy oil contained in oil sands formations and deposits; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Within the state of Utah, the region that has experienced the most oil sands development, both in terms of existing oil production and supporting infrastructure, is the Asphalt Ridge area located on the northern edge of the Uintah Basin in eastern Utah. In the 2007 Report, it is estimated that about one (1) billion barrels of OIP exist in the form of bitumen and heavy oil contained in oil sands formations and deposits in the Asphalt Ridge area.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From our own investigation of the oil sands deposits in the Asphalt Ridge area of Utah, we believe that a substantial part of the oil sands deposits in this area are accessible through outcroppings or in shallow depths with limited or no overburden. In our view, the location and accessibility of oil sands deposits in Asphalt Ridge create an opportunity for commercial development, supported by positive economics, using surface mining techniques and our extraction technology.



The worldwide growing demand for heavy crude oil and the recent decline in heavy crude oil production in countries such as Venezuela makes the high quality, low Sulphur, heavy oil found in oil sands deposits in the United States a valuable resource that has been underdeveloped to date. The development of “tight shale” oil plays in the United States has produced significant quantities of light, sweet crude oil reserves, but heavy oil development in the United States has lagged. To date, oil sands development has been limited by the absence of a viable technology that can extract heavy oil and bitumen from the oil sands deposits in an economical and environmentally responsible manner. To that end, Petroteq has developed and patented an extraction technology that aims to develop oil sands reserves in an economical and environmentally responsible manner. Petroteq is currently expanding its commercial oil sands extraction operations in the Asphalt Ridge area, utilizing a process that is economical, environmentally benign and produces high quality heavy oil.



We have tested our Clean Oil Recovery Technology from oil sands sourced from both the Asphalt Ridge area of Utah and from different parts of the world that have different hydrocarbon chemical compositions. To date, we have conducted tests with oil sands from Russia, China, Indonesia and the Middle East. Our tests with Russian oil sands, which were the only tests of our Extraction Technology with oil sands from different parts of the world that were conducted by third parties, were conducted in Ufa, Bashkorkostan (Russia) by a third party (KVADRA) retained by us to perform the tests using a multi-ton pilot plant, used the local oil sands ore with oil saturation in a range of 7-10%, and resulted in industrial quantities of heavy oil. From the tests conducted in Ufa, an average of 70 metric tons of raw oil sands material were processed per day resulting in 5,475 kg of heavy asphaltenic oil per day. Other tests, consisting of oil sands samples from China, Indonesia and Jordan, were conducted internally at Petroteq’s laboratory in San Diego using lab bench testing with our own solvent blend that produced approximately one to two pound quantities. By introducing the solvent mixture to crushed and treated ore containing bitumen oil, the oil was separated by recycling the solvent with a laboratory-scale rotor vacuum evaporator. Sand tailings were separated by centrifuge and dried under the vacuum.



Through our testing of oil sands sourced from different countries, we found that the efficiency and consistency of Petroteq’s extraction technology are not affected by differences in the chemical composition of the oil/bitumen in the oil sands. Despite relatively significant differences in oil/bitumen chemistry, both the efficiency and consistency of our extraction technology remained intact, resulting in an oil recovery efficiency that in each test exceeded 99%. We believe that this testing demonstrates that the Extraction Process is universal in its application and does not depend on the material source or the hydrocarbon content or fingerprint.



REGULATION



Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. This regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells, maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandoning of wells. Full mining permits have been granted to POR from the State of Utah Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining for the mining and development of the Asphalt Ridge Mine #1 located in the Asphalt Ridge area of Utah. In addition to the mining permits, all environmental, construction, utility and other local permits necessary for the construction of the plant and the processing of the oil sands have been granted to POR. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations.



Typically, oil enhancements such as hydraulic fracturing operations are overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs; however, the (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where EPA is the permitting authority. As a result, we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for our operations. These permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive. In addition, legislation introduced in Congress provides for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and requires the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids. Moreover, on November 23, 2011, the EPA announced that it was granting in part a petition to initiate a rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production. Further, on May 4, 2012, the BLM issued a proposed rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and Indian land.

On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulphur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities. Among other things, these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. In addition, gas wells are required to use completion combustion device equipment (e.g., flaring) by October 15, 2012 if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line. Further, the final rules under NESHAP include maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for “small” glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves. Compliance with these requirements, especially the imposition of these green completion requirements, may require modifications to certain of our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.



In addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals, some states such as Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Texas, Kansas, Louisiana and Montana, and certain local governments have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, including requirements regarding chemical disclosure, casing and cementing of wells, withdrawal of water for use in high-volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, baseline testing of nearby water wells, and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas adopted rules in December 2011 requiring disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition, Pennsylvania’s Act 13 of 2012 became law on February 14, 2012 and amended the state’s Oil and Gas Act to impose an impact fee for drilling, increase setbacks from certain water sources, require water management plans, increase civil penalties, strengthen the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection’s (PaDEP) authority over the issuance of drilling permits, and require the disclosure of chemical information regarding the components in hydraulic fracturing fluids.



We believe that the technologies we use are cleaner and environmentally friendlier than the known fracking or tar sand technologies. Regulatory and social resistance sometimes prohibits fracking recovery methods in some states.



OSHA and Other Laws and Regulations.



We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), and comparable state laws. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state laws require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. Also, pursuant to OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety.



Oil Pollution Act.



The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the United States. The term “waters of the United States” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies, including wetlands and intermittent streams. The OPA assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. We believe that we are in compliance with the OPA and the federal regulations promulgated thereunder in the conduct of our operations.
Clean Water Act.



The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) and resulting regulations, which are primarily implemented through a system of permits, also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the United States. Sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the Clean Water Act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. However, regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges. We believe that we substantially comply with the Clean Water Act and related federal and state regulations.

COMPETITION



Competition in the oil industry is intense. We compete with other companies seeking to acquire sub economic oil fields, many with substantial financial and other resources. We will also compete with technologies such as gas injection, polymer flooding, microbial injection and thermal methods. As a new technology, we also compete with many of the other technologies that have been proven to be economically successful in enhancing oil production in the United States. As a result of this competition, we may be unable to attract the necessary funding or qualified personnel. If we are unable to successfully compete for funding or for qualified personnel, our activities may be slowed, suspended or terminated, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations. However due to the innovative nature of our technology and the ecological benefit it provides, while remaining economically efficient, we believe that competition will not be a significant impediment to our operations or expansion.
IMPLICATIONS OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and therefore we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements, including not being required to have our internal controls over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) even if we cease to be a smaller reporting company with annual revenues of less than $100 million, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.



We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year: (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common shares pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act; (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion; or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which generally means the market value of our common shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with that term in the JOBS Act.



ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES



We are a company incorporated in Ontario, Canada. Certain of our directors and officers named in this registration statement reside outside the U.S. In addition, some of our assets and the assets of our directors and officers are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors who reside in the United States to effect service of process upon these persons in the United States. You may also have difficulty enforcing, both in and outside the United States, judgments you may obtain in U.S. courts against us or these persons in any action, including actions based upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws.



Furthermore, there is substantial doubt whether an action could be brought in Canada in the first instance predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Canadian courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of U.S. securities laws against us or these persons on the grounds that Canada is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim. Even if a Canadian court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Canadian law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Canadian law.

History and Development of the Company



We were incorporated as “AXEA Capital Corp.” on January 4, 2008 pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). On October 15, 2012, MCW Energy Group Limited (“MCW NB”), a corporation incorporated in the Province of New Brunswick, completed a reverse acquisition of AXEA Capital Corp. (the “RTO”) and as a result MCW NB became a wholly owned subsidiary of AXEA Capital Corp. which also changed its name from “AXEA Capital Corp.” to “MCW Enterprises Ltd.” Pursuant to articles of continuance filed on December 7, 2012, MCW NB changed its jurisdiction of governance by continuing from the Province of New Brunswick into the Province of Ontario. Pursuant to articles of continuance filed on December 12, 2012, MCW Enterprises Ltd. changed its jurisdiction of governance by continuing from the Province of British Columbia into the Province of Ontario and changed its name to MCW Enterprises Continuance Ltd. Pursuant to a certificate of amalgamation dated December 12, 2012, MCW Enterprises Continuance Ltd. and MCW NB amalgamated in the Province of Ontario and continued under the name “MCW Energy Group Limited”.



We are governed by the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) and our registered office is located at Suite 6000, 1 First Canadian Place, PO Box 367, 100 King Street West, Toronto, Ontario M5X 1E2, Canada. Our executive office is located at 15315 W. Magnolia Blvd., Suite 120, Sherman Oaks, California 91403. Our telephone number is (866) 571-9613.



Our common shares are listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSXV”) under the trading symbol “PQE” but currently suspended from trading, the Frankfurt Exchange under the trading symbol PQCF.F and on the OTC Pink under the trading symbol “PQEFF”.



Pursuant to articles of amendment filed on May 5, 2017, we changed our name from “MCW Energy Group Limited” to “Petroteq Energy Inc.” and we changed our TSXV trading symbol from MCW to PQE.

Since March 15, 2018, our stock has traded on the OTC Pink market when it no longer traded on the OTCQX International Market.



On May 5, 2017, we effected a share consolidation (reverse stock split) on a 1-for-30 basis. Unless otherwise included, all shares amounts and per share amounts in this registration statement have been prepared on a pro forma basis to reflect the 1-for-30 reverse stock split of our outstanding common shares. On November 23, 2018, our shareholders approved a resolution authorizing our Board of Directors to consolidate our shares on a basis of up to ten for one. No consolidation has been effected to date.



We determined that the Company ceased to qualify as a foreign private issuer (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 3b-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of February 28, 2019 (being the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019), and therefore ceased to be eligible to rely on the rules and forms available to foreign private issuers on August 31, 2019.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS



Suspension of trading on the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”)



The Company is under a cease trade order invoked by the TSXV on August 6, 2021.



The Company filed the 2021 Q3 Filings on SEDAR and with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on August 19, 2021. In addition, on August 19, 2021, the Company’s amended financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis ‎for the eight quarters from May 31, 2019 to February 28, 2021 were filed on SEDAR and with the SEC, as contained in the Company’s amended annual reports on Form 10-K/A for the financial years ended August 31, 2019 and August 31, 2020, and in the Company’s amended quarterly reports on Form 10-Q/A for the periods ended May 31, 2019, November 30, 2019, February 29, 2020, May 31, 2020, November 30, 2020 and February 28, 2021. The Company’s amended financial statements and management discussion and analysis for the period ended February 28, 2019 were filed on SEDAR on August 23, 2021, and with the SEC on August 25, 2021, as exhibits to the Company’s current report on Form 8-K.



As a result of the issuance of the TSXV Cease Trade Order (“CTO”) on August 6, 2021, the Exchange suspended trading of the Company’s Common Shares. As part of the Exchange’s review of the Company’s reinstatement application, the Exchange reviewed the Company’s financial statements for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2021 and raised concerns over unapproved filings. As a result of an internal investigation the Company identified several transactions (“Transactions”) reported in SEDAR (“Canada”) and EDGAR (“United States”) that had not been submitted for approval by the Toronto Stock Exchange.



Based on the Company’s initial review of the Transactions, it is estimated that a total of 54,370,814 Common Shares were issued as a result of the Transactions.‎ While some of the issued Common Shares, namely, 4,336,972, are estimated to have been issued at prices above what the Exchange ‎would have otherwise approved, 50,033,842 are estimated to have been issued at share prices below what the Exchange ‎generally approves for convertible securities.‎ While the Company is now making the necessary submissions to the Exchange for the Transactions, they may not all be accepted for approval by the Exchange and as a condition to reinstatement of trading on the Exchange the Company may need to take remedial action to ensure that Transactions are in compliance with the Exchange.



The net proceeds of the Transactions that resulted in new funds to the Company were used for expansion of the Company’s oil sands processing plant in Utah and for working capital.‎



The Company continues to work with the Exchange on a reinstatement of trading and will update the market as developments warrant. However, the Exchange has indicated that these matters and their review of the Transactions may take some time to resolve and that a reinstatement to trading is not expected in the near term.

Unsolicited takeover bid by Viston United Swiss AG



On October 27, 2021, 2869889 Ontario Inc., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Viston United Swiss AG commenced a conditional, unsolicited takeover bid (the “Offer”) to acquire all of the issued and outstanding Common Shares of the Company. Viston filed a Tender Offer Statement with the SEC relating to the Offer on Schedule TO under section 14(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), on October 25, 2021, and an amendment to the Tender Offer Statement on October 27, 2021. As set forth in the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 under section 14(d)(4) of the Exchange Act filed with the SEC on November 9, 2021, shareholders were advised that the Board of Directors was not yet in a position to make a recommendation to shareholders to accept or reject the Offer, and that the Company has retained Haywood Securities Inc. as financial advisor to the Company and the Board of Directors.



Exchange of mineral leases



Under the terms of an agreement dated October 15, 2021 between Petroteq Oil Recovery, LLC and TMC Capital, LLC, two of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries, and Valkor Energy, LLC (the “Exchange Agreement”), Petroteq Oil and TMC Capital agreed to assign to Valkor all of their respective rights and interests in the TMC Mineral Lease located near Temple Mountain in the Asphalt Ridge area of Uintah County, Utah, including interests under a sublease to a Short-Term Mining Lease obtained by Valkor in August 2020, and in three Utah state oil sands leases that are contiguous to or in close proximity to the lands encompassed by the TMC Mineral Lease.



In a separate agreement, Valkor granted to provide TMC Capital the right to participate, at up to a 50% working interest, in any future operations conducted by Valkor under the TMC Mineral Lease or the Short-Term Mining Lease held by Valkor covering acreage formerly included in the TMC Mineral Lease, or on any of the lands covered by either of the leases.



To complete the exchange under the Exchange Agreement, Valkor agreed to assign to TMC Capital all of its rights and interests in three Utah state oil sands leases located in Uintah County, Utah, in an area referred to as Asphalt Ridge Northwest (the “Asphalt Ridge NW Leases”), including the “record lease title” and all of the operating rights (i.e. working interests) under the leases.



In a separate agreement, TMC Capital agreed to assign to Valkor the operating rights under the three Asphalt Ridge NW Leases at subsurface depths below 500 feet, with TMC Capital retaining a right to participate, at up to a 50% working interest, in any operation conducted by Valkor at the deeper intervals.  Under this agreement, each party will have the right to participate, at up to a 50% joint ownership basis, in any new oil sands processing plant constructed on lands covered by the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases.



As of October 28, 2021, each of the agreements and assignments required to consummate the reciprocal assignment of leases between the Company’s subsidiaries and Valkor has been executed and all of the transactions have been tentatively completed, subject to the approvals that must be obtained from the State of Utah’s School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA). 



The exchange of mineral properties between the Company’s subsidiaries and Valkor - resulting in the Company’s acquisition of record title and all interests under the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases - creates substantial benefits and opportunities for the Company, including:




(a) | The Asphalt Ridge NW leases contain an oil sands deposit that is contiguous within a single contained area. This will allow for greater efficiencies in mining and in ore transport operations. By contrast, the original TMC Mineral Lease in the Temple Mountain area of Asphalt Ridge encompasses three separate deposits running along a trend over about 8 miles, a structural outlay requiring substantial development and transport costs. 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | Based on historical well data from deposits adjacent to and surrounding the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases, the oil content or saturation in the deposit of oil sands within the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases is expected to average in the range of 12% by weight. In contrast, the oil sands ores mined or produced from lands within the TMC Mineral Lease in the Temple Mountain area have an average oil content or saturation in the range of 6% by weight. The higher oil content in the oil sands deposit located within the Asphalt NW Leases should provide for better yields per ton of bulk oil sand processed and improved project economics for a 5,000 barrel per day commercial plant that is being considered by the Company in this area.
(c) | Because a substantial part of the oil sands deposit within the Asphalt Ridge NW Leases is close to the surface and extends into various outcroppings, extraction and production may be conducted by surface mining where less overburden will need to be removed before initiating mining operations.
