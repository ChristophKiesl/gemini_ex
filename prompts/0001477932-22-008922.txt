ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Trutankless, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on March 7, 2008. The Company is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona and currently operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bollente, Inc., a Nevada corporation incorporated on December 3, 2009.

Trutankless is involved in research and development, sales, marketing, of a high quality, whole-house, smart electric tankless water heater that is more energy efficient than conventional products. Management anticipates the Company’s second generation of Trutankless water heaters, with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee capability. Trutankless’ proprietary app is expected to launch into the iOS and Android store, and will augment other products in the home automation space, including company’s leak detection and prevention devices which are also in development in the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Notation Labs, Inc. which was founded in 2020.

During the year ending 2021, the Company filed to spin off its wholly owned subsidiary, Notation Labs, Inc. with shareholders of the Company to receive pro rata ownership of the spun off company in the form of an equity dividend distribution. Common shares of Notation Labs, Inc. were issued to shareholders of record December 10th, 2021. The spin off occurred subsequent to the year ending 2021 on January 24th, 2022, with each shareholder of record receiving 1 share in the subsidiary for every 4 shares in the Company held as of the Record Date. 

Overview of Potential Markets and Summary of Marketing Plan

Management intends to focus on the United States residential market initially. For decades Americans have used only tank type water heaters, however the market is increasingly towards alternatives like tankless water heaters. Many brands are powered by natural gas, while several others use electricity. Almost half of American homes do not have natural gas available and there has been a trend in many markets towards renewable and cleaner energy alternatives to provide the energy to operate water heaters for the residential and commercial markets in North America.

The company’s focus markets favor electric water heaters, of which electric tankless have additional benefits over gas powered models because they can be installed almost anywhere in a home (closets, attics, utility rooms, etc.) where hot water is needed. The lack of exhaust, noise, and a need for combustible fuel improves flexibility of floor plan design for builders, architects, and remodelers. In addition, gas tankless water heaters may not be suitable for many applications due to challenges with adequate fuel supply, the need for exhaust vents with specific safety and regulatory requirements. Despite these issues, gas tankless water heaters have historically enjoyed significant growth in North America because of the efficiency and performance they provide.

The company will continue to focus its efforts to develop products that satisfy growing demand in the electric tankless market. Additionally, the company hopes to launch additional products well suited to its key customers in the repair and replacement wholesale market, as well as home builders and companies associated with new construction in the multifamily and commercial markets. 

Home Automation Overview

Key trends in the home automation space, which is estimated to reach $46.22 Billion worldwide by 2025, have been driven by consumers’ desire for efficiency and lifestyle improvements. Companies like Nest have helped to introduce the Internet of Things to appliances with a direct impact on how users interact with traditional household appliances and have the ability to reduce energy usage. The trend towards integration with voice assistants is also on the rise with key industry leaders like Alexa and Google Assistant playing larger roles in the home automation industry. Insurance and utility companies have joined this trend by partnering with home automation manufacturers by leveraging different devices to build insurance products including discounts and rebates. While home security and safety monitoring are expected to continue to dominate the overall market, management anticipates energy management and HVAC controls and monitors will be one of the fastest growing markets in the U.S. which accounts for 36% of global demand.

Trutankless was designed to replace inefficient tank water heating technology, which is second to HVAC in energy consumption for most homes. Combined with Wi-Fi capabilities, the system can not only save energy it has the ability to inform users and property owners of energy use, water use, and potential issues like leaks or other failures in the plumbing system. Management plans to roll out additional technologies in the future that can integrate with the Company’s trutankless smart apps. Currently, the product has the ability to notify homeowners in the event of water flow while the system is set in away mode. Leak detection, leak damage mitigation, and hot water recirculation for instant hot water at the point of use are becoming major trends in the home automation space. Management believes new products can be introduced into its growing wholesale network to augment trutankless’ momentum and harness growing trends to a fresh audience of plumbing and other home service professionals.

Homebuilders and plumbing companies have begun selling homes with more technology integrations. The company expects to gain market share based on its ability to offer tech forward products in the wholesale market which supplies plumbing, HVAC, and electrical service companies in the future.

Tankless Industry Overview

The U.S. gas tankless water heater market is dominated by several foreign and domestic brands; U.S. electric tankless water heater market is dominated by four companies; Stiebel-Eltron, Rheem (Eemax/EcoSmart), A.O.Smith, and Bosch, while tank manufacturers maintain the largest market share of the overall water heater market. Several Japanese and European manufacturers have begun marketing products in the United States, and since 2003, gas tankless products have experienced dramatic growth. Electric tankless systems have not experienced comparable growth due to several factors, primarily product performance, capacity, product quality and electrical power supply and installation issues. 

Manufacturers of tank heaters have a competitive advantage due largely to their product categories long established use, name recognition, established distribution and brand position in the marketplace. Many plumbers and other building industry professionals were opposed to changing brands or to tankless systems because many tankless water heaters have been poorly designed in the past. As a result, there is a perception among some contractors that these water heaters are more complicated and generally less dependable than traditional tank heaters. This perception is often passed along to consumers when making buying decisions or inquiring about switching to a tankless water heater.

While we believe that our products will have superior performance, such as endless hot water, superior longevity, greater efficiency and lower “life-cycle” costs than traditional tank water heaters, the Company’s success will depend to a large degree on the successful conversion of traditional water heater buyers to tankless water heater buyers. The acquisition price of tankless water heaters (both gas and electric) is greater than traditional tank water heaters, but the overall cost of ownership will be less than that of traditional tank technologies under typical circumstances. Although the public’s awareness of tankless systems has grown in recent years, and continued growth in the sector is suggestive of increasing awareness of tankless as a viable solution for American homeowners.

Our marketing and promotion plans have been developed to increase the awareness of the Company’s brand as the preferred option to traditional tank systems. Trutankless intends to position itself and its brand to capitalize on the shift to more sustainable construction materials and more efficient systems and appliances.

Growth Strategy

Trutankless’ product launched in the first quarter of 2014 and was sold through the wholesale plumbing distribution channel. Gas tankless manufacturers’ support of this sales channel was critical in their ability to quickly capture appreciable market share in the replacement market estimated to be larger than $4 Billion nationwide. No electric tankless has been available solely through wholesale distributors which welcomed the arrival of Trutankless. Trutankless’ sales and service training programs geared towards plumbers and contractors are the primary focal point of the Company’s sales strategy to quickly scale sales and educate distributors, plumbers, builders, and contractors.

The Company is also leveraging online marketing strategies and social media. By continually building an immersive and educational web experience at www.trutankless.com. Trutankless is efficiently building brand awareness among consumers. Launch efforts are expected focused in Arizona, Texas, and the Southeast which accounts for over 1,000,000 electric water heater shipments annually. Licensing and co-branding opportunities are being assessed, since strategic partnerships would eliminate the channel conflicts that have historically obstructed previous electric tankless entries in the marketplace. In the future we may pursue co-branding opportunities to accelerate sales of Trutankless’ products through retail channels.

In addition, we have determined that as part of our growth strategy, we will seek to partner with or acquire entities operating in various fields, with a bias towards green and “clean-tech” sectors. Our management has experience in marketing, product launches, business development strategies, and certain other areas specific to the success of growth companies. We will operate with a view towards identifying acquisition candidates as we seek the rights to provide the market with products and services geared toward environmental responsibility, innovative technology in the plumbing industry, and home automation technology.

We have identified several agents who are well suited to provide consulting to high-growth technology and consumer products companies. We are currently seeking partnership with companies in the green and “clean-tech” sectors possessing technologies, products, or expertise that would help create additional revenues and assist the Company with our own development efforts and product line expansion in the wholesale and retail plumbing channels.

Margin Expansion

Cost reduction measures, including outsourcing of key components and certain quality control testing protocols, are currently being undertaken on an expedited basis to rapidly reduce costs and improve manufacturing scalability. Such reductions are expected to take place in stages over the next eighteen months, and we believe may result in gross sales margins approaching 50% or more.
Market Outlook

Trutankless entered the market in front of the largest water heater replacement cycle ever at a time when homeowners are seeking ways to reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing comfort. Additionally, statistics have shown a trend towards electric water heating in new construction markets. Florida, Texas, and Arizona, and areas where electric water heaters dominate the market, have been epicenters of the residential new construction strength in the US. In the new construction market, builders are increasingly marketing “green” features and trutankless fits well along with other energy saving innovations.

In commercial markets, we feel that our commercial line of trutankless products are well suited to thousands of customers in the retail, quick serve and fast casual restaurants, hair salons, education. In addition to residential new construction and replacement markets, we feel the commercial applications for which our products are appropriate represent a large portion of the commercial water heater market.

In April 2015, the Federal Government mandated that standard electric water heaters over 55 gallons may not be sold (started effectively forcing the market to use alternative technologies like tankless water heaters. The “electrification” of the overall appliance market has also begun due to the rapid progression of energy generation technologies with more efficient and renewable energy sources seen as a growing and sustainable trend.

Investment Analysis

Trutankless has entered the market with a product that has enjoyed significant trends towards tankless water heating to displace gas tankless water heaters thus far. As a result of the market share growth of gas tankless, we believe TKLS is poised to produce exceptional results in the significant electric water heating market. Management has plans to significantly reduce the cost of goods sold and develop other innovations to supplement existing offerings which will be sold through the existing sales channels and reps which to help ensure sustainable growth over the next 3-5 years.

Target Markets

The United States market for residential tank water heaters in 2019 was more than 8.5 million units according to data released by the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI). Almost 50% of those shipments were electric water heaters, and the company has found in comparing those statistics with government data, that approximately 90% of tank water heaters shipped in 2019 were intended for “replacement” installations.

Trutankless is initially marketing its products to contractors, home builders, remodelers and distributors in the southern and western U.S. These areas of the country have been selected because of generally higher ground water temperatures, which improves the effects of the performance and capacity of all brands of tankless water heaters. This area of the country also traditionally has the largest share of population growth and new housing starts, accounting for almost two-thirds of all housing starts in 2019, according to recent data. Additionally, the southern U.S., and specifically the southeastern U.S., has the highest usage of electric water heaters.

Distribution Plan

Initially, we will be distributing our first product line throughout the southern and western U.S. using an existing network of plumbing and electrical wholesalers (distributors), manufacturers’ representatives and dealers. We believe that we will continue building existing partnerships with major companies in the building and plumbing industries to rapidly expand awareness of Trutankless and our products in the water heater market in the U.S and Canada.

Sales will continue to be pursued through the following channels:


1. | Regional and national plumbing and electrical wholesalers (also called “distributors”); 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Plumbers and electricians on a direct basis, in those areas where wholesalers have not yet been set up; and, 
3. | Builders on a direct basis, in those areas where wholesalers & mechanical contractors have not yet been set up.


We will expand sales of the product further by marketing the product directly to consumers over the internet with a series of aggressive and ongoing marketing initiatives. We intend to market to industry professionals and end-users through more traditional marketing efforts as well, including print advertising, attendance of select national trade shows, and attendance of select regional consumer shows. We also expect Trutankless will be successful in providing education, training, and support to our sales and installer networks as part of our distribution and marketing efforts.

We believe our products will be a differentiating factor for industry professionals and builders as they market to their customers. Additionally, our electric tankless products are expected to provide these professionals and their companies with a mechanism to increase revenue and improve gross margin as compared to more traditional water heating products.

Employees

We currently have six full-time employees, including our two officers, and two part-time employees. We expect to increase the number of employees to expand our sales and technical staff. We are using and will continue to use independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services. We believe that this use of third-party service providers may enhance our ability to contain operating, general expenses and capital costs.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.

On September 14th, 2021, a Company subsidiary received a demand for arbitration through the American Arbitration Association pursuant to a manufacturing services agreement with Cypress Holdings Ltd d/b/a Cypress Industries alleging Breach of Contract for non-payment of invoices. The Company believes the claim is without merit and has filed a defense and counter claim. After Cypress Industries failed to cure many Breaches of its manufacturing services agreement, including failure to deliver a single Trutankless unit, the Company cancelled its purchase order with Cypress Industries. The Company is seeking substantial relief, including lost profit, due to the Breach of Contract, Fraudulent Inducement, Misrepresentation, Unjust Enrichment, and Negligence of Cypress Industries. The Company subsequently settled this matter on February 28, 2022 and purchased material and unfinished goods from Cypress Holdings, Ltd d/b/a Cypress Industries with an estimated value of approximately $700,000 for $300,000.
