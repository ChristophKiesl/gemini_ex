ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Revance is a biotechnology company focused on innovative aesthetic and therapeutic offerings, including its next-generation neuromodulator product, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection combines a proprietary stabilizing peptide excipient with a highly purified botulinum toxin that does not contain human or animal-based components. We have successfully completed a Phase 3 program for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in glabellar (frown) lines and are pursuing U.S. regulatory approval. We are also evaluating DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in the full upper face, including glabellar lines, forehead lines and crow’s feet, as well as in two therapeutic indications—cervical dystonia and adult upper limb spasticity. To accompany DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, we own a unique portfolio of premium products and services for U.S. aesthetics practices, including the exclusive U.S. distribution rights to Teoxane SA’s line of Resilient Hyaluronic Acid® Collection of dermal fillers, the first and only range of FDA-approved fillers for correction of dynamic facial wrinkles and folds, and the HintMD platform, which provides an integrated smart payment solution that supports aesthetic practice management, practice economics and practice loyalty. We have also partnered with Viatris to develop an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, which would compete in the existing short-acting neuromodulator marketplace. We are dedicated to making a difference by transforming patient experiences. 
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Operations
The COVID-19 pandemic caused general business disruption worldwide beginning in January 2020. The health and safety of our team, their families and our communities remains our top priority. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we curtailed employee travel and implemented a corporate work-from-home policy in March 2020. We have continued to monitor the situation and have gradually resumed essential on-site corporate operations in accordance with local and regional restrictions. We have adopted remote working tools to minimize the disruption to the achievement of our goals and objectives for employees whose job duties do not require physical presence to complete their work. Certain manufacturing, quality and laboratory-based employees have continued to work onsite, and certain employees with customer-facing roles are onsite for training and interfacing in-person with customers in connection with the product launch of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers. If the severity, duration or nature of the COVID-19 pandemic changes, it may have an impact on our ability to continue on-site operations, which could disrupt our clinical trials and sales activities.
The COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to negatively affect our ability to obtain approval of product candidates from the FDA or other regulatory authorities, supply chain, end user demand for our products and commercialization activities. In November 2020, the FDA deferred a decision on the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar (frown) lines. The FDA reiterated that an inspection of our manufacturing facility is required as part of the BLA approval process, but the FDA was unable to conduct the required inspection of our manufacturing facility in Newark, California, due to the FDA’s travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA did not indicate there were any other review issues at the time beyond the on-site inspection. 
In addition, the product supply of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers was delayed by distribution partner Teoxane as they temporarily suspended production in Geneva, Switzerland as a precaution surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Teoxane resumed manufacturing operations at the end of April 2020 and delivered the first shipment of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers to us in June 2020. As a result, our initial product launch of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers was delayed by one quarter to September 2020. In addition, port closures and other restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt our supply chain or limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for the production of our products. We have taken steps to build sufficient levels of inventory to help mitigate potential future supply chain disruptions.
Our clinical trials have been and may continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has and may further delay enrollment in and the progress of our current and future clinical trials. Patients may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, enrollment in the JUNIPER Phase 2 adult upper limb spasticity trial was paused in March 2020 due to challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial was originally designed to include 128 subjects. Due to the 
COVID-19 challenges related to continued subject enrollment and the scheduling of in-person study visits, in June 2020, we announced the decision to end screening and complete the JUNIPER trial with the 83 patients enrolled to date. We released topline results from the Phase 2 study in February 2021.
To ensure proper clinical trial coordination and completion, in line with the FDA-issued guidance of March 18, 2020 on the Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during the COVID-19 Pandemic, we are evaluating and implementing risk-based approaches for remote clinical trial monitoring and activities, including remote patient assessment, for those subjects who cannot physically visit clinic sites, to ensure the full completion of trials.
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our BLA, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, end user demand for our products and services, commercialization efforts, business operations, clinical trials and other aspects of our business, the healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. As such, it is uncertain as to the full magnitude that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.
Commercial Transformation
In September 2020, Revance became a commercial company through our launch of the prestige aesthetics portfolio, which includes the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers and the HintMD platform.
RHA® Collection of Dermal Fillers
In January 2020, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement (the “Teoxane Agreement”) with Teoxane, as amended in September 2020, pursuant to which Teoxane granted us with an exclusive right to import, market, promote, sell and distribute Teoxane’s line of Resilient Hyaluronic Acid® dermal fillers, which include: (i) RHA® 2, RHA® 3 and RHA® 4, which have been approved by the FDA for the correction of moderate to severe dynamic facial wrinkles and folds (collectively, the "RHA® Collection of dermal fillers"), (ii) RHA® 1, for which FDA approval is targeted for the second half of 2021 for the treatment of perioral rhytids (lip lines), and is currently in ongoing clinical trials, and (iii) future hyaluronic acid filler advancements and products by Teoxane (collectively the “RHA® Pipeline Products”) in the U.S. and U.S. territories and possessions, in exchange for 2,500,000 shares of our common stock and certain other commitments by us.
In September 2020, we launched the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers in the U.S. The sale of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers generated $12.9 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. For additional information on our sales and marketing activities, see "Sales and Marketing" below.
HintMD Acquisition
On July 23, 2020, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of HintMD (the “HintMD Acquisition”), and HintMD became a wholly owned subsidiary of Revance. The total number of shares of our common stock issued as consideration for the HintMD Acquisition was 8,572,213, including (i) 683,200 shares of our common stock which are held in an escrow fund for purposes of satisfying any post-closing purchase price adjustments and indemnification claims under the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 18, 2020 by and among Revance, Heart Merger Sub, Inc., our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, HintMD, and Fortis Advisors, LLC, as the security holder’s representative (the "HintMD Merger Agreement") and (ii) assumed options to purchase an aggregate of 801,600 shares of our common stock.
The HintMD platform provides a seamless, simple and smart payment solution that enables medical aesthetic practices (the “practices”) to improve practice management and economics and foster loyalty with customers, which completes the value chain of our aesthetics portfolio and aligns with our goal to improve outcomes for patients and practices. The HintMD Acquisition leverages our existing and planned commercial infrastructure, and, we believe this financial technology service offering will enable us to grow our U.S. aesthetics business. 
HintMD is a registered payment facilitator ("PayFac") and enables practices to process payments for their patients and provides subscription and pay-over-time solutions that support practices' aesthetic treatment plans. The HintMD platform currently generates revenues through (i) credit card processing revenues net of interchange and other fees and (ii) monthly per patient fees for practices that use the subscription capabilities. The next-generation HintMD platform, which is scheduled to 
launch in mid-2021, is anticipated to operate as a fully integrated PayFac pursuant to the Payment Facilitator Agreement (as defined below) with a third-party acquirer and sponsor bank. The next-generation HintMD platform will earn revenue primarily by charging fees for completing payment transactions for practices and other payment-related services that are typically based on the volume of activity processed on the platform. 
Upon the close of the HintMD Acquisition, we onboarded 75 employees into our workforce, and all HintMD operations began being conducted by Revance employees. Certain business integration projects remain ongoing. Following our acquisition of HintMD, we began to operate in two reportable segments: (1) our product segment, which refers to the business that includes the research and development of innovative aesthetic and therapeutic products, including DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for various indications, the U.S. distribution of the RHA® Pipeline Products, and an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar in partnership with Viatris, and (2) our service segment, which refers to the business of the HintMD platform. For additional information about our business segments, see Part IV, Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules—Notes to consolidated financial statements—Note 4—Business Combination.”
Our Strategy
Our objective is to be a leading provider of botulinum toxin products across multiple aesthetic and therapeutic indications and to expand the opportunity for botulinum toxin products and other complimentary products, including hyaluronic acid dermal fillers and the HintMD platform. To achieve this objective, we plan to develop and commercialize proprietary, patent-protected product candidates, such as DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, commercialize the RHA® Pipeline Products in the U.S., participate in the development and commercialization of an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar with Viatris and leverage the HintMD platform to augment our aesthetics product offering.
Key elements of our strategy are:
•We plan to leverage DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection’s unique duration profile to build valuable franchises in aesthetics and therapeutics, which includes commercializing complimentary products like the RHA® Pipeline Products and the HintMD platform. We believe DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection has the ability to expand the neuromodulator opportunity by appealing to patients who seek a long-lasting effect. We also believe other possible formulations can expand the overall neuromodulator market. 
•We have and will continue to selectively evaluate partnerships, distribution opportunities, joint development agreements and acquisitions as a way to expand our aesthetic and therapeutic franchises while enhancing our competitive position. We have potential to expand to the second largest neuromodulator market with strategic partnerships like the license agreement (the “Fosun License Agreement”) with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Industrial Development Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd (“Fosun”), whereby we have granted Fosun the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau (the “Fosun Territory”). Further, we have entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Viatris (the “Viatris Collaboration”), pursuant to which we are collaborating with Viatris exclusively, on a world-wide basis (excluding Japan), to develop, manufacture and commercialize an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, which provides us with the potential to participate in the short acting neuromodulator opportunity.
•We will use recently announced results from three clinical trials in therapeutic indications – cervical dystonia, which was released in October 2020, upper limb spasticity, which was released in February 2021, and plantar fasciitis, which was released in November 2020, to inform our commercial strategy in the therapeutics market. 
•We aim to transform the practice and patient experience in the aesthetics market through the HintMD platform. The HintMD platform aims to improve practice management, assist with the creation of revenue opportunities and increase patient retention for practices.
The Botulinum Toxin Opportunity
 Botulinum toxin is a protein and neurotoxin produced by clostridium botulinum. Since 1989, botulinum toxin has been used to treat a variety of aesthetic and therapeutic indications in the U.S. and globally. Botulinum toxin blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to acceptor sites on motor or sympathetic nerve terminals, entering the nerve 
terminals, and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. This inhibition occurs as the neurotoxin cleaves SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within nerve endings. When injected intramuscularly at therapeutic doses, botulinum toxin produces partial chemical denervation of the muscle resulting in a localized reduction in muscle activity. Throughout this Report, we use neuromodulators to refer to botulinum toxins and neurotoxins.
In the U.S., neuromodulators have been approved to treat three aesthetic indications, glabellar lines, forehead lines and lateral canthal lines, although we believe neuromodulators may be widely used for other aesthetic indications. Four products, Abbvie’s BOTOX® Cosmetic, Ipsen, Galderma’s Dysport®, Merz’s Xeomin® and Evolus’s Jeuveau®, each of which is delivered in an injectable form, have been approved for the treatment of glabellar lines in the U.S. Neuromodulators have been approved for a variety of therapeutic indications including cervical dystonia, upper limb spasticity, chronic migraine, blepharospasm, strabismus associated with neurological movement disorders, hyperhidrosis, overactive bladder and, most recently, lower limb spasticity. 
According to Millennium Research Group, LLC ("MRG"), the global market opportunity for neuromodulators was estimated to be $4.5 billion in 2020 compared to $4.8 billion in 2019. Although the market contracted slightly from 2019 to 2020, we believe the contraction is due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the market is projected to reach approximately $8 billion by 2025, registering a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 9.2% over the analysis period of 2019 to 2025. We estimate that the market opportunity for therapeutics and aesthetics in 2020 is approximately 51% and 49%, respectively. We expect continued growth to be driven by demographics, changing lifestyle, new indications and product launches in new geographies. We intend to pursue indications in both the aesthetic and therapeutic markets to address this potential commercial opportunity by providing a neuromodulator product with longer-lasting duration than existing treatments in the market, while also partnering with Viatris to offer a short-acting botulinum toxin neuromodulator that will enable us to bring a biosimilar to the branded biologic product (onabotulinumtoxinA) marketed as BOTOX®. 
For additional information on competition we face in these markets, please see "Competition" below.
The Opportunity for Neuromodulators for Aesthetic Indications
Injectable neuromodulator treatments are the single largest cosmetic procedure in the U.S. and globally. According to MRG, neuromodulator aesthetic injections continued to be the most frequently performed aesthetic injectable procedure in the U.S. in 2019, with 7.9 million procedures performed, which represents an increase of 7% over 2018. Also, according to MRG, the global aesthetic neuromodulator market opportunity was estimated to be $2.2 billion in 2020 compared to $2.5 billion in 2019. Although the market contracted slightly from 2019 to 2020, we believe the contraction is due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the global aesthetic neuromodulator market is projected to reach approximately $4.2 billion by 2025, registering a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 8.9% over the analysis period of 2019 to 2025. We believe that we are positioned to take advantage of this growing market opportunity because results from our Phase 3 clinical program for the treatment of glabellar lines with DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection showed a median time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity of 24 weeks (6 months) and a median time to return to baseline wrinkle severity of approximately 28 weeks (7 months). According to the prescribing information from other neuromodulators on the market, duration of effect is three to four months.
According to our 2018 Harris Poll survey results, 86% of the physicians surveyed want a neuromodulator that offers longer-lasting results than is available today, and 88% of the patients consider long lasting duration very important or absolutely essential. In addition, our primary qualitative market research among aesthetic physicians, patients, and office practice managers indicated that longer duration than what is currently available on the market is a differentiating and desirable attribute. Most of those physicians interviewed reported that if DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection provided results consistent with our Phase 3 trials, the duration of effect would cause them to change their treatment or purchase habits from currently available neuromodulators to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. 
We believe that a product which shows persistence of effect over time, with a slow return to baseline and a meaningful consumer benefit of up to six months, would be a better treatment regimen and would align with existing customer habits. Quantitative market research shows most consumers visit their physicians less than twice per year for treatments. A product with a longer duration would enable patients to remain more satisfied between treatments. 
The Opportunity for Neuromodulators for Therapeutic Indications
Currently approved neuromodulator products may be better known for their aesthetic applications, but they have been developed and used in a wide range of therapeutic indications. According to MRG, the fastest-growing segment for neuromodulator treatments globally is for therapeutic indications, including neuromodulator products as a treatment for cervical dystonia, upper limb spasticity, chronic migraine headache, lower limb spasticity, urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, hyperhidrosis and pediatric detrusor overactivity. In addition, neuromodulator products are being evaluated in clinical trials in multiple other therapeutic indications including acne, rosacea, skin and wound healing, scar reduction, hair loss treatments, and several musculoskeletal and neurological conditions.
We believe there is opportunity to improve injectable neuromodulator use in neurological movement and other disorders. Muscle movement disorders are neurological conditions that affect a person’s ability to control muscle activity in one or more areas of the body. Muscle spasticity happens after the body’s nervous system has been damaged, most commonly by a stroke, trauma or disease. Muscle spasticity can be painful and may have a significant effect on a person’s quality of life. Certain tasks, like getting dressed or bathing, become difficult, and a person’s self-esteem may be affected by an abnormal posture. 
Common muscle movement disorders include cervical dystonia and upper or lower limb spasticity. Cervical dystonia affects approximately 60,000 people in the U.S. alone. In 2020, the global market opportunity for cervical dystonia was $390 million. Upper limb spasticity affects approximately 500,000 people in the U.S. and approximately 12 million people globally. According to MRG, the global spasticity market in 2019 was approximately $620 million and is expected to grow to $1.1 billion by 2025. We are currently conducting clinical programs evaluating DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of cervical dystonia and upper limb spasticity and believe that DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection may provide a treatment option for other neurological movement and other disorders.
 Botulinum toxin type A has been proven safe and effective for muscle movement disorders, including cervical dystonia and upper limb spasticity and is commonly used to treat muscle movement disorders. However, such injections must be repeated every three to four months and require large doses. As a result of the discomfort associated with muscle movement disorders, currently available treatments require up to four visits per year. We believe that there is a significant need for a long-lasting and targeted injectable neuromodulators like DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. We believe DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection has the potential to offer patients significantly more value by reducing the frequency of visits for treatments and offering a meaningful extension of symptom relief, while also providing a more beneficial pharmacoeconomic profile to the healthcare system. 
The Hyaluronic Acid Dermal Filler Opportunity
Dermal fillers are injected into the superficial and deep layers of the skin to restore volume, smooth lines, provide facial lift and contour, plump the lips or improve the appearance of facial scars commonly caused by acne. Hyaluronic acid dermal fillers represent 88% of the total U.S. dermal filler market, and according to MRG, hyaluronic acid dermal fillers were the second largest non-surgical procedure performed in aesthetic medicine. Hyaluronic acid is naturally found in the body, primarily in the skin, joints and connective tissue. With age, human skin loses its ability to produce hyaluronic acid, resulting in loss of volume, firmness and elasticity. Hyaluronic acid dermal fillers are manufactured from synthesized hyaluronic acid cross-linked to significantly enhance durability in the skin. These products can restore lost volume for six to 12 months or longer before the body gradually and naturally absorbs the hyaluronic acid. Most hyaluronic acid dermal fillers also contain lidocaine to help minimize discomfort during and after treatment. 
 In 2019, MRG estimated that 2.3 million hyaluronic acid dermal filler procedures were performed in the U.S. According to MRG, the U.S. market opportunity for hyaluronic acid dermal fillers was estimated to be $1 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach approximately $1.9 billion by 2025, registering a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 9.1%. We believe the RHA® Pipeline Products, for which we have exclusive U.S. distribution rights through our partnership with Teoxane, gives us the capability to successfully compete in this market. The RHA® Collection is the first and only FDA-approved dermal fillers for the correction of dynamic facial wrinkles and folds, and it represents the latest advancements in hyaluronic acid filler technology. The dermal filler range is created using a novel and gentle manufacturing process called preserved network technology ("PNT") that has few chemical modifications. The PNT process helps preserve the natural structure of the hyaluronic acid, allowing it to more closely mimic the natural hyaluronic acid found in the skin. 
The result is a hyaluronic acid dermal filler that is easy to inject and gives patients a natural look. As of December 31, 2020, the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers achieved a 10% share of the facial hyaluronic acid markets in the largest five European countries by gross domestic product ("GDP"). Teoxane is also the only company in the largest five countries by GDP to capture competitive market share without a complementary neuromodulator product offering. 
Hyaluronic acid dermal fillers provide a foundation from which to launch other aesthetic products, such as DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved. We believe hyaluronic acid dermal fillers have the potential to complement our premium aesthetics offering, and we believe will strengthen the commercial acceptance and use of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved. Our ability to offer a comprehensive aesthetics portfolio including the RHA® Pipeline Products and DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved, positions us to effectively compete with established competitors that leverage a portfolio of facial injectables including both neuromodulators and dermal fillers.

The Aesthetic Practice Fintech Opportunity 
The HintMD platform provides a seamless, simple and smart payment solution that enables practices to improve practice management and economics and foster loyalty with customers, which completes the value chain of our aesthetics portfolio and aligns with our goal to improve outcomes for patients and practices. We believe that the HintMD platform will enable us to grow our U.S. aesthetics market opportunity and give us access to the aesthetic practice payment processing market and recurring aesthetic practice subscription revenue. 
In 2019, the U.S. aesthetic practice payment services ("fintech") market was estimated to generate more than $500 million in revenue based on a growing base of 33,000 aesthetic practices processing an estimated $56 billion. On average, credit card processors charge 0.5% to 1% to complete a financial transaction depending on a variety of factors such as the type of credit card, whether or not the card is physically present and other variables. With the expected growth of the aesthetic market, the revenue for the U.S. aesthetic practice fintech market is expected to grow to approximately $700 million by 2025.

Product Pipeline Summary
Our Product Candidates    
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection
We are developing new innovations in neuromodulators for aesthetic and therapeutic indications. Our lead product candidate, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, combines a proprietary stabilizing peptide excipient with a highly purified botulinum toxin that does not contain human or animal-based components. DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection has demonstrated high response rates and long duration of effect. We are currently focusing on developing DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of both aesthetic and therapeutic indications.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection Aesthetics
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Glabellar Lines
Glabellar Lines, often called “frown lines,” are vertical lines that develop between the eyebrows and may appear as a single vertical line or as two or more lines. When one frowns, the muscles of the glabella contract causing vertical creases to form between the eyebrows. Neuromodulators are used to temporarily block the ability of nerves to trigger contraction of the injected muscle, inhibiting movement of the muscles that cause the frown lines, giving the skin a smoother, more refreshed appearance. Current treatments include neuromodulator injections, dermal fillers, laser treatments and topical creams.
Clinical Trials. DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection was studied in two early clinical trials in Glabellar Lines that established the dose that was taken forward into the Phase 3 program. The Phase 3 clinical program for Glabellar Lines included three studies: two 36-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single administration of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adults (SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2), and an 84-week, open-label safety trial designed to evaluate the long-term safety of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adults following both single and repeat treatment administration (SAKURA 3). 
Following our announcement of the top-line results for the SAKURA 3 trial, we submitted the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines in November 2019, which was accepted by the FDA on February 5, 2020, and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) target action date was initially set for November 25, 2020. On November 24, 2020, the FDA deferred its decision on the BLA. The FDA reiterated that an inspection of our manufacturing facility is required as part of the BLA approval process, but the FDA was unable to conduct the required inspection of our manufacturing facility in Newark, California due to the FDA’s travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Though our BLA is still under review, the FDA did not indicate there were any other review issues at the time beyond the on-site inspection.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Upper Facial Lines
Upper facial lines (“UFL”) is the name commonly given to the combination of the three most commonly treated facial areas with neuromodulators; specifically, glabellar lines, lateral canthal lines and forehead lines. In clinical practice a large proportion of patients seek treatment in all three areas to address signs of aging.
In December 2019, we initiated a new multicenter, open-label Phase 2 trial for the treatment of the UFL (the “UFL Trial”) to understand the safety and efficacy, including potential dosing and injection patterns, of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, covering the upper facial lines. Interim Week 4 data from the Phase 2a studies in forehead lines and lateral canthal lines, which are discussed below, were used in the final design of the UFL Trial to optimize dosing and injection patterns. We released topline results from the UFL Trial in December of 2020. In the UFL Trial, 48 subjects were enrolled to receive a single treatment of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection with a total study duration of 36 weeks. Subjects concurrently received 40, 32, and 48 units of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection respectively in the glabellar complex, forehead and lateral canthal areas. The key endpoints for efficacy were the proportion of subjects achieving a score of none or mild wrinkle severity at maximum contraction (maximum frown, eyebrow elevation, and smile effort) at Week 4, as assessed on the Investigator Global Assessment Frown Wrinkle Severity, Investigator Global Assessment Forehead Wrinkle Severity, and Investigator Global Assessment Lateral Canthal Wrinkle Severity, respectively. The proportion of subjects achieving a score 
of none or mild at Week 4 were 95.8%, 95.8% and 91.7% for glabellar lines, forehead lines and lateral canthal lines, respectively. The UFL Trial measured duration of effect in responders (those who achieved a score of none or mild at Week 4). These duration measures were defined as the median time to return to baseline wrinkle severity or the time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity, both based on investigator and subject assessments. The median time to return to base line was 33.3, 35.3 and 35.2 weeks, and the median time to loss of none or mild was 25.0, 24.0 and 28.1 weeks for glabellar lines, forehead lines and lateral canthal lines, respectively. DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection was generally well tolerated, and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events. The most common adverse events were injection site erythema (6.3%), facial discomfort (4.2%) and headache (2.1%). No eyelid or brow ptosis was reported.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Forehead Lines
Forehead lines are produced by the action of the frontalis muscle, a large, thin, vertically-oriented muscle which lifts the eyebrows. The frontalis muscle serves as an antagonist to the glabellar musculature, a natural depressor that is responsible for frowning and associated eyebrow movement. As the eyebrow is considered the aesthetic center of the upper face, forehead lines can significantly impact the aesthetic appearance of the face, contribute to increased signs of aging and convey unwanted social signals. Current treatments include neuromodulator injections, dermal fillers, laser treatments and topical creams.
In January 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the treatment of moderate or severe dynamic forehead lines in conjunction with treatment of the glabellar complex (the "Forehead Lines Trial"). The objective was to understand the potential dosing and injection patterns of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in other areas of the upper face in addition to the lead indication in glabellar lines. We released top-line results from the Forehead Lines Trial in June 2020. The primary endpoint for efficacy was the proportion of subjects achieving a score of none or mild in wrinkle or line severity at Week 4 at maximum eyebrow elevation for forehead lines. In the Forehead Lines Trial, 100% of subjects achieved a score of none or mild at Week 4 in at least one treatment group. DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection was well-tolerated at all dose levels. Adverse events were mild, localized and transient, and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events, as is common with other approved neuromodulators in the treatment of upper facial lines. One of the exploratory endpoints in the Forehead Lines Trial was duration of effect, defined as the median time to return to baseline wrinkle severity based on both investigator and patient assessment. At least one dose in the study demonstrated a median duration of effect of 27 weeks on forehead lines. Interim data from the Forehead Lines Trial was used in the final design of the UFL Trial to optimize dosing and injection patterns, which is discussed above in "DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Upper Facial Lines.”
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Lateral Canthal Lines
Lateral canthal lines (“LCL” or “crow’s feet”) are the spider-like fine lines around the outside corners of the eyes that become more obvious when someone smiles. These lines (also referred to as periorbital wrinkles, laugh lines or smile lines), fan out across the skin from the outer corner of each eye. Repetitive motions, such as squinting and smiling, can lead to the increase of wrinkles and contribute to the severity and onset of crow’s feet. Age and exposure to sun also play significant roles in development of these lines, which can deepen over time. Current treatments include eye creams and moisturizers, topical tretinoins, neuromodulator injections, dermal fillers and laser treatments. BOTOX® Cosmetic was approved to treat LCL in 2013 and is currently the only toxin approved for that use in the U.S., although other toxins are used off-label. 
In March 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the treatment of moderate or severe lateral canthal lines (the "LCL Trial"). The objective was to understand the potential dosing of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in the lateral canthal area. We released top-line results from the LCL Trial in June 2020. The primary endpoint for efficacy was the proportion of subjects achieving a score of none or mild in wrinkle or line severity at Week 4 at maximum smile for crow’s feet. In the LCL Trial, 88% of subjects achieved a score of none or mild at Week 4 in at least one treatment group. DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection was well-tolerated at all dose levels. Adverse events were mild, localized and transient as expected and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events, as is common with other approved neuromodulators in the treatment of upper facial lines. One of the exploratory endpoints in the LCL Trial was duration of effect, defined as the median time to return to baseline wrinkle severity based on both investigator and patient assessment. At least one dose in the study demonstrated a median duration of effect of 24 weeks on crow’s feet. Interim data 
from the LCL Trial was used in the final design of the UFL Trial to optimize dosing and injection patterns, which is discussed above in Part I, Item 1. “Business—DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Upper Facial Lines.”
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection Therapeutic
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection is being developed for a variety of therapeutic indications, including cervical dystonia and upper limb spasticity. We will continue to evaluate development for other therapeutic indications, such as migraine, neurological movement and other disorders, based on the results of our current preclinical studies and clinical trials.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Cervical Dystonia
Cervical dystonia is a chronic neurologic disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions of the head, neck, and shoulders, resulting in pain, abnormal movements and/or postural changes. While not life-threatening, cervical dystonia can be painful and may have a significant effect on a person’s quality of life. The cause of cervical dystonia is often unknown, and treatment with a neuromodulator is the current standard of care.
In May 2017, we announced top-line data from a 37-subject, Phase 2 dose-escalating study of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection to treat moderate to severe cervical dystonia. In 2018, we initiated the Phase 3 clinical trial program for cervical dystonia. ASPEN-1 Phase 3 is a 301-subject, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing two doses of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (125 Units and 250 Units) to placebo. In October 2020, we announced positive topline results from the ASPEN-1 trial. This pivotal study enrolled a total of 301 subjects at 60 sites in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Subjects were randomized 3:3:1 to receive a single treatment of either 125 Units or 250 Units of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, or placebo and were followed for up to 36 weeks. The drug appeared to be well-tolerated at both doses. The study met its primary efficacy endpoint at both doses, demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in the signs and symptoms of cervical dystonia at the average of Weeks 4 and 6. Compared to placebo, subjects treated with either 125 Units or 250 Units showed a statistically significant greater change from baseline as measured on the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale Total Score. Median duration of effect was 24.0 and 20.3 weeks, for the 125 Unit and 250 Unit dose groups respectively, based on the median time to loss of 80% of the peak treatment effect. There were no serious treatment-related adverse events and no dose-dependent increase in adverse events was observed. Treatment-related adverse events were generally transient and mild to moderate in severity, with one case of neck pain reported as severe, which resolved two days after onset. The three most common treatment-related adverse events were (for 125 Units and 250 Units, respectively): injection site pain (7.9%, 4.7%), headache (4.7%, 4.7%), and injection site erythema (4.7%, 2.3%). The incidence of dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and muscle weakness, which are considered adverse events of particular interest with neuromodulator treatments for cervical dystonia, was low (for 125 Units and 250 Units, respectively): dysphagia (1.6%, 3.9%) and muscular weakness (4.7%, 2.3%).
We completed the enrollment for ASPEN-OLS, a long-term safety study for cervical dystonia, with a total of 354 subjects and expect to release topline results in the second half of 2021. DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for cervical dystonia is expected to be our first therapeutic indication of which we are aiming for regulatory approval in 2023.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Adult Upper Limb Spasticity
Spasticity is a motor symptom characterized by rigidity, muscle tightness, joint stiffness, involuntary jerky movements, exaggeration of reflexes, unusual posture, abnormal positioning and muscle spasms and can affect the hands, fingers, wrists, arms, elbows or shoulders. Muscle spasticity happens after the body’s nervous system has been damaged, most commonly by a stroke or brain injury. While not life-threatening, spasticity can be painful and may have a significant effect on a person’s quality of life. Neuromodulators are one of several approved therapies for the treatment of adult upper limb spasticity. Other treatments include oral and intrathecal muscle relaxants, physical therapy, splints, casts & braces, electrical stimulation, and surgery.
In December 2018, we initiated the JUNIPER Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for adults with moderate to severe upper limb spasticity due to stroke or traumatic brain injury. In February 2021, we announced topline data from the JUNIPER Phase 2 trial. Subjects were assigned to one of three doses of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (250 units, 375 units, or 500 units) or to placebo. The trial was originally designed to include 128 subjects. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 challenges 
related to continued subject enrollment and the scheduling of in-person study visits, the Company made the decision in June 2020 to curtail enrollment at 83 subjects.
The study’s co-primary endpoints were improvement from baseline in the Modified Ashworth Score (“MAS”) and the Physician Global Impression of Change (“PGIC”) score at Week 6. In the JUNIPER trial, proof of concept was demonstrated with all three doses being numerically higher than placebo for the improvement in the MAS score, with the 500-unit dose demonstrating a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction from baseline in muscle tone versus placebo (p=0.0488). Additionally, each of the three doses demonstrated a numerical improvement compared with placebo on the PGIC assessment but did not reach statistical significance. 
The study was designed to run for up to 36 weeks, with the co-primary measures: mean change from baseline in muscle tone measured with the MAS in the suprahypertonic muscle group ("SMG" - the highest degree for muscle tone) of the elbow, wrist, or finger flexors at Week 6; and mean score of the PGIC at Week 6. The first 73 subjects, who were dosed before enrollment was paused in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were followed for up to 36 weeks, and the succeeding 10 subjects were followed up to Week 12.
On a key secondary endpoint, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection delivered a median duration of at least 24 weeks across all three doses. Duration of effect was defined as the time from injection (in weeks) until the loss of improvement as measured by the MAS (for the SMG) and the PGIC, or a request for retreatment by the subject. 
All three doses of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection were generally safe and well tolerated with no increase in the incidence of adverse events observed in the higher dose treatment groups. The majority of treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. 
The JUNIPER Phase 2 trial generated sufficient data to inform our dosing strategy for our Phase 3 program. In 2021, we plan to schedule an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA prior to finalizing a Phase 3 program. 
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Plantar Fasciitis
Plantar fasciitis is a painful affliction caused by inflammation of the ligament running along the bottom of the foot, which causes 80% of reported cases of heel pain. Neuromodulators are not currently approved for treating plantar fasciitis. In December 2018, we initiated a Phase 2 prospective, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two doses of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in reducing the signs and symptoms of plantar fasciitis. We released topline results in November 2020. The study’s primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline on the 10-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale ("NPRS") score averaged over five days at Week 8. In the trial, both doses of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection resulted in significant measurable pain relief after treatment that was numerically greater than placebo. However, neither dose met the primary efficacy endpoint of statistically significant improvement from baseline in the NPRS for foot pain at Week 8, compared to placebo. Subjects treated with DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection showed an average reduction from baseline of 3.29 on the NPRS (a 54.6% reduction) at 80U (p=0.2135 vs. placebo) and 3.25 on the NPRS (a 50.1% reduction) at 120U (p=0.2205 vs. placebo, p=0.9207 vs. 80U), compared to placebo subjects at 2.75 on the NPRS (a 45.1% reduction). DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection was found to be safe and well-tolerated at both doses through Week 24. There were no serious treatment-related adverse events and no dose dependent increase in adverse events was observed. Treatment-related adverse events were generally transient and mild to moderate in severity. Although the results of this study did demonstrate pain relief on the NPRS that was numerically greater from baseline than placebo, neither was statistically significant. As such, we are not currently pursuing the plantar fasciitis indication, and we will focus our efforts on indications for muscle movement and pain disorder indications where the use of neuromodulators is well-established.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Migraine
Migraine headache is a central nervous system disorder characterized as moderate to severe headache and often includes other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Migraine headache affects more than 38 million people in the U.S., of which more than 3 million of whom suffer from chronic migraine headache. Chronic migraine headache is both undertreated 
and underdiagnosed and is defined as more than fifteen headache days per month over a three-month period of which more than eight are migrainous, in the absence of medication overuse. 
We continue to evaluate the timing of the initiation of migraine clinical trials.
Topical
We are evaluating preclinically a topical program for indications currently served by neuromodulator treatments. A topical product presents several potential advantages, including painless topical administration, no bruising, ease of use and limited dependence on administration technique by physicians and medical staff. We believe these potential advantages may improve the experience of patients undergoing neuromodulator procedures and could make a topical product candidate suitable for multiple indications in the future. We may conduct additional preclinical work for a topical product candidate in therapeutic and aesthetic applications where neuromodulators have shown efficacy and are particularly well suited for injection-free treatments. 
Our Strategic Collaborations
The RHA® Pipeline Products
In January 2020, we entered into the Teoxane Agreement with Teoxane, pursuant to which Teoxane granted us with an exclusive right to import, market, promote, sell and distribute the RHA® Pipeline Products in the U.S. and U.S. territories and possessions, in exchange for 2,500,000 shares of our common stock and certain other commitments by us. Of the RHA® Pipeline Products, RHA® 2, 3 and 4, or the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers, have been approved by the FDA for the correction of moderate to severe dynamic facial wrinkles and folds. RHA® 1 is currently in ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of perioral rhytids (lip lines). Teoxane submitted the premarket approval application for RHA® 1 in January 2021 and is aiming for FDA approval in the second half of 2021. 
From June to August 2020, we completed the PrevU program, a pre-launch promotional program of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers, for select practices, including key opinion leaders. For additional information on the PrevU program, see “Sales and Marketing” below. In August 2020, we established our field sales team of approximately 100 members, and, in September 2020, we launched the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $12.9 million in product revenue and $4.8 million for cost of product revenue (exclusive of amortization) from the launch of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers. 
The Teoxane Agreement is effective for a term of ten years from product launch and may be extended for a two-year period upon the mutual agreement of the parties. In September 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to the Teoxane Agreement to memorialize a revised launch date from April to September as a result of delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement, we are required to meet certain minimum purchase obligations and certain minimum expenditure requirements, which are discussed in Part IV, Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules—Notes to consolidated financial statements— Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies." If Teoxane pursues regulatory approval for RHA® Pipeline Products for certain new indications or filler technologies, including innovations with respect to existing products in the U.S., we will be subject to certain specified cost-sharing arrangements for third party expenses incurred in achieving regulatory approval for such products. We will also have a right of first negotiation with respect to any cosmeceutical products that Teoxane wishes to distribute in the U.S, and Teoxane will have a right of first negotiation in connection with the distribution of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for aesthetic use outside the U.S. and U.S. territories where Teoxane has an affiliate. 
 OnabotulinumtoxinA Biosimilar
We entered into the Viatris Collaboration in February 2018, under which Revance and Viatris are collaborating exclusively, on a worldwide basis (excluding Japan), to develop, manufacture, and commercialize a biosimilar to the branded biologic product (onabotulinumtoxinA) marketed as BOTOX®. In February 2019, we had a biosimilar initial advisory meeting (“BIAM”) with the FDA and Viatris on a proposed onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar product candidate. Based on the FDA’s feedback, Revance and Viatris believe that a 351(k) pathway for the development of an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar is viable. 
In August 2019, we entered into an amendment to the Viatris Collaboration (the “Viatris Amendment”) which, among other things, extended the period of time for Viatris to make a decision under the Viatris Collaboration (the “Continuation Decision”) as to whether to continue the biosimilar development program beyond the initial development plan and the BIAM. In accordance with the Viatris Amendment, Viatris was required to notify us of the Continuation Decision on or before the later of (i) April 30, 2020 or (ii) 30 calendar days from the date that we provide Viatris with certain deliverables. Pursuant to the Viatris Amendment, Viatris agreed to pay us an additional $5.0 million above the previously agreed non-refundable upfront payment of $25.0 million with contingent payments of up to $100.0 million, in the aggregate, upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones, tiered sales milestones of up to $225.0 million, and royalties on sales of the biosimilar in the Viatris territories previously disclosed from the Viatris Collaboration. In June 2020, we announced that Viatris provided us its written notice of its Continuation Decision and paid us a $30 million milestone payment in connection with the Continuation Decision. We began the continuation phase of the onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar program and are moving forward with characterization and product development work, followed by an anticipated filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) with the FDA in 2022. Viatris has paid us an aggregate of $60 million in non-refundable fees as of December 31, 2020.
Fosun License Agreement
In December 2018, we entered into the Fosun License Agreement with Fosun, whereby we granted Fosun the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in the Fosun Territory and certain sublicense rights.
Fosun has paid us non-refundable upfront and other payments totaling $31.0 million before foreign withholding taxes as of December 31, 2020. We are also eligible to receive (i) additional remaining contingent payments of up to $229.5 million upon the achievement of certain milestones based on (a) the approval of BLAs for certain aesthetic and therapeutic indications and (b) first calendar year net sales, and (ii) tiered royalty payments in low double digits to high teen percentages on annual net sales. The royalty percentages are subject to reduction in the event that (i) we do not have any valid and unexpired patent claims that cover the product in the Fosun Territory, (ii) biosimilars of the product are sold in the Fosun Territory or (iii) Fosun needs to pay compensation to third parties to either avoid patent infringement or market the product in the Fosun Territory.
Our Technology
Our Proprietary Peptide Excipient Technology
Employing our proprietary peptide excipient technology may deliver improved performance when combined with other active drug macromolecules, as demonstrated in clinical trials with our lead candidate DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. 
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection Delivery of Botulinum Toxin
The DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection formulation incorporates our proprietary stabilizing peptide excipient along with the other excipients: polysorbate-20, buffers and a sugar. DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection will be supplied as a lyophilized powder which will require reconstitution with saline prior to injection. The highly positively charged peptide excipient has been shown to bind non-covalently to the daxibotulinumtoxinA molecule. The unique formulation of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection has permitted us to create a drug product without human serum albumin, found in all other FDA approved neuromodulator products. Preclinical and clinical data taken together suggest that DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection may provide long duration of effect at the target muscle with a safety profile consistent with currently approved neuromodulator products.
HintMD Platform
HintMD’s product offering includes the point of sale ("POS") platform, software and hardware terminal. The hardware terminal is manufactured by a third party manufacturer, and the POS platform and software are HintMD’s proprietary technologies. Another feature of the HintMD platform is a downloadable application on both Google’s Android 
and Apple’s iOS operating systems that allows patients to remotely interface with the practices’ terminals. The HintMD platform provides the below functionalities:
•Payment solution purposely built for aesthetics practices: HintMD’s POS platform provides a simple to use payment solution specifically designed for aesthetics practices, but also delivers insights about individual habits by integrating business intelligence into each practice with insights on patient visit counts, average patient spend, cross-selling patterns and revenue trends. The HintMD platform provides opportunities for practices to promote new treatments and products and introduce subscription plans. HintMD’s POS platform also integrates a range of administrative activities in one system to enable the scheduling of patient visits, viewing of patient information and processing of payments.
•Maximize membership through dynamic subscription programs: The HintMD platform allows physicians to design a personalized treatment plan for their patients using their recommended treatments and products on a subscription basis. Memberships give patients multiple payment options that are designed to fit a variety of budgets and provide flexible subscription options with the goal of enabling practices to offer a treatment regimen that is customized and affordable for the patient.
Manufacturing and Operations 
We have established capabilities for the production of botulinum toxin type A, including bulk drug substance and injectable finished drug product. Botulinum toxin is regulated as a Tier 1 Select Agent under authority of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), and as such requires that we obtain a select agent registration and perform our operations in compliance with CDC regulations. We are in good standing under our select agent registration with the CDC. We have assembled a team of experienced individuals in the technical disciplines of chemistry, biology, biosafety, and engineering and have appropriately equipped laboratory space to support ongoing research and development efforts in our botulinum toxin product development platform. We have the ability to manufacture our own botulinum toxin bulk drug substance to support our clinical trial programs and eventually, our commercial production. We also plan to use third-party manufacturers to further scale-up DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection drug product manufacturing to meet anticipated commercial demand in the event of BLA approval.
In March 2017, we entered into, and in December 2020, we amended a Technology Transfer, Validation and Commercial Fill/Finish Services Agreement (as amended, the “ABPS Services Agreement”) with Ajinomoto Althea, Inc. dba Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services (“ABPS”), a contract development and manufacturing organization. ABPS will serve as a dual supply source and provide drug product manufacturing services for us at its aseptic manufacturing facility in San Diego, California. The ABPS Services Agreement also mitigates supply chain risk by giving us a second manufacturing location for drug product manufacturing. The December 2020 amendment, among other things, modified ABPS’s dedicated manufacturing capacity and buyback obligations and our related payment obligations for our neuromodulator products, as well as provisions relating to the cancellation of product batches and the termination of the ABPS Services Agreement. Under the ABPS Amendment, we are subject to minimum purchase obligations of $8.0 million for the year ended in December 31, 2021, and $30.0 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024. 
We manufacture and perform testing for both bulk drug substance and finished dosage strengths of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. The additional components required for our product lines and the peptide for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection are manufactured by third parties under contract with us. Please see “Outsourced Components” for additional information.
 Drug Substance Manufacturing
Manufacture of the drug substance for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection is based on microbial fermentation followed by product recovery and purification steps. The process is entirely free of animal and human-derived materials and depends on standard raw materials available commercially. The process is already scaled to support expected future commercial demands. Bulk drug substance is stable when stored under required conditions, which allows us to establish reserves of drug substance and allows periodic drug substance production to replenish inventories as needed.
Drug Product Manufacturing
Manufacture of dose forms to support the DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection programs is currently performed at our fill-finish facility. The manufacturing process consists of bulk compounding, liquid fill and freeze-drying to support acceptable shelf-life duration. We plan to perform further scale-up of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection drug product manufacturing to meet anticipated commercial demand and may utilize current and additional internal capacity, a third-party manufacturer such as ABPS or a combination of both.
Outsourced Components
We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our botulinum toxin and the additional components required for our products, which includes the manufacture of bulk peptide. 
Our agreement with List Biological Laboratories, Inc. (“List Laboratories”), a developer of botulinum toxin, includes certain milestone payments related to the clinical development of our botulinum toxin products and the toxin manufacturing process. There is a royalty with an effective rate ranging from low-to-mid single-digit percentages of future sales of botulinum toxin. Our agreement with List Laboratories will remain in effect until expiration of our royalty obligations and may be terminated earlier on mutual agreement or because of a material breach by either party.
Our agreement with ABPS includes manufacture and supply of drug product in accordance with certain specifications. This agreement also includes certain quality control and inspection provisions through which we can ensure the satisfactory quality of our drug product. The ABPS Services Agreement has an initial term that will expire in March 2024, unless sooner terminated by either party in accordance with its terms.
Supply of the RHA® Collection of Dermal Fillers
The Teoxane Agreement granted us the exclusive right to import, market, promote, sell, and distribute the RHA® Pipeline Products in the U.S. The agreement is effective for a term of ten years and may be extended for two additional years upon mutual agreement, provided that agreed upon annual purchase and commercialization spend minimums are maintained. In September 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to the Teoxane Agreement to memorialize a revised launch date from April to September as a result of delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are a distributor of the RHA® Pipeline Products and are not involved in the manufacturing process.
Sales and Marketing 
From June to August 2020, we completed the PrevU program, a pre-launch promotional program of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers, for select practices, including key opinion leaders. The PrevU program, coupled with the ongoing RHA® Collection of dermal fillers education program, provided a solid foundation of experienced injectors to prepare for a full-scale rollout of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers.
In September 2020, we became a commercial company and launched the prestige aesthetics portfolio, which included the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers and the HintMD platform. We completed the onboarding and training processes for our 100 plus person field force team in August 2020. The team will also support the potential launch of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines if approval is received.
Intellectual Property 
Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, novel biological discoveries, and drug development technology and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary or intellectual property rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary and intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on know-how, copyright, trademarks and trade secret laws, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Such protection is also maintained using confidential non-disclosure agreements. Protection of our technologies is important for us 
to offer our customers proprietary services and products unavailable from our competitors, and to exclude our competitors from using technology that we have developed. If competitors in our industry have access to the same technology, our competitive position may be adversely affected.
It is possible that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire or develop, may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part. It is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents from our pending patent applications or other inventions we seek to protect. Due to uncertainties inherent in prosecuting patent applications, sometimes patent applications are rejected and we subsequently abandon them. It is also possible that we may develop proprietary products or technologies in the future that are not patentable or that the patents of others will limit or altogether preclude our ability to do business. In addition, any patent issued to us, or any of our pending patent applications, may provide us with little or no competitive advantage, in which case we may abandon such patent, or patent applications, or license them to another entity. Please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.” for more information. 
In June 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “BTRX Purchase Agreement”) with Botulinum Toxin Research Associates, Inc. (“BTRX”). Under the BTRX Purchase Agreement, we acquired all rights, title and interest in a portfolio of botulinum toxin-related patents and patent applications from BTRX and were granted the right of first negotiation and of right of first refusal with respect to other botulinum toxin-related patents owned or controlled by BTRX.
As of December 31, 2020, Revance, including HintMD, held approximately 465 issued patents and approximately 133 pending patent applications, including foreign counterparts of U.S. patents and applications. 43 of our patents are issued in the U.S., with the rest issued in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, various countries in Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa. In addition, we have pending patent applications in the U.S. as well as in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Singapore. The earliest that any of our U.S. patents will expire is July 20, 2021 for U.S. Patent No. 7807780. The latest that any of our U.S. patents will expire is July 20, 2035. We will continue to pursue additional patent protection as well as take appropriate measures to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our innovative technologies.
On May 2, 2018, Allergan plc filed an Opposition in the European Patent Office against our European Patent No. EP 2 661 276 titled “Topical composition comprising botulinum toxin and a dye.” While the opposed patent is not material to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, we continue to take appropriate measures to defend the patent and have appealed a decision to revoke the patent, which remains in force during the appeal. On May 2, 2019 our European Patent No. EP 2 490 986 B1 for “Methods and Systems For Purifying Non-Complexed Botulinum Neurotoxin” was opposed. We are vigorously defending this patent in the European Patent Office. We were informed in May 2019 that our patent application NC2018/0005351 pending in Colombia for “Injectable Botulinum Toxin Formulations And Methods of Use Thereof Having Long Duration of Therapeutic Effect” was opposed. We have responded to this pre-grant opposition. Furthermore, even if our patents and applications are unchallenged, they may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims.
Our registered U.S. trademarks include REVANCE®, MOTISTE®, “Remarkable Science Changes Everything®”, “Remarkable Science. Enduring Performance®”, R Logo® and SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR BEST SELF®.
Competition
We have entered and expect to continue to enter highly competitive pharmaceutical and medical device markets. Successful competitors have the ability to effectively discover, develop, test and obtain regulatory approvals for products, as well as the ability to effectively commercialize, market and promote approved products. Numerous companies are engaged in the development, financial, research, manufacture and marketing of healthcare products competitive with those that we are developing. Our competitors may also have more experience and expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Our competitors may be able to develop competing or superior technologies and processes, and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could. Our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. As more companies develop new intellectual property in our markets, the 
possibility of a competitor acquiring patent or other rights that may limit our products or potential products increases, which could lead to litigation. 
Based on our ongoing clinical trials and submission of our BLA to the FDA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in the treatment of glabellar lines, we will continue to pursue additional regulatory approvals for the indications supported in these trials. Initially, we expect to compete directly with competitors that sell an injectable neuromodulator product and dermal fillers in the markets where we have a labeled indication and/or regulatory clearance.
Injectable Botulinum Toxin Neuromodulators
Our primary competitors for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection globally are expected to be companies offering injectable dose forms of neuromodulators, including:
•BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic, which are marketed by Abbvie. The FDA approved BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic for multiple indications, including glabellar lines, forehead lines, crow’s feet, axillary hyperhidrosis, upper and lower limb spasticity, cervical dystonia, strabismus, blepharospasm, chronic migraine, incontinence, overactive bladder and pediatric detrusor overactivity. Abbvie is a leading global pharmaceutical company with significant research, discovery, and delivery capabilities. 
•Dysport®, an injectable neuromodulator, which is marketed by Ipsen Ltd. ("Ipsen") and Galderma. Dysport® has been approved for the treatment of glabellar lines, cervical dystonia, and upper and lower limb spasticity. Galderma has rights to market the product in the U.S. and Canada. Ipsen granted Galderma an exclusive development and marketing license for Dysport® for cosmetic indications in the European Union, Russia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and first rights of negotiation for other countries around the world, except the U.S., Canada and Japan. Galderma is Ipsen’s sole distributor for Dysport® in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. The health authorities of 15 European countries have also approved Dysport® for glabellar lines under the trade name Azzalure®.
•Myobloc® (rimabotulinumtoxinB), an injectable neuromodulator, which is marketed by US WorldMeds. The FDA approved Myobloc® for the treatment of cervical dystonia and chronic sialorrhea.
•Xeomin®, an injectable neuromodulator, which is marketed by Merz Pharma ("Merz"). The FDA approved Xeomin® for the treatment of glabellar lines, cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, upper limb spasticity and chronic sialorrhea. Xeomin® is also currently approved for the treatment of glabellar lines in Korea, Argentina and Mexico, and therapeutic indications in most countries in the European Union, Canada and certain countries in Latin America and Asia. Bocouture® (rebranded from Xeomin®), marketed by Merz, has approval for glabellar lines in Germany and the European Union.
•Jeuveau®, an injectable neuromodulator, which is marked by Evolus, Inc. ("Evolus") in the U.S. The FDA approved Jeuveau® for the treatment of glabellar lines only. Jeuveau® is also known as NABOTA® in South Korea as well as in other geographic areas and was designated Nuceiva™ in Canada. 
We are aware of competing neuromodulators currently being developed or commercialized in the U.S., Asia, South America and other markets. Some of these markets may or may not require adherence to the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice standards (“cGMPs”) or the regulatory requirements of the EMA or other regulatory agencies in countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While some of these products may not meet U.S. regulatory standards, the companies operating in these markets may be able to produce products at a lower cost than U.S. and European manufacturers. In addition to the injectable neuromodulator forms, we are aware that other companies are developing topical botulinum toxins for cosmetic and therapeutics indications and are conducting clinical trials for acne, facial aesthetic and hyperhidrosis.

HintMD has focused on aesthetic practices since inception and has developed a strong understanding of the unique needs and requirements of aesthetic practices. 
HintMD expects competition to increase in the future from both established competitors and new market entrants. Current competitors include:
•Incumbent payment processing solution providers, including Square and Stripe;
•Banks that offer payment solutions; and
•Electronic medical record systems that offer payment solutions, such as Modernizing Medicine and Nextech.
Government Regulations
Product Approval Process in the U.S.
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), its implementing regulations, and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our product candidates, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, are subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a BLA to the FDA and approval of the BLA by the FDA before marketing in the U.S.
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial sale and distribution and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold on clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current good laboratory practices (“GLPs”);
•submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials in the U.S. may begin;
•approval by an institutional review board ("IRB"), at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s current good clinical practices (“GCP”) regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of a BLA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection, if the FDA deems it as a requirement, of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, potency, quality and purity, as well as compliance with applicable Quality System Regulations (“QSR”), for devices;
•potential inspections by the FDA of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
•potential review of the BLA by an external advisory committee to the FDA, whose recommendations are not binding on the FDA; and
•FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale.
Preclinical Studies
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential toxicity and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance, or for other reasons. 
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and effectiveness. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of clinical trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into a limited population of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for some diseases, or when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy 
volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the disease or condition for which the product candidate is intended to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
•Phase 2. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population, but larger than in Phase 1, to identify possible adverse events and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to assess dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
•Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, and provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, such as several hundred to several thousand, at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. These trials typically have at least 2 groups of patients who, in a blinded fashion, receive either the product or a placebo. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Phase 4 trials can be initiated by the drug sponsor or as a condition of BLA approval by the FDA.
Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The submission of a BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees.
Once the FDA receives a BLA, it has 60 days to review the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete and the data are readable, before it accepts the BLA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA, the FDA has twelve months from submission in which to complete its initial review of a standard BLA and make a decision on the application, and eight months from submission for a priority BLA, and such deadline is referred to as the PDUFA date. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates for either standard or priority BLAs. The review process and the PDUFA date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA date. 
After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, potency, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound 
by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval and limit commercial opportunity.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA can inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional clinical testing or information before a BLA can be approved. 
The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the BLA. The complete response letter describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA during review. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, certain changes to the approved biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement must be submitted and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to a BLA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the supplement. As with new BLAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any biologic products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, known as “off-label use,” industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. The FDA and other agencies closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, and although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments but the FDA does restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. Failure to comply with these or other FDA requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, possible civil or criminal penalties or other negative consequences, including adverse publicity.
We currently manufacture clinical drug supplies using a combination of third-party manufacturers and our own manufacturing facility in order to support both of our product candidates and plan to do so on a commercial scale if our product candidates are approved. Our future collaborators may also utilize third parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such collaborator. We and our third-party manufacturers are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, 
quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our biologic product candidate, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible to be the basis for an application for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process, which coincides with the period of product development and regulatory review. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product may be extended, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within 60 days after drug approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension. In the future, we may apply for extension of patent term for one or more of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent term beyond the current expiration date of one of our patents, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s BLA. Specifically, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until twelve years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. However, an application may be submitted after four years, which initiates a process in which the innovator BLA holder and the biosimilar applicant identify patents that could be litigated and resolve patent disputes.
Product Approval Process Outside the U.S.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing manufacturing, clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure includes selecting one reference member state (“RMS”), and submitting to more than one member state at the same time. The RMS National Competent Authority conducts a detailed review and prepares an assessment report, to which concerned member states provide comment. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states post-initial approval. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors, customers, and others may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which 
we research, as well as, sell, market and distribute any product for which we obtain marketing approval. The federal and state fraud and abuse laws that restrict certain business practices in the biotechnology industry include but are not limited to anti-kickback and false claims statutes. 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute.
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and the federal civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free products to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. 
The federal transparency requirements under the ACA, commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, as defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and, and teaching hospitals and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information related to payments and other transfers of value provided in the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiology assistants, and certified nurse-midwives.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Similar state, local and foreign healthcare laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the biotechnology industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the 
relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, thus complicating compliance efforts.
In General
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities now and in the future could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government healthcare programs, integrity oversight and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
U.S. and Foreign Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations 
We are subject to federal laws and regulations that seek to protect U.S. consumers and patients and to govern the collection, use, maintenance, storage, disclosure, protection, transfer, and destruction (collectively, the “processing”) of information that directly or indirectly identifies individuals (“personal information”), including personal information of patients and consumers who reside in the United States. Additionally, state and local laws govern the protection of consumers and the processing of the personal information of a state’s residents processed by businesses operating inside or outside of their physical borders (collectively, these federal and state laws and regulations are referred to as “privacy laws”). Most federal privacy laws apply to our actions within specific industry sectors. The most significant of these privacy laws for us is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and each of their implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”), which applies to certain of our actions within the health care sector. HIPAA imposes strict privacy, security, and breach notification obligations and standards on “covered entities” related to their use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, defined by HIPAA as “protected health information” or “PHI”. Covered entities are defined under HIPAA to include healthcare providers that undertake certain electronic transmissions of PHI, such as submitting electronic claims for reimbursement for the treatment of patients. Many of our health care provider customers are considered to be covered entities. HIPAA also applies to companies that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI for or on behalf of a covered entity (called “business associates”). Even though we are generally not a covered entity or a business associate in our general business activities, HIPAA limits the amount of data including PHI that can be shared between our business and our health care provider customers. In certain of our activities, Revance or Hint also may be considered a business associate of Hint's aesthetic practice customers and directly subject to HIPAA, for instance when we enter into business associate agreements with covered entities related to our HintMD business, as discussed more below. We also may be subject to certain of HIPAA’s provisions as a covered entity related to our company health plan. HIPAA is generally enforced by the Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”) that can bring enforcement actions against companies that violate HIPAA’s privacy, security or breach notification rules and levy significant civil fines and/or require changes to the manner in which PHI is used and disclosed. The Department of Justice has jurisdiction under HIPAA to bring criminal enforcement actions against covered entities, business associates and possibly other entities for fraudulent misuse of PHI and other criminal acts. Further, HIPAA provides state attorneys general authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Further, if we are in possession of PHI as a business associate or as part of our health plan covered entity and we have an unauthorized use or disclosure of the PHI, we will be required pursuant to the HIPAA breach notification rule, to notify our customer covered entity, or notify patients, and/or OCR and HHS, of which OCR is a part. In addition to HIPAA, there could also be other federal privacy laws that might 
impact smaller parts of our operations such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act when we undertake employee screening and background checks. 
In addition to federal privacy laws, such as HIPAA, we are also subject to federal laws that apply to how we conduct consumer marketing and advertising. The most significant of these federal laws is Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTCA”), which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices directed toward consumers. The FTC has brought aggressive enforcement actions against companies they believe have made material misrepresentations on their website or mobile app privacy statements with respect to their processing of personal information of consumers. Additionally, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the “TCPA”) governs the manner in which we send mobile phone marketing and commercial messages to consumers. The Federal Communication Commission enforces the TCPA, however, the TCPA includes a private right of action with statutory damages and there have been lawsuits brought by private plaintiffs against biopharmaceutical and medical device companies. 
In addition, state privacy laws include consumer protection laws that are very similar to the FTCA and that are enforced by state attorneys general. Other state laws, including those that govern health information and may be more stringent than HIPAA, also govern our processing of personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating our compliance efforts, potentially increasing the financial costs of compliance, and exposure to liability. 
For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, and its subsequent implementing regulations (collectively, the “CCPA”), which created new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) including providing consumers a private right of action and receipt of a statutory damages award for a breach of their personal information. The CCPA places significant privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal information of California consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered entities to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. The statutory obligations of CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020. While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and for personal information collected pursuant to certain clinical trial regulations, the CCPA may impact our business depending on how the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. In addition, California recently passed the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”), which goes into effect on January 1, 2023. Pursuant to the CPRA, the CCPA will be amended by creating additional privacy rights for California consumers and additional obligations on businesses, which could subject us to additional compliance costs as well as potential fines, individual claims and commercial liabilities. The uncertainty and rapidity with which the CCPA and CPRA have changed exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal information. Other states in the United States are also beginning to propose laws similar to the CCPA. Some observers have noted that the CCPA and CPRA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Our operations abroad may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from data protection authorities. Many countries in these regions have established or are in the process of establishing privacy laws with which we, our customers, and our vendors must comply. For example, member states of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) have adopted the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) , which came into effect in May 2018 and introduces strict requirements for the processing of personal data of data subjects in the EEA, including clinical trial data. The GDPR has increased compliance burdens on us, including by requiring the following: establishing a legal basis for processing personal data; creating obligations for controllers and processors to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects for controllers (including presentation of certain information in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form about how their personal data is used and their rights vis-à-vis that data and its use); introducing the obligation to carry out so-called data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; establishing limitations on collection and retention of personal data through ‘purpose,’ ‘data minimization’ and ‘storage limitation’ principles; establishing obligations to implement ‘privacy by design’; introducing obligations to honor increased rights for data subjects (such as rights for individuals to be ‘forgotten,’ rights to data portability, rights to object in certain circumstances); formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consent; establishing obligations to implement certain technical and organizational safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data; introducing obligations to agree to certain specific contractual terms and to take certain measures when engaging third party processors and joint controllers; introducing the obligation to provide notice of certain significant security breaches to the relevant 
supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the European Union in certain circumstances. The processing of ‘special categories of personal data’ (such as data concerning health, biometric data used for unique identification purposes and genetic information) imposes further heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and is a topic of active interest among foreign regulators. The GDPR increases our obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in Europe by expressly expanding the definition of personal data to include ‘pseudonymized’ or key-coded data and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial subjects and investigators. The GDPR also provides that EEA member states should make their own further laws and regulations to introduce specific requirements related to the processing of ‘special categories of personal data,’ as well as personal information related to criminal offenses or convictions. This fact may lead to greater divergence on the law that applies to the processing of such data types across the EEA, compliance with which, as and where applicable, may increase our costs and could increase our overall compliance risk. In addition, the GDPR provides for robust regulatory enforcement and greater penalties for noncompliance than previous data protection laws, including fines of up to €20 million or 4 percent of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company for the preceding financial year, whichever is greater. In addition to administrative fines, a wide variety of other potential enforcement powers are available to competent supervisory authorities in respect of potential and suspected violations of the GDPR, including extensive audit and inspection rights, and powers to order temporary or permanent bans on all or some processing of personal information carried out by non-compliant actors. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.
In addition to the above privacy laws that are generally applicable to our business, our physician customers use the HintMD platform to process personal information and PHI. Where we are determined to be a business associate of our physician customers who are covered entities pursuant to HIPAA, the HIPAA security and breach rules would apply directly to our business associate activities. Further, the terms of the business associate agreements we enter into with covered entities would also generally apply parts of the HIPAA privacy rule to our activities. 
The costs of compliance with HIPAA, federal and state privacy laws and breach notification laws, the GDPR and other foreign privacy laws as well as the associated burdens imposed by such non-harmonized laws, may limit the use or adoption of the HintMD platform, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities related to noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we undertake our business or close sales of the HintMD platform, any of which could harm our business. Moreover, if our employees fail to adhere to the company’s processes and practices for the protection and/or appropriate use of personal information or PHI, or in other ways violate privacy laws or breach notification laws, it may damage our reputation and brand. Finally, any failure by our vendors to comply with the terms of our contractual provisions or the applicable privacy laws or breach notification laws, could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.
As our business continues to expand in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and as laws and regulations continue to be passed and their interpretations continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions, additional laws and regulations may become relevant to us. It is possible that the GDPR, CCPA, CRPA, or other laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction or inconsistent with our current policies and practices and compliance with such laws and regulations could require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. We cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all such applicable data protection laws and regulations as they are enforced now or as they evolve.
Security Failures and Breach Notification Laws
 Our internal computer systems, cloud-based computing services and those of our current and any future vendors, collaborators, contractors, or consultants are vulnerable to interruption. Cyberattacks and other malicious internet-based activity continue to increase. In addition to traditional computer “hackers,” malicious code (such as viruses and worms), employee theft or misuse and denial-of-service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors now engage in attacks (including advanced persistent threat intrusions). We cannot guarantee that our or our vendors, collaborators, contractors, or consultants’ security measures will be sufficient to protect against unauthorized access to, or other compromise of, personal information or confidential or proprietary information. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our employees are temporarily working remotely, which may pose additional data security risks. We may also be the subject of phishing attacks, viruses, denial of service attacks, malware installation, server malfunction, software or hardware failures, 
loss of data or other computer assets, adware or other similar issues. While we have security measures in place designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, there can be no assurance that our security measures or those of our third-party service providers that store or otherwise process certain of our and our customers’ data on our behalf will be effective in protecting against unauthorized access to our platform or our or our customers’ information. Our platform, systems, networks, and physical facilities could be breached, or personal information could be otherwise compromised due to employee error or malfeasance, if, for example, third parties attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or our customers to disclose information or user names and/or passwords, or otherwise compromise the security of our platform, networks, systems and/or physical facilities. Third parties may also exploit vulnerabilities in, or obtain unauthorized access to, platforms, systems, networks and/or physical facilities utilized by our vendors.
We are required to comply with laws, rules and regulations that require us to maintain the security of personal information. We may have contractual and other legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. Failure to prevent or mitigate cyber-attacks could result in the unauthorized access to such data, including personal information. In addition to the breach notification obligations under HIPAA, every state in the U.S. now has similar breach notification obligation laws (“breach notification laws”). Breach notification laws vary from state to state but upon an unauthorized disclosure of certain sensitive personal information, generally require notification to data subjects as well as notification in some circumstances to state agencies, such as the state attorneys general or the consumer protection bureau, and in some circumstances, notification to media. Personal information that could trigger a breach notification obligation also differs from state to state, but generally includes the name of the individual in addition to one or more of the following: financial account information, health information, social security number, driver’s license number, and information that could provide access to an account such as an email address and password. 
The costs to respond to a security breach and/or to mitigate any security vulnerabilities that may be identified could be significant, our efforts to address these issues may not be successful, and these issues could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service, negative publicity, loss of customer trust, diminished use of our products and services as well as other harms to our business and our competitive position. Remediation of any potential security breach may involve significant time, resources, and expenses. Any security breach may result in regulatory inquiries, litigation or other investigations, and can affect our financial and operational condition. We may not have adequate insurance coverage for security incidents or breaches, including fines, judgments, settlements, penalties, costs, attorney fees and other impacts that arise out of incidents or breaches. While we maintain general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors or omissions, we cannot assure you that such coverage will be adequate or otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims alleging compromises of personal information or that such coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Our risks are likely to increase as we continue to expand, grow our customer base, and process, store, and transmit increasingly large amounts of proprietary and sensitive data.
Medical Device Distribution
As the distributor of Teoxane’s RHA® Collection of dermal fillers, we are required to maintain certain licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, approvals or other types of state and local permissions in order to comply with various regulations regarding the distribution of medical devices, and we must cooperate with Teoxane in the event of any medical device reports (adverse events) or product recalls. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements may take many months, and may require the expenditure of substantial resources. Failure to comply with such regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions, including the revocation or suspension of licenses, registrations or accreditations, and can also subject us to plans of correction, monitoring, civil monetary penalties, civil injunctive relief and/or criminal penalties. Failure to obtain state regulatory approval will also prevent distribution of products where such approval is necessary and will limit our ability to generate revenue. Maintaining the necessary compliance infrastructure to support these activities will result in increased expense.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Patients in the United States and elsewhere generally rely on third‑party payors to reimburse part or all of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Accordingly, our ability to commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates for therapeutic indications such as cervical dystonia, adult upper limb spasticity will depend in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. As a threshold for coverage and reimbursement, third-party payors generally require that drug products have been approved for marketing by the FDA. Third-party payors also are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical products and services. We may not obtain adequate third-party coverage or reimbursement for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates for therapeutic indications, or we may be required to sell them at a discount.
We expect that third-party payors will consider the efficacy, cost effectiveness and safety of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in determining whether to approve reimbursement for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for therapeutic indications and at what level. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we do not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for therapeutic indications from private insurers on a timely or satisfactory basis. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the U.S.; therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Further, coverage under certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, may not be available for certain of our product candidates. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product candidate does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product candidate. As a result, the coverage determination process will likely be a time-consuming and costly process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
In some foreign countries, particularly Canada and European countries, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies, and so we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our products, including DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, to other available therapies. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control company profits.
Healthcare Reform
The ACA was passed in March 2010, and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and continues to significantly impact the U.S. biotechnology industry. There have been challenges by the executive, judicial and legislative branches of government to certain aspects of the ACA, including some challenges that still remain and intended to delay or prevent the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, which began January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case and held oral arguments on November 10, 2020. It is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. 
In addition, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing 
and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the former U.S. presidential administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. Further, the former U.S. presidential administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has solicited feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, has implemented others under its existing authority. On July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the formal presidential administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration's proposals. The FDA also released a final rule on September 24, 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. The likelihood of implementation of any of the other former U.S. presidential administration's reform initiatives is uncertain, particularly in light of the new presidential administration. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
Payments Regulation 
Numerous laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. The current activities of the HintMD platform do not require it to register as a money services business (“MSB”) or be licensed as a money transmitter or other form of MSB with any U.S. state. However, HintMD may become subject to such regulation in the future as the business continues to grow and evolve, and as the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change. Such a designation, among other things, would subject HintMD to increased operating costs to comply with registration and reporting requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies. The payments industry regulations may also be applicable to Revance as the parent of HintMD. All HintMD platform operations are conducted by certain Revance employees who will be subject to the regulations described in this section. 
HintMD is currently subject to certain payments-related compliance obligations pursuant to its contractual obligations under its payment solutions agreement with MetaBank, National Association and First Data Merchant Services LLC (the “Payment Facilitator Agreement”). These requirements relate to, among other things, operating pursuant to an anti-money laundering policy that is consistent with the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the economic sanctions regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. 
In addition, credit and debit card processing are subject to industry-created and industry specific rules and regulations, including those of Visa Inc. and MasterCard International Inc. (“Rules”). The Rules apply to HintMD because of its contractual obligations pursuant to the Payment Facilitator Agreement. Failure to comply with the Rules can result in termination of the Payment Facilitator Agreement or other key supplier agreements. Changes in the Rules could also mandate material changes in how HintMD solicits new potential clients and fee structures applicable to its agreements with clients, which could result in decreased margins on services of the HintMD platform.
Rules, such as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ("PCI DSS") of the PCI Security Standards Council establish certain security standards applicable to certain participants in payment card processing. Changes in those Rules may impact Hint, Inc.'s ability to collect, store and process card data or the ability of HintMD's suppliers to do the same for HintMD or its clients.
We monitor developments in payments regulations and continue to develop our compliance program based on regulatory trends and changes in our risk profile. 
Environment, Health and Safety
We are voluntarily assessing and publicly reporting our greenhouse gas emissions and water usage, and have begun to take action to reduce such emissions and usage. For example, we have established employee commuter programs, evaluated the energy efficiency of our buildings and installed low-flow water fixtures. Various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the California Air Resources Board is in the process of drafting regulations to meet state emissions targets. Based on current information and subject to the finalization of the proposed regulations, we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs. However, because we are not an energy-intensive business, we do not anticipate being subject to a cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that would likely be material to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
We are also subject to other federal, state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment. We use hazardous materials, chemicals, and various compounds in our research and development activities and cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. Certain misuse or accidents involving these materials could lead to significant litigation, fines and penalties. We have implemented proactive programs to reduce and minimize the risk of hazardous materials incidents.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 470 employees, all of which are located in the U.S. Our employee base grew from 193 as of December 31, 2019, after acquiring HintMD and hiring more than 280 people, including our new field sales force. In addition to our employees, as of December 31, 2020, we engaged 130 independent contractors. As of December 31, 2020, there were no unions represented within our employee base.
We believe that empowered employees make a difference in our ability to execute our strategy. As such, we provide an inclusive, rewarding and engaging environment for employees to develop professionally and contribute to our success. Revance was certified as a Great Place to Work® for the third consecutive year in 2020.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe in equal opportunity employment and do not tolerate discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin/ancestry, age, disability, marital or veteran status. In addition, because we believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, in mid-2020, we formed a Diversity and Inclusion Committee, comprised of employees and led by our Senior Vice President, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary. This committee has a mission to foster diversity, equality and belonging at our workplace. The committee’s mission is supported by consciously learning, educating and empowering our employees to bring awareness to and help dismantle systems of oppression, including systemic racism and overt and unconscious bias, both in the workplace and within our communities. The committee is currently working on developing a comprehensive program to address diversity and inclusion. As a reflection of this commitment, in 2021, we established Company performance goals, which are also included as performance measures in the bonus program for our executive officers, tied to the achievement of specified diversity and inclusion initiatives.
As of December 31, 2020, women represented 56% of our workforce and 32% of our leadership team (defined as management team and executive employees), and ethnic minorities represented 47% of our workforce and 37% of our leadership team.
Training and Talent Development
We believe that our employees are the key to our success, and we believe their development is what supports our growth and prosperity as a company. To support employee development and growth, we offer development training and workshops to all full-time employees. In addition, personal development plans for full-time employees are discussed and reviewed each year with their supervisor. We also offer an education tuition reimbursement program.
Upon joining the company, all new employees are required to become familiar with our policies and complete compliance training, and existing employees are required to acknowledge current policies annually.
Compensation and Benefits
Our objective is to provide our employees with a choice in quality benefits that are competitive and cost-efficient with the flexibility to meet employees’ life needs. Our compensation package includes market-competitive pay, an annual bonus program, an employee stock purchase plan, long-term incentive awards, rewards and recognition opportunities, an education assistance program, health care and retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave, among others. We grant equity to all employees as part of our new hire and annual compensation programs. We are committed to fair wages and benefits for employees at all locations and use appropriate national and local external surveys to provide highly competitive wages and benefits to attract high quality talent. 
Health and Safety
We are committed to the safety of our employees and communities. We provide regular health and safety training programs for employees, which includes, upon on-boarding, an overview during new hire orientation, plus personal protective equipment training, ergonomics evaluation procedures and first aid training. All employees are trained on workplace safety, including security and inspection, work related injuries and emergency protocols. We also conduct special additional training for laboratory staff. 
Also, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly implemented policies to protect our employees and provide solutions to enable our employees to manage their work and personal responsibilities. In addition, a Pandemic Response Team was established, comprised of senior leaders, to help guide and direct activities associated with local governance and business requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
As our business continues to grow and develop, we are focused on building a sustainable enterprise for all of our stakeholders while making a positive impact on the communities in which we serve. As a first step, we have completed our inaugural ESG report which details our commitments and efforts to operate sustainably and responsibly, including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and prevailing social issues in 2020. The report was guided by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework and can be found on the “Corporate Governance” and “Sustainability” sections of our website.
