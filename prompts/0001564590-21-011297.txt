Introduction 
 Ruth’s Hospitality Group, Inc. develops and operates fine dining restaurants under the trade name Ruth’s Chris Steak House. As of December 27, 2020, there were 149 Ruth’s Chris Steak House restaurants, including 74 Company-owned restaurants, three restaurants operating under contractual agreements and 72 franchisee-owned restaurants, including 21 international franchisee-owned restaurants in Aruba, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Singapore and Taiwan. 
 On July 29, 2019, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of three franchisee-owned Ruth’s Chris Steak House restaurants located in Philadelphia, PA, King of Prussia, PA and Garden City, NY (the “MBR Franchise Acquisition”) for a cash purchase price of $18.6 million.  The acquisition was funded with debt through the Company’s senior credit facility.  The results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the MBR Franchise Acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of the acquisition.  For additional information, see Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements.
 The Company has a 52/53-week fiscal year ending the last Sunday in December. Fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 each had 52 weeks. The 2020 fiscal year ended December 27, 2020, the 2019 fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, and the 2018 fiscal year ended December 30, 2018.  
 The following description of the Company’s business should be read in conjunction with the information in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Background 
 Ruth’s Hospitality Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formerly known as Ruth’s Chris Steak House, Inc.  The Company was founded in 1965 when Ruth Fertel mortgaged her home for $22 thousand to purchase “Chris Steak House,” a 60-seat restaurant located near the New Orleans Fair Grounds racetrack. After a fire destroyed the original restaurant, Ruth relocated her restaurant to a new 160-seat facility nearby. As the terms of the original purchase prevented the use of the “Chris Steak House” name at a new restaurant, Ruth added her name to that of the original restaurant—thus creating the “Ruth’s Chris Steak House” brand. 
 The Company’s expansion began in 1972, when Ruth opened a second restaurant in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans. In 1976, the first franchisee-owned Ruth’s Chris Steak House opened in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In 2005, the Company and certain selling shareholders completed an initial public offering of the Company’s common stock, which is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “RUTH”. 
 COVID-19 Impact
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic and the United States declared it a National Public Health Emergency, which has resulted in a significant reduction in revenue at the Company’s restaurants due to mandatory restaurant closures, capacity limitations, social distancing guidelines or other restrictions mandated by governments across the world, including federal, state and local governments in the United States.  As a result of these developments, the Company experienced a significant negative impact on its revenues, results of operations and cash flows.
 For further information on the impact of COVID-19 and actions taken by the Company in response to the pandemic, see Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.
 Ruth’s Chris Steak House 
 With 149 restaurants as of December 27, 2020, Ruth’s Chris Steak House is one of the largest upscale steakhouse companies in the world. The menu features a broad selection of high-quality USDA Prime and Choice grade steaks and other premium offerings served in Ruth’s Chris’ signature fashion —“sizzling”— complemented by other traditional menu items inspired by its New Orleans heritage. Ruth’s Chris complements its distinctive food offerings with an award-winning wine list. 
 1

The Ruth’s Chris brand reflects its 55-year commitment to the core values instilled by its founder, Ruth Fertel, of caring for guests by delivering the highest quality food, beverages and genuine hospitality in a warm and inviting atmosphere. 
 Strengths
 The Company believes that the key strengths of its business model are the following: 
 Premier Upscale Steakhouse Brand
 The Ruth’s Chris Steak House brand is one of the strongest in the upscale steakhouse segment of the restaurant industry, with high levels of brand awareness. The Company has been recognized for its award-winning core wine list, for which a majority of its Company-owned restaurants received “Awards of Excellence” from Wine Spectator magazine.
Appealing Dining Experience 
 At Ruth’s Chris restaurants, the Company seeks to exceed guests’ expectations by offering high-quality food with warm, friendly service. The Company’s entire restaurant staff is dedicated to ensuring that guests enjoy a superior dining experience. The Company’s team-based approach to table service is designed to enhance the frequency of guest contact and speed of service without intruding on the guest experience. Additionally, Ruth’s Chris is recognized by Nation’s Restaurant News as #1 for ambiance, with each location expressing a local influence.
Strategy
 Historically, the Company’s strategy is to deliver a total return to shareholders by maintaining a healthy core business, growing with a disciplined investment approach and returning excess capital to shareholders.  The Company strives to maintain a healthy core business by growing sales through traffic, managing operating margins and leveraging its infrastructure.  In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic and the United States declared it a National Public Health Emergency, which has resulted in us focusing on a shorter-term strategy that preserves liquidity and maximizes restaurant operating income.  Longer-term, the Company intends to return to a balanced strategy that is focused on maintaining a healthy balance sheet and a healthy core business, being disciplined in evaluating future growth opportunities and returning excess capital to shareholders.  While the uncertainty of the virus continues, as more clarity on the return to a “new normal” becomes evident, the Company will evaluate disciplined growth opportunities in markets with attractive sales attributes and solid financial returns.  The Company believes that its franchisee program is a point of competitive differentiation and looks to grow its franchisee-owned restaurant locations as well.  From time to time, the Company may also consider acquiring franchisee-owned restaurants at terms that it believes are beneficial to both the Company and the franchisee.

Expand Relationships with New and Existing Franchisees and Others
 The Company intends to grow its franchising business by expanding the rights of existing franchisees to open new restaurants and potentially developing relationships with a limited number of new franchisees. The Company believes that building relationships with quality franchisees is a cost-effective way to grow and strengthen the Ruth’s Chris brand and generate additional revenues. The Company intends to continue to focus on providing operational guidance to its franchisees, including the sharing of “best practices” from Company-owned Ruth’s Chris restaurants.
 In fiscal year 2020 no new franchisee-owned restaurants were opened.  In fiscal year 2019 one franchisee-owned restaurant opened in Chongquing, China.  In fiscal year 2018 franchisees opened two new restaurants in Ft. Wayne, IN and Markham, Canada.  One new franchisee-owned restaurant is expected to open by the end of fiscal year 2021.
 The Company and its franchise and licensing partners have opened or relocated ten new Ruth’s Chris Steak Houses worldwide during the three-year period ended December 2020.
 Menu
 The Ruth’s Chris menu features a broad selection of high-quality USDA Prime grade steaks and other premium offerings served in Ruth’s Chris signature fashion—“sizzling” on a 500 degree plate and topped with butter and fresh parsley—complemented by other classic American steakhouse menu items. USDA Prime is the highest meat grade level, which refers to the superior quality and evenly distributed marbling that enhances the flavor of the steak. The Ruth’s Chris menu also includes premium quality chicken, crab, fish, lamb chops, lobster and shrimp. 
 The Ruth’s Chris restaurants offer nine standard appetizer items, including New Orleans-style barbequed shrimp, mushrooms stuffed with crabmeat, spicy shrimp, chilled seafood tower and osso bucco ravioli, as well as four to five different salads. Our restaurants also offer a variety of potatoes and vegetables as side dishes. For dessert, crème brûlée, traditional bread pudding with whiskey sauce, chocolate sin cake, cheesecake and other selections are available.  As part of the Company’s response to COVID-19, our restaurants are offering a limited menu to maximize restaurant efficiency and reduce waste.
 The Company’s wine list features bottles typically ranging in price from $46 to over $1,000. Individual restaurants may supplement their 225-bottle core wine list with approximately 20 additional selections that reflect local market tastes. Most of the Company’s Ruth’s Chris restaurants also offer over 17-20 wines-by-the-glass, 10 handcrafted cocktails and numerous beers, premium liquors and alcoholic dessert drinks. 
 Dinner entrees are generally priced from $32 to $99.  Ruth’s Chris is predominately open during dinner hours with only a limited number of restaurants open for lunch.  The lunch menu offers entrees generally ranging in price from $13 to $29.  The blended guest check average at Ruth’s Chris was approximately $82 during fiscal year 2020 with food sales representing 81% of the guest check and the remainder represented by beverage sales.  While the Ruth’s Chris core menu is similar at all of its restaurants, the Company seasonally introduces new items such as limited time and prix fixe offerings that allow it to give its guests additional choices while taking advantage of fresh sourcing and advantageous cost opportunities.
 Restaurant Operations and Management
 The Ruth’s Chris Chief Executive Officer and Vice President of Operations have primary responsibility for managing Company-owned restaurants and participate in analyzing restaurant-level performance and strategic planning. The Company has seven regional vice presidents who oversee restaurant operations at Company-owned restaurants, one vice president to whom the regional vice presidents report and one vice president who has oversight responsibility for franchisee-owned restaurants. In addition, restaurant education and training is overseen by a regional staff dedicated to the ongoing training and development of customer service employees and kitchen staff. 
 A typical Company-owned restaurant employs four managers, including a general manager, two front-of-the-house managers and an executive chef. The Company-owned restaurants also typically have approximately 54 hourly employees. Staffing levels at Company-owned restaurants have been lower in fiscal year 2020 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Purchasing
 The Company’s ability to maintain consistent quality throughout its restaurants depends in part upon its ability to acquire food and other supplies from reliable sources in accordance with its specifications. Purchasing at the restaurant level is directed primarily by the executive chef, who is trained in the Company’s purchasing philosophy and specifications, and who works with regional and corporate managers to ensure consistent sourcing of fish, produce and other supplies.

During fiscal year 2020, the Company purchased substantially all the beef it used in Company-owned Ruth’s Chris restaurants from two vendors, Sysco Specialty Meat Group (a subsidiary of Sysco) and Stock Yards Packing (a subsidiary of US Foods).  Each vendor supplied about half of the Company’s beef requirements.  In addition, the Company has a distribution arrangement with a national food and restaurant supply distributor, Distribution Market Advantage, Inc. (DMA), which purchases products for the Company from various suppliers and through which all the Company-owned Ruth’s Chris Steak House restaurants receive a significant portion of their food supplies. 
 Quality Control 
 The Company strives to maintain quality and consistency in its Company-owned restaurants through careful training and supervision of personnel and standards established for food and beverage preparation, maintenance of facilities and conduct of personnel. The primary goal of the Company’s training and supervision programs is to ensure that its employees display the characteristics of its brand and values that distinguish it from its competitors. Restaurant managers in Company-owned restaurants must complete a training program that is typically seven to eight weeks long, during which they are instructed in multiple areas of restaurant management, including food quality and preparation, guest service, alcoholic beverage service, liquor regulation compliance and employee relations. Restaurant managers also receive operations manuals relating to food and beverage preparation and restaurant operations. Restaurant managers are certified by the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation for food safety.
 In addition to our internal quality control measures, the Ruth’s Chris Steak House restaurants also employ an independent third-party food safety firm to ensure proper training, food safety and the achievement of the highest standards for cleanliness throughout the restaurant through routine quarterly unannounced inspections. The Company instructs chefs and assistants on safety, sanitation, housekeeping, repair and maintenance, product and service specifications, ordering and receiving food products and quality assurance.  At the Ruth’s Chris restaurants, the executive chef, together with the restaurant managers, oversees a line check system of quality control and must complete a quality assurance checklist verifying the flavor, presentation and proper temperature of the food and beverages. 
 Marketing and Promotions
 The goals of the Company’s marketing efforts are to increase restaurant sales by attracting new guests, increasing the frequency of visits by current guests, enhancing the guest experience, driving innovation, improving brand recognition in new markets or markets where it intends to open a restaurant and to communicate the overall uniqueness, value and quality exemplified by the restaurants. The Company uses multiple media channels to accomplish these goals and complements its national advertising with targeted local media such as print, digital media, influencer marketing, search engine marketing, satellite radio and outdoor billboards. 
Advertising
 In fiscal year 2020, the Company spent $6.9 million, or 2.5% of its revenues, in total marketing and advertising expenditures, which included spending on online initiatives, in-store gift card promotion, traditional public relations, social media and influencer marketing. During fiscal year 2020, the Company’s online strategy also included an emphasis on continued website improvement and personalized and targeted emails with special offers and announcements, as well as emails regarding off-premise dining options, holiday offers and personalized birthday and anniversary invitations. In fiscal year 2020, Ruth’s Chris Steak House continued its participation in a co-branded campaign with the American Express Membership Rewards program and the American Express Gold Card partnership. Many of the Company’s restaurants also conduct off-site meal drops for front-line-workers and first responders and schedule events to strengthen community ties and increase local market presence. The Company’s franchisees also conduct their own local media and advertising plans. 
Gift Cards
 The Company sells Ruth’s Chris gift cards at most of its Ruth’s Chris Steak House restaurants, including franchises, on its website and through its toll-free number. E-gift cards, which may be purchased on the Company’s e-commerce gift card website, are emailed directly to the recipient and are redeemable in the same manner as physical gift cards.  Ruth’s Chris gift cards are also sold in third-party retail outlets and are available through redemption of American Express Membership Rewards points.  Offering gift cards at third-party retailers and e-gift cards gives Ruth’s Chris the opportunity to maximize last-minute gift-giving and address its patrons’ requests for convenient, immediate purchases.   Ruth’s Chris patrons frequently purchase gift cards for holidays, including Christmas, Hanukkah, Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day and Father’s Day, and other special occasions.  In fiscal year 2020, Company and franchise sales of Ruth’s Chris gift cards aggregated approximately $49.4 million system-wide, compared to $68.5 million in fiscal year 2019. Ruth’s Chris gift cards are redeemable at both Company and franchisee-owned Ruth’s Chris restaurants.

Franchise Program and Relationship
 Under the Company’s franchise program, the Company offers certain services and licensing rights to the franchisee to help maintain consistency in system-wide operations. The Company’s services include training of personnel, construction assistance, providing the new franchisee with standardized operating procedures and manuals, business and financial forms, consulting with the new franchisee on purchasing and supplies and performing supervisory quality control services. The Company conducts reviews of its franchisee-owned restaurants to ensure compliance with its standards. 
 As of December 27, 2020, the Company’s 72 franchisee-owned Ruth’s Chris restaurants are owned by 25 franchisees with the three largest franchisees owning 32 restaurants in total. 
 Under the Company’s current franchise program, each franchise arrangement consists of a development agreement, if multiple restaurants are to be developed, with a separate franchise agreement executed for each restaurant. The Company’s current form of development agreement grants exclusive rights to a franchisee to develop a minimum number of restaurants in a defined area, typically during a three-to-five-year period. Individual franchise agreements govern the operation of each restaurant opened and have a 20-year term with two renewal options each for additional ten-year terms if certain conditions are met. The Company’s current form of franchise agreement requires franchisees to pay a 5% royalty on gross revenues plus up to a 1% advertising fee applied to national advertising expenditures.  All of the franchisee-owned locations experienced disruptions to their business from COVID-19, and as a result, the Company waived franchise royalty requirements until their dining rooms were re-opened.
 Under the Company’s current form of development agreement, and unless agreed otherwise, the Company collects a $50 thousand development fee, which is credited toward the $150 thousand franchise fee, for each restaurant the franchisee has rights to develop. Under the Company’s current form of the franchise agreement, it collects up to $150 thousand of the full franchise fee at the time of executing the franchise agreement for each restaurant. If one restaurant is to be developed, a single unit franchise agreement is executed and the $150 thousand franchise fee is collected at signing. 
 Information Systems and Restaurant Reporting
 All of the Company’s restaurants use computerized point-of-sale systems, which are designed to promote operating efficiency, provide corporate management timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce restaurant and corporate administrative time and expense. These systems record each order and print the food requests in the kitchen for the cooks to prepare. The data captured for use by operations and corporate management includes gross sales amounts, cash and credit card receipts and quantities of each menu item sold. Sales and receipts information is generally transmitted to the corporate office daily.
 The Company’s corporate systems provide management with operating reports that show Company-owned restaurant performance comparisons with budget and prior year results. These systems allow the Company to monitor Company-owned restaurant sales, food and beverage costs, labor expense and other restaurant trends on a regular basis. 
 Service Marks 
 The Company has registered the main service marks “Ruth’s Chris” and its “Ruth’s Chris Steak House, U.S. Prime & Design” logo, as well as other service marks used by its restaurants, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in the foreign countries in which its restaurants operate. The Company has also registered in other foreign countries in anticipation of new store openings within those countries. The Company is not aware of any infringing uses that could materially affect its business. The Company believes that its service marks are valuable to the operation of its restaurants and are important to its marketing strategy. 
Seasonality 
 The Company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, the percentage of its annual revenues earned during the first and fourth fiscal quarters have been higher relative to other quarters due, in large part, to increased restaurant sales during the year-end holiday season and the popularity of dining out in the fall and winter months. The impact of COVID-19 resulted in higher revenue during the first fiscal quarter of 2020 compared to other quarters which was atypical compared to prior year results. 
Human Capital 
 Our approach to Human Capital is defined by our strong culture of taking care of people, which reflect our roots in the single steak house started by Ruth Fertel over fifty-five years ago, define the essence of Ruth’s Chris Steak House, and determine how we take care of all of Our People: Guests, Team Members, Franchise Owners, Vendor Partners, Community, and Investors.

None of the Company’s employees (our “Team Members”) are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting temporary closures of, or state and local government-imposed capacity restrictions on, our restaurants, many of our hourly Team Members were placed on temporary furlough.  As of December 27, 2020, the Company employed 4,363 persons, of whom 369 were salaried and 3,994 were hourly personnel, who were employed in the positions set forth in the table below. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting temporary closures of our restaurants, many of our hourly Team Members were placed on temporary furlough. As of the end of fiscal year 2020, 1,731 Team Members remained on furlough due to the continuing impacts of the pandemic, including locally mandated closures and capacity restrictions.
 
 
Functional Area | Number of Employees | 
-------------------------------------------------+---------------------+------
Senior Officers / Corporate VPs / Operations VPs | | 21 
General Managers | | 77 
Managers | | 145 
Regional Corporate Chefs / Executive Chefs | | 79 
Non-Salaried Restaurant Staff | | 3,986
Corporate Salaried | | 47 
Corporate Non-salaried | | 8 
Total number of employees | | 4,363

 
We believe the stability of our leadership team is a critical driver of our ability to steward the Company’s brand and to deliver consistently the brand standards and experiences our Guests expect. The average tenure of our Field Leadership (VP Level) is approximately fifteen years, the average tenure of our Restaurant Leadership (General Managers and Chefs) is greater than nine years, and the average tenure of our home office leadership is ten years. In addition, 20% of our General Managers and approximately 25% of our Chefs have been with the company for more than fifteen years, and our Vice President of Operations recently celebrated his 30th anniversary with the Company. 
 Our diverse team reflects our commitment to attracting, retaining, and developing a workforce that reflects the communities in which we live and work.  Across the Company, approximately 59% of our Team Members are racially or ethnically diverse and 33% identify as female.  Of our Named Executive Officers 80% identify as female and 63% of our Board of Directors identify as female. Consistent with our commitment to diversity, we hired a Director of Diversity and Inclusion in November of 2020.  
 We believe that providing competitive benefits to our Team Members is integral to ensuring we achieve our goal of attracting and retaining the best team in the industry. As such, we offer our Team Members competitive pay and health care benefits. Hourly Team Members are eligible for health care and vacation benefits after one year of service if they average 24 hours of work and receive company-paid life insurance when meeting the same criteria. As part of our commitment to our Team Members’ health and well-being during the global pandemic, the Company paid both the Employer and Employee portions of health care premiums for our furloughed Team Members while their restaurants were closed or operating take-out and delivery only through the third quarter of fiscal year 2020.
 Our commitment to our Team Members does not stop with providing competitive pay and benefits. In 2005, following the impact of Hurricane Katrina, we created the RUTHS Fund to support our Team Members experiencing hardship. The RUTHS Fund is supported primarily by home office and field Team Member contributions, and over the course of 2020, the fund paid out $645 thousand in grants, benefiting over 600 of our Team Members who applied for support.
 Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic provided us with the opportunity to reinforce our commitment to the health and safety of our people.  A sample of additional steps we are taking to keep our Team Members and guests safe include: increased sanitation processes, enhanced COVID-19 safety training and certification of our hourly and management team, voluntary capacity restrictions in select markets to protect our Team Members and guests, and daily health screenings of all restaurant Team Members. The impact of this increased vigilance was an average weekly exclusion rate (the number of Team Members excluded from work divided by the total number of Team Members working) of less than 1% over the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020. 
 Government Regulation
 The Company is subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulation, including regulations relating to public health and safety, zoning and fire codes and the sale of alcoholic beverages and food. The Company maintains the necessary restaurant, alcoholic beverage and retail licenses, permits and approvals. Federal and state laws govern the Company’s relationship with its employees, including laws relating to minimum wage requirements, overtime, tips, tip credits and working conditions. A significant number of the Company’s hourly employees are paid at rates related to federal or state minimum wage. During 2020, governmental entities acted to increase minimum wage rates in several jurisdictions where Company-owned restaurants are located.

The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. The Company is subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie, fat, trans fat, salt and allergen content. Beginning in May 2018, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“ACA”) has required restaurant companies, such as the Company, to disclose calorie information on their menus. The Food and Drug Administration has rules to implement this provision that require restaurants to post the number of calories for most items on menus or menu boards and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request. A number of states, counties and cities have also enacted menu labeling laws requiring restaurant companies, such as the Company, to disclose certain nutrition information on their menus, or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants some of which are preempted by the federal law.  Many of the current requirements are inconsistent or are interpreted differently from one jurisdiction to another. The long-term effect of such labeling requirements on consumer choices, if any, is unclear at this time.
The Company maintains an employee benefits program that provides self-insured and insured coverage to employees that meet the applicable requirements under the program. Employees can elect to enroll dependents that meet eligibility criteria. Coverage includes health, dental, vision, short- and long-term disability, life insurance and other voluntary ancillary benefits. Employees share in the cost of other coverage at varying levels. The Company has historically funded a majority of the cost of employee health benefits. The ACA requires that employers offer health care coverage that is qualified and affordable. Coverage must be offered to all “full-time” employees, as defined by the ACA. The Company routinely reviews its health benefit plans to assure conformity with the ACA. The hours of service eligibility criteria the Company requires for health benefits are lower than required under the ACA. Approximately 68% of eligible employees elect to participate in the Company’s health benefit plans. 
 The offer and sale of franchises are subject to regulation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and many states. The FTC requires that the Company furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document containing prescribed information. A number of states also regulate the sale of franchises and require state registration of franchise offerings and the delivery of a franchise disclosure document to prospective franchisees. The Company’s noncompliance could result in governmental enforcement actions seeking a civil or criminal penalty, rescission of a franchise, and loss of its ability to offer and sell franchises in a state, or a private lawsuit seeking rescission, damages and legal fees. 
 Competition 
 The restaurant business is highly competitive and highly fragmented, and the number, size and strength of the Company’s competitors vary widely by region. The Company believes that restaurant competition is based on, among other things, quality of food products, customer service, reputation, restaurant location, atmosphere, name recognition and price. The Company’s restaurants compete with a number of upscale steakhouses within their markets, both locally owned restaurants and restaurants within regional or national chains. The principal upscale steakhouses with which the Company competes are Fleming’s, The Capital Grille, Smith & Wollensky, The Palm, Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse, Fogo de Chão, Morton’s The Steakhouse, Eddie V’s and other local fine dining restaurants. The Company’s competitors may be better established in certain of the Company’s existing markets and/or markets into which the Company intends to expand.
