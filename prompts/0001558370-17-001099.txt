     ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
     Overview
     Since its founding in 1952, Nabors has grown from a small land drilling business in Canada to one of the world’s largest drilling contractors. Nabors Industries, Ltd. (NYSE: NBR) was formed as a Bermuda exempted company on December 11, 2001. Today, Nabors owns and operates the world’s largest land-based drilling rig fleet and are a leading provider of offshore platform drilling rigs in the United States and multiple international markets. Nabors also provides advanced wellbore placement services, drilling software and performance tools, drilling equipment and innovative technologies throughout the world’s most significant oil and gas markets. In today’s performance-driven environment, we believe we are well positioned to seamlessly integrate downhole hardware, surface equipment and software solutions into our AC rig designs. Leveraging our advanced drilling automation capabilities, Nabors’ highly skilled workforce continues to set new standards for operational excellence and transform our industry.
     Our Drilling & Rig Services business is comprised of our global land-based and offshore drilling rig operations and other rig services, consisting of equipment manufacturing, rig instrumentation and optimization software. We also specialize in wellbore placement solutions and are a leading provider of directional drilling and measurement while drilling (“MWD”) systems and services. Our Drilling & Rig Services business consists of four reportable operating segments: U.S., Canada, International and Rig Services.
     As a global provider of drilling and drilling-related services for land-based and offshore oil and natural gas wells, our fleet of rigs and drilling-related equipment as of December 31, 2016 includes:
    
· | 400 actively marketed rigs for land-based drilling operations in the United States, Canada and approximately 20 other countries throughout the world; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 41 actively marketed rigs for offshore drilling operations in the United States and multiple international markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We experienced a reduction in the number of rigs working during 2015 and into early 2016 due to low oil and natural gas prices which caused a decrease in exploration and production spending. Oil prices reached lows in early 2016 and have since begun to rebound and producers have responded by beginning to increase activity. The following table presents our average rigs working (a measure of activity and utilization over the year) and average utilization for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:
    
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 
 | Average | Average | Average | Average | Average | Average 
 | Rigs Working | Utilization | Rigs Working | Utilization | Rigs Working | Utilization
U.S. | 62.0 | 24% | 120.0 | 41% | 212.5 | 68% 
Canada | 9.7 | 14% | 16.7 | 25% | 34.1 | 50%

      Additional information regarding the geographic markets in which we operate and our business segments can be found in Note 21—Segment Information in Part II, Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
     U.S. Drilling
     Our U.S. Drilling operations include land drilling activities in the lower 48 states and Alaska as well as offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico. We operate one of the largest land-based drilling rig fleets in the United States, consisting of 184 AC rigs and 33 SCR rigs which were actively marketed as of December 31, 2016. 
     Nabors’ first AC land rig was built during 2002. Since then, the technology has significantly evolved as more than 900 AC rigs have been added to the U.S. land market. As the industry shifted to multi well pad drilling, operators demanded greater efficiencies and adaptability through batch drilling. We believe our latest generation of PACE® 

 
  4

 
drilling rigs are ideal for batch drilling, with pad optimal features, such as our unique side saddle design, and advanced walking capabilities. 
     In 2013, we introduced our PACE®-X800 rig with an advanced walking system that enables the rig to move quickly over existing wells, along the X and Y axes. Most of the ancillary equipment moves with the rig, enabling it to move easily between adjacent rows of wells. Through December 31, 2016, we have placed a total of 44 PACE®-X800 rigs into service within the lower 48 market, including four rigs during fiscal year 2016. 
     During the second half of 2016, we introduced our new PACE®-M800 and PACE®-M1000 rigs which complements our existing PACE®-X800 rigs. The PACE®-M800 rig is designed for lower-density multi-well pads whereas the PACE®-M1000 is designed for higher density pads. Both are designed to move rapidly between pads. Featuring the same advanced walking capabilities as the PACE®-X800 rig, the PACE®-M800 rig can quickly move efficiently on pads and over short distances, with minimal rig-up and rig-down components. As of December 31, 2016, we have placed four PACE®-M800 rigs into service.
     In addition to land drilling operations throughout the lower 48 states and Alaska, we also actively marketed 17 platform rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as of December 31, 2016. 
     Our U.S. drilling operations contributed approximately 25% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately 33% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015.
     International Drilling
     We maintain a footprint in nearly every major oil and gas market across the globe, most notably in Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Colombia, Venezuela and Russia. Many of our rigs in our international drilling markets were designed to address the challenges inherent in specific drilling locations such as those required in the desert and remote or environmentally sensitive locations, as well as the various shale plays. As of December 31, 2016, our fleet consisted of 135 land-based drilling rigs in approximately 20 countries. We also actively marketed 18 platforms and six jackup rigs in the international offshore drilling markets as of the same date. We continue to upgrade and deploy high-specification desert rigs specifically for gas drilling in the Middle East. We have been able to extend the utilization of the PACE®-X800 rigs in international markets by deploying six such rigs in Latin America. 
     On October 31, 2016, we entered into an agreement with Saudi Arabian Development Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saudi Arabian Oil Company (“Saudi Aramco”), to form a new joint venture to own, manage and operate onshore drilling rigs in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The joint venture, which will be equally owned by Saudi Aramco and Nabors, is anticipated to be formed and commence operations in the second half of 2017. The joint venture will leverage our established business in Saudi Arabia to begin operations, with a focus on Saudi Arabia's existing and future onshore oil and gas fields. Saudi Aramco and Nabors will each contribute land rigs to the joint venture in the first years of operation along with capital commitments toward future onshore drilling rigs which will be manufactured in Saudi Arabia. 
     Our International drilling operations contributed approximately 68% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately 48% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
     Canada Drilling
     Our rig fleet consisted of 47 land-based drilling rigs in Canada as of December 31, 2016. Our Canada drilling operations contributed approximately 2% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately 4% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015.     Rig Services
     In order to advance today’s drilling technology and move toward complete drilling automation, we believe it is critical to create a holistic environment of integrated hardware and software. The breadth of our operations provides a competitive advantage because we design integrated drilling rigs, software and equipment. Our new modular 

 
  5

 
RigtelligentTM operating control system automates many repetitive drilling and wellbore placement tasks. The integration of data from both downhole tools and surface systems enables us to provide innovative drilling solutions to our customers, reducing the need for third-party contractors. We focus on creating and advancing our innovative technologies through our Rig Services segment, which includes Canrig and Nabors Drilling Solutions. 
     Drilling Equipment
     Through Canrig, we manufacture and sell top drives, catwalks, wrenches, drawworks and other drilling related equipment which are installed on both onshore and offshore drilling rigs.      Drilling Performance Tools and Advanced Wellbore Placement Technologies
     Through Nabors Drilling Solutions, we offer specialized drilling technologies, such as patented steering systems and rig instrumentation software systems that enhance drilling performance and wellbore placement. These products include:

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our Rig Services operations contributed approximately 5% of our consolidated operating revenues, net of intercompany sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately 6% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015.
     Our Business Strategy
    
Our business strategy is to build shareholder value and enhance our competitive position by:
    
· | achieving superior operational and health, safety and environmental performance;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | leveraging our existing global infrastructure and operating reputation to capitalize on growth opportunities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
 
  6

 


· | continuing to develop our existing portfolio of value-added services to our customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | enhancing our technology position and advancing drilling technology both on the rig and downhole; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | achieving returns above our cost of capital.
--+---------------------------------------------

      During 2016, we made significant progress in expanding our technology portfolio. All of our new-build rigs have been deployed with our new RigtelligentTM modular-code operating system and we have commenced retrofitting most of our AC fleet.  We believe these actions position us well to address the changing market dynamic both in the United States and internationally. Our technological development efforts are focused on advanced rig designs with emphasis on automation of the drilling floor, a suite of downhole measurement and sensing tools and the seamless integration of the rig’s operations with downhole sensing. In addition, we are adding complementary services to our traditional rig offering and in many cases replacing third-party providers of these complementary services as a single service provider. These efforts support our strategy to differentiate our drilling services, and ultimately reduce our customers’ unit costs, through advanced drilling technology and value added enhancements.
     Additionally, in the Lower 48 market, we commenced the formal rollout of a suite of related services — including wellbore placement, performance drilling tools, managed pressure drilling services, and other services — which complement our core drilling activities. We believe these services represent an opportunity to increase our revenue per rig, and since our rig crews provide the services, our incremental cost is generally lower than the costs incurred by existing third-party service providers.
     We also introduced our new PACE®-M800 rig in the second half of 2016, designed for optimal well construction with minimal time spent mobilizing between well pads.  Customers have been very receptive to this new rig, with each rig receiving a contract prior to completion of construction, and all the rigs have achieved 100% utilization through December 31, 2016.  These new rigs complement our existing pad-optimal PACE®-X rigs, which also operate at near-100% utilization as of the end of 2016. 
     Drilling Contracts
     Our drilling contracts are typically daywork contracts. A daywork contract generally provides for a basic rate per day when drilling (the dayrate for providing a rig and crew) and for lower rates when the rig is moving between drilling locations, or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control. In addition, daywork contracts may provide for a lump-sum fee for the mobilization and demobilization of the rig, which in most cases approximates our anticipated costs. A daywork contract differs from a footage contract (in which the drilling contractor is paid on the basis of a rate per foot drilled) and a turnkey contract (in which the drilling contractor is paid for drilling a well to a specified depth for a fixed price).
     Our contracts for land-based and offshore drilling have durations that are single-well, multi-well or term. Term contracts generally have durations ranging from six months to five years. Under term contracts, our rigs are committed to one customer. Offshore workover projects are often contracted on a single-well basis. We generally receive drilling contracts through competitive bidding, although we occasionally enter into contracts by direct negotiation. Most of our single-well contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice, while multi-well contracts and term contracts may provide us with early termination compensation in certain circumstances. Such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract, and in certain circumstances the customer may not be obligated, able or willing to make an early termination payment to us. Contract terms and rates differ depending on a variety of factors, including competitive conditions, the geographical area, the geological formation to be drilled, the equipment and services to be supplied, the on-site drilling conditions and the anticipated duration of the work to be performed. In addition, throughout 2015 and 2016, we experienced downward pricing-pressure for our drilling services from existing customers in light of the industry conditions and, as a result, renegotiated pricing and other terms in our drilling contracts with certain customers. See Part I, Item 1A.—Risk Factors— Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows, profitability and ability to retain skilled employees and Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment.
     Our Customers
     Our customers include major national and independent oil and gas companies. One customer, Saudi Aramco, accounted for approximately 33% and 12% of our consolidated operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 

 
  7

 
2016 and 2015, respectively, and is included in our International drilling operating segment. The increase from 2015 to 2016 was primarily as a result of our acquisition of the remaining interest in Nabors Arabia Company Limited (“Nabors Arabia”), our joint venture in Saudi Arabia, in May 2015 and our consolidation of Nabors Arabia’s results of operations. Nabors Arabia was historically a joint venture in the Kingdom, which now is wholly-owned by Nabors. Our contracts with Saudi Aramco are on a per rig basis. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014. As mentioned previously, we have entered into a new joint venture agreement with this customer.
     Our Employees
     As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 13,000 people in approximately 20 countries. Our number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services. Some rig-based employees in Alaska, Argentina, Mexico and Australia are represented by collective bargaining units. We believe our relationship with our employees is generally good.     Seasonality
     Our operations are subject to seasonal factors. Specifically, our drilling operations in Canada and Alaska generally experience reduced levels of activity and financial results during the second quarter of each year, due to the annual spring thaw. In addition, our U.S. offshore market can be impacted during summer months by tropical weather systems in the Gulf of Mexico. Global climate change could lengthen these periods of reduced activity, but we cannot currently estimate to what degree. Our overall financial results reflect the seasonal variations experienced in these operations, but seasonality does not materially impact the remaining portions of our business.     Research and Engineering
     Research and engineering continues to be an important part of our overall business. During 2016, we spent approximately $33.6 million on research and engineering activities. The effective use of technology is critical to maintaining our competitive position within the drilling industry. We expect to continue developing technology internally and/or acquiring technology through strategic acquisitions.
     Industry/Competitive Conditions
     To a large degree, our businesses depend on the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. The level of exploration, development and production activities is to a large extent tied to the prices of oil and natural gas, which can fluctuate significantly and are highly volatile. Since the second half of 2014, the oil and gas industry has experienced a significant decline as a result of decreasing oil and natural gas prices, resulting in a reduction of exploration, development and production activities of our customers. The level of activity in the sector remained suppressed throughout 2016 and into 2017. A continued decrease or further prolonged decline in the price of oil or natural gas or in the exploration, development and production activities of our customers could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services and/or a reduction in dayrates and utilization, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1A.—Risk Factors— Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows, profitability and ability to retain skilled employees and Item 7.— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
     The markets in which we provide our services are highly competitive. We provide our drilling and rig services in the United States, Canada and approximately 20 other countries throughout the world. We believe that competitive pricing is a significant factor in determining which service provider is awarded a job in these markets and customers are increasingly sensitive to pricing during periods of market instability. Historically, the number of available rigs and drilling-related equipment has exceeded demand in many of the markets in which we operate, resulting in strong price competition. This is due in part to the fact that most rigs and drilling-related equipment can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in the levels of exploration, development and production activities and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas.
     In late 2014, falling oil prices forced a curtailment of drilling-related expenditures by many companies and resulted in an oversupply of rigs in the markets where we operate. This reduction in drilling and related activity impacted our key markets through both 2015 and 2016. Although many rigs can be readily moved from one region to another in 

 
  8

 
response to changes in levels of activity and many of the total available contracts are currently awarded on a bid basis, competition has increased based on the supply of existing and new rigs across all of our markets. Most available contracts for our services are currently awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price.
     In addition to price, other competitive factors in the markets we serve are the overall quality of service and safety record, the technical specification and condition of equipment, the availability of skilled personnel and the ability to offer ancillary services. Our drilling business is subject to certain additional competitive factors. For example, our ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features and, in certain international markets, our experience operating in certain environments and strong customer relationships have been significant factors in the selection of Nabors for the provision of drilling services. We expect that the market for our drilling services will continue to be highly competitive. See Part I, Item 1A.—Risk Factors—We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
     Certain competitors are present in more than one of the markets in which we operate, although no one competitor operates in all such markets. We compete with (1) Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. and several other competitors with national, regional or local rig operations in the United States, (2) Saipem S.p.A, KCA Deutag, and Weatherford International Ltd. and various contractors in our international markets and (3) Precision Drilling, Ensign Energy Services, and others in Canada.
     Acquisitions and Divestitures
     We have grown from a land drilling business centered in the U.S. lower 48 states, Canada and Alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in most of the major oil and gas markets in the world. At the beginning of 1990, our fleet consisted of 44 actively marketed land drilling rigs in Canada, Alaska and in various international markets. Today, our worldwide fleet of actively marketed rigs consists of 400 land drilling rigs, 35 offshore platform rigs and 6 jackup units. This growth was fueled in part by strategic acquisitions. While we continuously consider and review strategic opportunities, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, alliances and other strategic transactions, there can be no assurance that such opportunities will continue to be available, that the pricing will be economical or that we will be successful in completing and realizing the expected benefits of such transactions in the future.
     We may sell a subsidiary or group of assets outside of our core markets or business if it is strategically or economically advantageous for us to do so.
     On March 24, 2015, we completed the merger (the “Merger”) of our Completion & Production Services business with C&J Energy Services, Inc. (“C&J Energy”). In the Merger and related transactions, our wholly-owned interest in our Completion & Production Services business was exchanged for cash and an equity interest in the combined entity, C&J Energy Services Ltd. (“CJES”). Prior to the Merger, our Completion & Production Services business conducted our operations involved in the completion, life-of-well maintenance and plugging and abandonment of wells in the United States and Canada. On July 20, 2016, CJES and certain of its subsidiaries commenced voluntarily cases under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. For more information on the accounting for our investment in CJES, see Note 9—Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates in Part II, Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. On December 12, 2016, we entered into a mediated settlement agreement with various other parties in the CJES bankruptcy proceedings and on January 6, 2017, CJES announced it had emerged from bankruptcy. See further discussion in Item 3.—Legal Proceedings.
     In addition to the Merger, we undertook the following strategic transactions over the last three years.
     Acquisitions
     In October 2014, we purchased the outstanding shares of 2TD Drilling AS (“2TD”), a drilling technology company based out of Norway. 2TD is in the process of developing a rotary steerable system for directional drilling which, once developed, will be included in our Rig Services operating segment. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid an initial amount of $40.3 million for the purchase of the shares. We may also be required to make future payments contingent on the achievement of various milestone objectives. As of December 31, 2016, these future payments are estimated to be $13.9 million.
    
 
  9

 

 In May 2015, we paid $106.0 million in cash to acquire the remaining 49% equity interest in Nabors Arabia, our prior joint venture in Saudi Arabia, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. Previously, we held a 51% equity interest with a carrying value of $44.7 million, and we had accounted for the joint venture as an equity method investment. The acquisition of the remaining interest allows us to strategically align our future growth in this market by providing additional flexibility to invest capital and pursue future investment opportunities. As a result, we consolidated the assets and liabilities of Nabors Arabia on the acquisition date based on their respective fair values. We have also consolidated the operating results of Nabors Arabia since the acquisition date and reported those results in our International drilling segment. 
     Divestitures
     In 2014, we sold a large portion of our interest in our oil and gas proved properties located on the North Slope of Alaska. Under the terms of the agreement, we received $35.1 million at closing and expected to receive additional payments of $27.0 million upon certain future dates or the properties achieving certain production targets. During 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $22.4 million to reserve for these future amounts payable to Nabors and our retained interest in these properties.  We retained a working interest in the properties at various interests.  The working interest is fully carried up to $600 million of total project costs.
     See Note 4—Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations for additional discussion in Part II, Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
     Environmental Compliance
     We do not anticipate that compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and controls will significantly change our competitive position, capital spending or earnings during 2017. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental rules and regulations and that the cost of such compliance is not material to our business or financial condition. For a more detailed description of the environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, see Part I, Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Changes to or noncompliance with governmental laws and regulations or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.
