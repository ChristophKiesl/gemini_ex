ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Introduction
Edify Acquisition Corp. (“EAC” or the “Company”) a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on September 30, 2020 formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination or our business combination. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, we intend to focus our search on businesses in education, edtech, workforce development, and HCM sectors in the United States.
On January 20, 2021, EAC consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 27,600,000 units (the “Units”), each Unit consisting of one share of common stock of EAC, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The closing included the full exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to EAC of $276,000,000.
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, EAC consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with Colbeck Edify Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”) of 5,640,000 warrants (the “Private Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $5,640,000. The Private Warrants are identical to the Warrants (as defined below) sold in the IPO except that the Private Warrants will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the Sponsor, the anchor investors or their permitted transferees. Additionally, our Sponsor and anchor investors have agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Private Warrants or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until the date that is 30 days after the date we complete our initial business combination. Our Sponsor and anchor investors were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Warrants.
As of January 20, 2021, a total of $276,000,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of EAC’s public stockholders at Morgan Stanley maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to (i) pay our tax obligations or (ii) for working capital purposes (but not to exceed $250,000 annually) (less up to $100,000 interest to pay dissolution expenses), the amounts in trust will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (a) the completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by January 21, 2023 or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination by January 21, 2023, subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of our creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of our public stockholders.
Merger Agreement
On December 18, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Edify Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Unique Logistics International, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Unique Logistics”).
The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the Nevada Revised Statutes (the “NRS”) and other applicable laws, Merger Sub will merge with and into Unique Logistics (the “Merger”), with Unique Logistics being the surviving corporation of the Merger (Unique Logistics, in its capacity as the surviving corporation of the Merger, the “Surviving Corporation”) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

The proposed Merger is expected to be consummated after receipt of the required approvals from the stockholders of the Company and Unique Logistics and the satisfaction of certain other conditions summarized below.
Closing Merger Consideration
At the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Unique Logistics (“Unique Logistics’ Common Stock”) (other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) will be cancelled and automatically deemed for all purposes to represent the right to receive a number of shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Buyer (“Buyer Class A Common Stock”) equal to the quotient of (i) the Per Share Consideration Value (as defined herein), divided by (ii) $10.00 (subject to equitable adjustment) (the “Common Exchange Ratio”). The “Per Share Consideration Value” equals the quotient of (i) $282 million, divided by (ii) the sum of (A) the number of shares of Unique Logistics’ Common Stock, plus (B) the number of shares of Unique Logistics’ Common Stock into which all of the shares of Unique Logistics’ convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Unique Logistics (collectively, the “Unique Logistics’ Convertible Preferred Stock”) would convert, in each case, as of immediately prior to the Merger, taking into account the effects of the Transactions in accordance with the certificate of designations applicable to such Unique Logistics’ Convertible Preferred Stock.
At the effective time of the Merger:

● | each share of Unique Logistics’ Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) will be cancelled and automatically deemed for all purposes to represent the right to receive a number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Unique Logistics’ Common Stock into which such share of Unique Logistics’ Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible, taking into account the effects of the Transactions in accordance with the certificate of designation applicable to such Unique Logistics’ Convertible Preferred Stock, and (ii) the Common Exchange Ratio;

● | each share of Unique Logistics’ Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) will be cancelled and automatically deemed for all purposes to represent the right to receive a number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Unique Logistics’ Common Stock into which such share of Company Series D Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible, taking into account the effects of the Transactions in accordance with the certificate of designation applicable to such Unique Logistics’ Convertible Preferred Stock, and (ii) the Common Exchange Ratio.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unique Logistics’ stockholders will also have the opportunity to earn up to 1,250,000 additional shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock if (i) the trading price of Company’s Class A Common Stock exceeds $12.00 per share during the seven-year period following the date that is sixty days after the date of the closing (the “Closing”) of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Transactions”) or (ii) the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries’ consummate a merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer or business combination or sale of all or substantially all of its assets (each, a “Sale Transaction”), in which the fair value of the consideration (including all forms of consideration, including contingent consideration) payable in respect of each outstanding share of Company’s Class A Common Stock in such Sale Transaction equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (on a fully diluted basis), subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Company stockholders will also have the opportunity

to earn 1,250,000 additional shares of Company’s Class A Common Stock if the trading price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock exceeds $15.00 per share in the same circumstances as above.
Sponsor Support Agreement
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Colbeck Edify Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”) entered into an amended and restated letter agreement with the Company, Unique Logistics and certain directors and officers of the Company pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed: (i) to waive certain anti-dilution rights that may have otherwise entitled the Sponsor to more than one share of the Company’s Class A Common Stock per share upon conversion of the Sponsor’s founder shares on a one-to-one basis into shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the Merger; (ii) to forfeit 1,713,139 of its founder shares contingent upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iii) to support the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including agreeing to vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting; (iv) not to transfer founder shares or private placement warrants between the date of the Merger Agreement and the Closing; and (v) contingent upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, not to transfer any shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (or shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof), or any warrant entitling the Sponsor to purchase one share of the Company’s Class A Common Stock per warrant, in each case, for a period of 12 months following the date of the Closing subject to potential early termination if the trading price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock trades above $12.00 per share for a period specified therein.
For additional information, refer to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, as filed with the SEC on December 19, 2022.
Extensions and Redemptions 
On December 21, 2022, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). On December 6, 2022, the record date for the Special Meeting, there were 34,500,000 issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, 82.84% of which were represented in person or by proxy. The stockholders voted on a proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to allow the Company to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from January 20, 2023 (the date that is 24 months from the closing date of the Company’s IPO to April 20, 2023 (the date that is 27 months from the closing date of the IPO) (the “Amended Date”) and on a monthly basis up to three times from the Amended Date to July 20, 2023 (the date that is 30 months from the closing date of the IPO).The stockholders also voted on a proposal amend the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated January 14, 2021 (the “Trust Agreement”), by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Trustee”), to allow the Company to (A) extend the date on which the Trustee must liquidate the trust account established by the Company in connection with the IPO if the Company has not completed its initial business combination from January 20, 2023 (the date that is 24 months from the closing date of the IPO) to April 20, 2023 (the date that is 27 months from the closing date of the IPO) by depositing the lesser of (a) $225,000 and (b) $0.15 into the trust account for each public share that has not been redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Company’s charter for such three month extension, and (B) further extend the Combination Period on a monthly basis up to three times from the Amended Date to July 20, 2023 (the date that is 30 months from the closing date of the IPO) by depositing the lesser of (a) $75,000 and (b) $0.05 into the trust account for each public share that has not been redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Company’s charter for each subsequent one-month extension. Each of the proposals described above was approved by the Company’s stockholders. The Company’s stockholders elected to redeem an aggregate 25,912,336 shares of Common Stock in connection with the Special Meeting. On January 18, 2023, the Company deposited $225,000 into the trust account in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement. As of April 10, 2023, the Company’s trust account balance was $17,664,687.86.
Redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our initial business combination
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes and/or to fund our working capital requirements, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account was initially $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with 

4



us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares held by them and any public shares they may acquire during or after the initial public offering in connection with the completion of our initial business combination or otherwise.
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer.
The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirements. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules.
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon.
Whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on Nasdaq, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares by one of the two methods listed above. Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. 

5



If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will:

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote any founder shares held by them and any public shares purchased by them during or after the initial public offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. 
We intend to give prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our sponsor, officers and directors, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically. We believe that this will allow our transfer agent to efficiently process any redemptions without the need for further communication or action from the redeeming public stockholders, which could delay redemptions and result in additional administrative cost. If the proposed initial business combination is not approved and we continue to search for a target company, we will promptly return any certificates delivered, or shares tendered electronically, by public stockholders who elected to redeem their shares.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed initial business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed initial business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.

Limitation on redemption rights of stockholders holding 15% or more of the shares sold in this offering if we hold stockholder vote
Pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering, without our prior consent. We believe the restriction described above discourages stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against an initial business combination if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those stockholders that hold more than 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering) for or against our initial business combination.
Conflicts of Interest
Each of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present the opportunity to such entity, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.
Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.

Employees
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
