--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our key product outside the United States is:
 

· | Microcyn® or Microdacyn60® (sold under a variety of brand names), a line of products based on electrically charged oxychlorine small molecules designed to target a wide range of pathogens including viruses, fungi, spores and bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As of May 30, 2017, we have obtained 16 clearances from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, that permit us to sell our products as medical devices for Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the United States.
 
Outside the United Sates, we sell products for dermatological and advanced tissue care with a European Conformity marking (known as Conformité Européenne or CE) covering 25 of our products, and various approvals in China, Southeast Asia, South Korea, India, Australia, New Zealand, and the Middle East.
 
On October 27, 2016, we, along with our Mexican subsidiary and manufacturer Oculus Technologies of Mexico, S.A. de C.V., closed on an asset purchase agreement with Invekra, S.A.P.I de C.V., an affiliate of Laboratorios Sanfer S.A. de C.V., for the sale of certain of our Latin America assets. Specifically, we agreed to sell certain patents, patent applications, trademarks and territory rights for Mexico, the Caribbean and South America, excluding the sale of dermatology products in Brazil, as well as to build and deliver equipment that Invekra will use to produce its own product.
 
The aggregate purchase price that Invekra paid for the assets is $22,000,000, of which $18,000,000 was paid upon closing, $1,500,000 was held in escrow until completion of our obligation to deliver certain equipment and paid to us on March 16, 2017. $2,500,000 is to be paid in Mexican currency in quarterly installments over a period of ten years from closing as consideration for the provision of certain services and providing technical assistance, calculated as three per cent on net sales of certain products in Latin America, excluding Mexico. Since the $2,500,000 is to be paid in foreign currency, we may receive more or less than $2,500,000 due to currency fluctuations.

We believe that the sale of the Latin America assets is in line with our overall strategy to focus on our core dermatology business and generate cash from our non-core businesses to support the higher margin and higher-growth dermatology business. As a result of the sale of our Latin America assets, we expect our Latin America revenues will decrease and our total revenues will decrease in the short-term until our U.S. based dermatology revenues increase longer-term. We believe focusing on higher margin dermatology products, utilizing an internal sales force, allows us to better control and grow our future results rather than relying on external partners for marketing and sales. We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the Latin America assets to increase our direct sales force and grow our product line and continue to expand our markets and Company.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our strategy is to in-license, acquire, develop and commercialize unique, affordable and differentiated therapies that we believe advance the standard of care for patients with dermatological diseases. The key components of our strategy are to:

· | Expand our Internal U.S. Sales Force: We continue to hire additional experienced sales people who have established relationships with dermatologists in their territories and we currently have a sales force of 36 sales professionals. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop and Launch New Dermatology Products: We currently sell nine prescription dermatology products in the United States, and have a strong product pipeline of new products, including an oral antibiotic for severe acne and Ceramax™, which utilizes a “state of the art” skin repair technology. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In-License and Acquire New Product Candidates: Since beginning our turn-around strategy in 2013, we have executed multiple transactions resulting in adding new products and product candidates to our growing portfolio. In 2015, we acquired the U.S. marketing rights to Mondoxyne™, an oral antibiotic indicated for severe acne. In 2016, we in-licensed Ceramax™ indicated for various dermatoses, and Loyon indicated as a descaler of various dermatoses and psoriasis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Create a Competitive Pricing Strategy: We have and will continue to develop a unique product pricing strategy, which we believe solves many of the challenges associated with the prescription dermatology market’s current pricing and rebate programs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop a Pharmaceutical Line: We plan to acquire or develop pharmaceutical products with affordable clinical trials to increase our market presence and create innovator patent protection.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our plan is to evolve into a leading dermatology company, providing innovative and cost-effective solutions to patients, while generating strong, consistent revenue growth and maximizing long-term shareholder value.
 
Our Products
 
In the United States some of our key dermatology products are:
 
Celacyn® – Prescription Scar Management Gel
 

Celacyn®, is a prescription hypochlorous acid based scar management gel designed to soften and flatten raised scars while reducing redness and discoloration. In our studies, Celacyn® has been shown to reduce scar itch pain and performed better than the market-leading comparable gel brand. In the United States, topical prescription scar treatment products are usually sold over the counter. By contrast, we actively market Celacyn® to clinicians. Scars are a natural part of the healing process and a reaction to skin injury. Scars form when the dermis, or the lower level of the skin, is damaged and then repaired by a process called granulation, where the body produces collagen fibers to repair the damage. Celacyn® works on keloid and hypertrophic scars. Keloid scars continue to grow after the skin has healed which causes the scars to grow beyond the originally damaged area. Hypertrophic scars are marked by excessive scar tissue in a local area and appear thick, red and lumpy. Celacyn® scar gel is intended for the management of old and new scars resulting from burns, general surgical procedures and trauma wounds.

Ceramax™ – Skin Barrier Cream
 

Ceramax™ Skin Barrier Cream helps manage dry itchy skin, minor skin irritations, rashes, and inflammation caused by various skin conditions based on patented Lipogrid® Technology. Ceramax™ Skin Barrier Cream can be used to treat a variety of disease states with skin barrier disruption, including eczema and atopic dermatitis. According to the National Eczema Association, eczema or atopic dermatitis affects over 10% of the children in the United States and one out of every three children with eczema or atopic dermatitis have moderate to severe symptoms. Additionally, 31.6 million people have some form of eczema with approximately 17.8 million of those having moderate to severe eczema or atopic dermatitis. Ceramax™ Skin Barrier Cream is intended to be used as a topical skincare preparation to relieve and manage the burning and itching associated with various skin conditions, including atopic dermatitis, and other dry skin conditions, by maintaining a moist wound and skin environment. Lipogrid® Technology contains lipids that blend in with the skin’s natural lipid building blocks to hydrate and restore the natural skin barrier and penetrate the skin.

Mondoxyne™ – Prescription Oral Antibiotic
 

Mondoxyne™ is a prescription oral tetracycline antibiotic that contains doxycycline, a broad spectrum antibacterial synthetically derived from oxytertracycline, used as a treatment for acne vulgaris. According to the British Association of Dermatologists, acne vulgaris is estimated to affect 660 million people, or 9.4% of the global population, and it is the eighth most common disease worldwide. Acne is thought to have multiple contributing factors, including, among other things, excess sebum, or oil, production, which creates an optimal environment for the proliferation of the bacterium Propionibacterium acnes. The Propionibacterium acnes bacteria feed on the sebum and secrete enzymes and other byproducts that irritate the skin and result in the inflammation commonly known as acne. Mondoxyne™ is an oral antibiotic that can be effective against acne because of its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity. It is usually prescribed as adjunct therapy for severe inflammatory acne. Mondoxyne™ treats acne by targeting the bacterium Propionibacterium acnes. Patients have rated doxycycline, the active ingredient in Mondoxyne™, as effective or very effective in 85% of cases, as reported by a 1989 double-blind study published in the Journal of Dermatological Treatment comparing the effectiveness of doxycycline and minocycline in the treatment of moderate to moderately severe acne.

Alevicyn™ SG Antipruritic Spray Gel, Dermal Spray and Antipruritic Gel
 

Alevicyn™ is indicated to manage and relieve the burning, itching and pain experienced with various types of skin conditions, including radiation dermatitis and atopic dermatitis. It may be also used to relieve the pain of first- and second-degree burns, and helps to relieve dry waxy skin by maintaining a moist wound and skin environment, which is beneficial to the healing process. Alevicyn™ Antipruritic Gel is intended for management of itch and pain associated with dermal irritations and wounds, such as sores, injuries and ulcers of dermal tissue. Alevicyn™ Antipruritic Spray gel’s unique formulation is a “spray-on” that does not run or drip after application and no “rubbing-in” is required on sensitive or difficult-to-access areas of the body. Alevicyn™ dermal spray is intended for the cleansing, irrigation, moistening, debridement and removal of foreign material including microorganisms and debris from wounds, among others, first- and second-degree bums, abrasions, minor irritations of the skin, diabetic foot ulcers, and ingrown toe nails.

SebuDerm™ Topical Gel
 

SebuDerm™ Topical Gel is indicated to manage and relieve the burning, stinging, erythema, scaling and pain experienced with various types of dermatoses, including seborrhea and seborrheic dermatitis. Our studies have shown that SebuDerm™ improves skin appearance and relieves itching, burning and stinging significantly without adverse side effects. SebuDerm™ is based on our own patented Microcyn® Technology, specifically for body areas where seborrheic dermatitis is present, such as the scalp, beard area, behind the ears, chest or nasal areas. Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic or relapsing form of eczema or dermatitis that mainly affects the sebu-rich areas of the scalp, trunk and face. It affects 1-3% of the general population and 34-83% in immune-compromised persons. It is more common in men and is typically more severe in cold and dry climates and during periods of increased stress.

Microcyn® -Advanced Tissue Care Management
 

Microcyn® is based on electrically charged oxychlorine small molecules designed to target a wide range of pathogens including viruses, fungi, spores and bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains. Several Microcyn® Technology advanced tissue care products are designed to treat infections and enhance healing while reducing the need for antibiotics. When a wound is slow to heal or becomes hard to heal, the costs to treat increase and the quality of life for the patient also suffers as infected, malodorous wounds prevent them from participating in daily life activities. As a result of our patented manufacturing process, Microcyn® is a proprietary solution of oxychlorine compounds that, among other things, interacts with and inactivates surface proteins on cell walls and membranes of microorganisms. The functions of these proteins are varied and play significant roles in cell communication, nutrient and waste transport and other required functions for cell viability.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Once Microcyn® surrounds single cell microorganisms, it damages these proteins, causing the cell membrane to rupture, leading to cell death, which we believe is caused by increased membrane permeability and induced osmotic pressure imbalance. This destruction of the cell appears to occur through a fundamentally different process than that which occurs as a result of contact with a bleach-based solution because experiments have demonstrated that Microcyn® kills bleach-resistant bacteria. However, we believe the solution remains non-irritating to human tissues because human cells have unique protective mechanisms, are interlocked, and prevent Microcyn® from targeting and surrounding single cells topically on the body. Laboratory tests suggest that our solution does not penetrate and kill multi-cellular organisms, and does not damage or affect human DNA.
 
In laboratory tests, Microcyn® has been shown to destroy certain biofilms. A biofilm is a complex cluster of microorganisms or bacteria marked by the formation of a protective shell, allowing the bacteria to collect and proliferate. It is estimated that over 65% of microbial infections in the body involve bacteria growing as a biofilm. Bacteria living in a biofilm typically have significantly different properties from free-floating bacteria of the same species. One result of this film environment is increased resistance to antibiotics and to the body’s immune system. In chronic wounds, biofilms interfere with the normal healing process and halt or slow wound closure. Bacteria growing in biofilms can become up to 1000-fold more resistant to antibiotics and other biocides as compared to their planktonic, or free floating, counterparts. As a result, biofilm infections cannot be effectively treated with conventional antibiotic therapy.  In our laboratory studies, Microcyn® was shown to destroy two common biofilms after five minutes of exposure.
 
In published studies, Microcyn® has been shown to significantly increase the dilation of capillaries in wounds as indicated by higher levels of oxygen at a wound site after the application of our product and also to reduce inflammation by inhibiting certain inflammatory responses from allergy-producing mast cells. It is widely accepted that reducing chronic inflammation surrounding an injury or wound is beneficial to wound healing. Our laboratory research suggests that Microcyn®’s interference with these cells is selective to only the inflammatory response and does not interfere with other functions of these cells. Microcyn® Technology has demonstrated antimicrobial activity against numerous bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains, as evidenced by passing results in numerous standardized laboratory microbiology tests conducted on our 510(k) approved technology by a variety of certified independent testing laboratories.
 
Regulatory Approvals and Clearances
 
To date, we have obtained 16 clearances from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, that permit us to sell our products as medical devices for Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the United States.

Domestic Sales and Marketing
 
Dermatology
 
In the United States, we sell into dermatology markets through our division, IntraDerm™ Pharmaceuticals, staffed with a seasoned management and growing sales team. Our dermatology products are primarily purchased by distributors and wholesalers, pharmacies and dermatologist.
 
Although specific customer requirements can vary depending on applications, customers generally demand quality, innovation, affordability and clinically-supported efficacy. We have responded to these customer demands by introducing new products focused on these requirements in the markets we serve. Specifically, we believe that we introduce new products and applications that are innovative, address the specific dermatological procedures in demand, and supported by human clinical data. In addition, we provide attractive product line extensions and pricing to new product families. In the future, to increase market penetration in addition to marketing to our core dermatologists, we may also market our products to aesthetic dermatologists and plastic surgeons.
 
We seek to establish strong ongoing relationships with our customers through new products, sales of existing products, ongoing training and support, and distributing skincare products. We primarily target our marketing efforts to practitioners through office visits, workshops, trade shows, webinars and trade journals. We also market to potential patients through brochures, workshops and our website. In addition, we offer clinical forums with recognized expert panelists to promote advanced treatment
 
Advanced Tissue Care and Animal Health Care
 
We sell into the advanced tissue care markets with our dedicated in-house sales force and through our call center. We also enter into strategic partnerships with physicians and surgeons to promote our products. Our tissue care products are primarily purchased by hospitals, physicians, nurses, and other healthcare practitioners, who are the primary caregivers to patients, both human and animal, being treated for acute or chronic wounds or undergoing surgical procedures.
 
For our animal health care products we partner with Manna Pro Products, LLC which distributes products to all farm animal specialty stores, farm animal veterinarians in the United States and Canada, and distributors to farm animal specialty stores and farm animal veterinarians in the United States and Canada, and non-prescription animal care products to grocery stores and mass retailers in the United States and Canada.

On October 27, 2016, we, along with our Mexican subsidiary and manufacturer Oculus Technologies of Mexico, S.A. de C.V., closed on an asset purchase agreement with Invekra, S.A.P.I de C.V., an affiliate of Laboratorios Sanfer S.A. de C.V., for the sale of certain of our Latin America assets. Specifically, we agreed to sell certain patents, patent applications, trademarks and territory rights for Mexico, the Caribbean and South America, excluding the sale of dermatology products in Brazil, as well as to build and deliver equipment that Invekra will use to produce its own product.
 
The aggregate purchase price that Invekra paid for the assets is $22,000,000, of which $18,000,000 was paid upon closing, $1,500,000 was held in escrow until completion of our obligation to deliver certain equipment and paid to us on March 16, 2017. $2,500,000 is to be paid in Mexican currency in quarterly installments over a period of ten years from closing as consideration for the provision of certain services and providing technical assistance, calculated as three per cent on net sales of certain products in Latin America, excluding Mexico. Since the $2,500,000 is to be paid in foreign currency, we may receive more or less than $2,500,000 due to currency fluctuations.
 
As a result of the asset purchase agreement and arrangement, we expect our revenues in Latin America will decrease significantly. Pursuant to the arrangement, going forward we will receive a royalty of 3% on all Latin American net revenues (outside of Mexico), with a minimum payment of $250,000 per year for the next ten years, to be paid quarterly in Mexican pesos. Due to currency fluctuations, we may not receive the full $250,000 in U.S. dollars. Additionally, while Invekra sets up their manufacturing, we will continue to supply Invekra with product at a reduced price.

Our machines are subjected to a series of tests, which is part of a validation protocol mandated by U.S., Mexican and international Current Good Manufacturing Practices, Quality Systems Regulation, and ISO requirements. This validation is designed to ensure that the final product is consistently manufactured in accordance with product specifications at all manufacturing sites. Certain materials and components used in manufacturing our machines are proprietary to us.
 
We believe we have a sufficient number of machines to produce an adequate amount of Microcyn® to meet anticipated future requirements for at least the next two years. As we expand into new geographic markets, we may establish additional manufacturing facilities to better serve those new markets.

Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product technology and know-how, to operate without infringing proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing, when possible, U.S. and foreign patent applications relating to our technology, inventions and improvements that are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
As of June 6, 2017, we own a total of 63 issued patents, consisting of 13 issued U.S. patents and 50 issued foreign patents. We also have 33 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. All our patent applications as well as the issued patents are directed at our Microcyn® Technology. The issued U.S. and foreign patents expire in 2022-2029.
 
In addition to our own patents and applications, we have licensed technology developed in Japan relating to an electrolyzed water solution, methods of manufacture and electrolytic cell designs. This license includes four issued Japanese patents.
 
Although we work diligently to protect our technology, we can make no assurances that any patent will be issued from our currently pending patent applications or from future patent applications. The scope of any patent protection may not exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to us, and any of our patents may not be held valid if subsequently challenged, and others may claim rights in or ownership of our patents and proprietary rights. Furthermore, others may develop products similar to our products and may duplicate any of our products or design around our patents.
 
We have also filed for trademark protection for marks used with our Microcyn® products in each of the following regions: United States, Europe, Canada, certain countries in Central and South America, including Mexico and Brazil, certain countries in the Middle East and certain countries in Asia, including Japan, China, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, India and Australia. In addition to patents and trademarks, we rely on trade secret and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights. We believe that in order to have a competitive advantage, we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. We also require our employees, consultants and advisors with whom we expect to work on our products to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions made in the course of our working relationship with them, while using our property or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to wrongfully obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary.
 
Competition
 
Dermatology
 
The dermatology market is highly competitive. Our dermatology products face competition in the United States from several prescription products including Novartis’ Elidel® Cream, a prescription medicine used topically on the skin to treat eczema, which is also called atopic dermatitis, and Astellas’ Protopic®, a prescription ointment used to treat moderate to severe eczema. In addition, topical steroids are commonly used to treat inflammation and itch on atopic dermatitis patients as the standard of care. Many doctors and patients tend to use topical steroids for a limited time period to manage flare-ups due to their side effects.
Advanced Tissue Care Markets
 
Competition in the markets for advanced tissue care is intense. We compete with a number of large, well-established and well-funded companies that sell a broad range of wound and tissue care products, including topical anti-infectives and antibiotics, as well as some advanced wound technologies, such as skin substitutes, growth factors and sophisticated delayed release silver-based dressings.
Factors Affecting Our Competitive Position
 
While many companies are able to produce oxychlorine formulations, their products, unlike ours, typically become unstable after a relatively short period of time or use very large ranges of effectiveness to improve their shelf lives. We believe Microcyn® is a stable anti-infective therapeutic available, or soon to be available, throughout many parts of the world that treats infection while also enhancing wound healing through increased blood flow to the wound bed and reduction of inflammation.

Research and Development
 
Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel expenses, clinical and regulatory services and supplies. For the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, research and development expense amounted to $1,576,000 and $1,806,000, respectively. None of these expenses were borne by our customers.
Significant Customers
 
We rely on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. At March 31, 2017, one customer represented 26%, one customer represented 22%, one customer represented 18%, and one customer represented 17% of the net accounts receivable balance. At March 31, 2017, one customer represented 12%, one customer represented 11%, and one customer represented 10% of net revenues. At March 31, 2016, one customer represented 33% of the net accounts receivable balance. At March 31, 2016, one customer represented 40%, one customer represented 15%, one customer represented 14% and two customers each represented 12% of net revenues.
Our Employees
 
As of March 31, 2017, we employed a total of 75 employees in the United States and the Netherlands. Additionally, we had 138 employees in Mexico, all of which were contracted through an employment agency. As of March 31, 2017, we had a U.S. direct sales force of 30 employees, 2 district managers, and 3 senior managers. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local levels and foreign countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, sampling, marketing, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, biologics and medical devices. All of our products in development will require regulatory approval or clearance by government agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous pre-clinical and clinical trials and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries. Various federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations also govern testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, distribution and record-keeping related to such products and their marketing. The process of obtaining these approvals and clearances, and the subsequent process of maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In addition, statutes, rules, regulations and policies may change and new legislation or regulations may be issued that could delay such approvals.
Medical Device Regulation
 
To date, we have received sixteen 510(k) clearances for use of our Microcyn® technology products as medical devices in tissue care management, such as cleaning, debridement, lubricating, moistening and dressing, including for acute and chronic wounds, and in dermatology applications. Any future product candidates or new applications using Microcyn® that are classified as medical devices will require clearance by the FDA.
 
Medical devices, such as Microcyn® Wound Care, are subject to FDA clearance and extensive regulation under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, medical devices are classified into one of three classes: Class I, Class II or Class III. The classification of a device into one of these three classes generally depends on the degree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices may also be designated unclassified. Unclassified devices are legally marketed pre-amendment devices for which a classification regulation has yet to be finalized and for which a pre-market approval is not required.

Class I devices are devices for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to a set of general controls. These general controls include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, which sets forth good manufacturing practice requirements; facility registration, device listing and product reporting of adverse medical events; truthful and non-misleading labeling; and promotion of the device only for its cleared or approved intended uses. Class II devices are also subject to these general controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is typically accomplished through the 510(k) pre-market notification procedure. When 510(k) clearance is sought, a sponsor must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device. If the FDA agrees that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, then 510(k) clearance to market will be granted. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a pre-market approval.
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a pre-market approval application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) pre-market notification. These trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption. An investigational device exemption must be supported by pre-clinical data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, which show that the device is safe to test in humans and that the study protocols are scientifically sound. The FDA must approve an investigational device exemption, in advance, for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and is eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements.
 
Both before and after a medical device is commercially distributed, manufacturers and marketers of the device have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Device manufacturers are subject to periodic and unannounced inspection by the FDA for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, which sets forth the Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, servicing, labeling, storage, installation and distribution of all finished medical devices intended for human use.
 
FDA regulations prohibit the advertising and promotion of a medical device for any use outside the scope of a 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval or for unsupported safety or effectiveness claims. Although the FDA does not regulate physicians’ practice of medicine, the FDA does regulate manufacturer communications with respect to off-label use.
 
If the FDA finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply with FDA laws and regulations or that a medical device is ineffective or poses an unreasonable health risk, it can institute or seek a wide variety of enforcement actions and remedies, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe actions such as:
 

· | imposing fines, injunctions and civil penalties;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | requiring a recall or seizure of products;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | implementing operating restrictions, which can include a partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval approvals already granted; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 
The FDA also has the authority to require a company to repair, replace, or refund the cost of any medical device.
 
The FDA also administers certain controls over the export of medical devices from the United States, as international sales of medical devices that have not received FDA clearance are subject to FDA export requirements. Additionally, each foreign country subjects such medical devices to its own regulatory requirements. In the European Union, there is a single regulatory approval process and approval is represented by the presence of a CE Mark.

Other Regulation in the United States
 
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act
 
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act signed into law in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act requires manufacturers of medical devices, drugs, biologicals, and medical supplies to track and report certain payments made to and transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as to report certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. These manufacturers must report annually to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services any direct or indirect payments and transfers of value of $10 or more, or annual aggregate of $100 or more, made to physicians or to a third party at the request of or on behalf of a physician, including dentists. Payment includes: consulting fees, compensation for services other than consulting, honoraria, gifts, entertainment, food, travel (including the specified destinations), education, research, charitable contribution, royalty or license, current or prospective ownership or investment interest, direct compensation for serving as faculty or as a speaker for a medical education program, grants, any other nature of the payment, or other transfer of value. Manufacturers face monetary penalties for non-compliance. Certain payments related to research must be reported separately. Product samples intended for patient use need not be reported.
Health Care Coverage and Reimbursement by Third-Party Payors
 
Commercial success in marketing and selling our products depends, in part, on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party health care payors, such as government and private health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services. Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United States. These changes are causing the marketplace to be more cost-conscious and focused on the delivery of more cost-effective medical products. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies, and managed-care plans control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or treatments. This has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers for our products. Some third-party payors also require that a favorable coverage determination be made for new or innovative medical devices or therapies before they will provide reimbursement of those medical devices or therapies. Even though a new medical product may have been cleared or approved for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the product until adequate coverage and reimbursement have been obtained from governmental and other third-party payors.
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
In the United States, we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, which, among other things, prohibit the offer or acceptance of remuneration intended to induce or in exchange for the purchase of products or services reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and the submission of false or fraudulent claims with the government. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act and comparable state laws. These laws regulate the activities of entities involved in the healthcare industry, such as us, by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements such entities may have with healthcare providers who use or recommend the use of medical products, including, for example, sales and marketing programs, advisory boards and research and educational grants. In addition, in order to ensure that healthcare entities comply with healthcare laws, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that healthcare entities institute effective compliance programs. To assist in the development of effective compliance programs, the Office of Inspector General has issued model Compliance Program Guidance, materials for a variety of healthcare entities which, among other things, identify practices to avoid that may implicate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and other relevant laws and describes elements of an effective compliance program. While compliance with the Compliance Program Guidance materials is voluntary, a California law requires pharmaceutical and devices manufacturers to initiate compliance programs that incorporate the Compliance Program Guidance and the July 2002 Pharmaceuticals Research and Manufacturers of America Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals.
 
Due to the scope and breadth of the provisions of some of these laws, it is possible that some of our practices might be challenged by the government under one or more of these laws in the future. Violations of these laws, which are discussed more fully below, can lead to civil and criminal penalties, damages, imprisonment, fines, exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any such violations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Anti-Kickback Laws
 
Our operations are subject to federal and state anti-kickback laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual for a good or service reimbursed under a federal healthcare program, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, waiver of co-payments, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Because the Anti-Kickback Statute makes illegal a wide variety of common, even beneficial, business arrangements, the Office of Inspector General was tasked with issuing regulations, commonly known as “safe harbors,” that describe arrangements where the risk of illegal remuneration is minimal. As long as all of the requirements of a particular safe harbor are strictly met, the entity engaging in that activity will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the Office of Inspector General. Our agreements to pay compensation to our advisory board members and physicians who provide other services for us may be subject to challenge to the extent they do not fall within relevant safe harbors under state and federal anti-kickback laws. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which apply to the referral of patients for health care services reimbursed by Medicaid, and some have adopted such laws with respect to private insurance. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are subject to significant fines and penalties and may lead to a company being excluded from participating in federal health care programs.
 
False Claims Laws
 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly filing a false claim, knowingly causing the filing of a false claim, or knowingly using false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Certain violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitute per se violations of the False Claims Act. Under the False Claims Act, such suits are known as “qui tam” actions. Individuals may file suit on behalf of the government and share in any amounts received by the government pursuant to a settlement. In addition, certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, where the federal government created financial incentives for states to enact false claims laws consistent with the federal False Claims Act. As more states enact such laws, we expect the number of qui tam lawsuits to increase. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend false claims actions, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state government healthcare programs as a result of investigations arising out of such actions.
HIPAA
 
Two federal crimes were created under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
Health Information Privacy and Security
 
Individually, identifiable health information is subject to an array of federal and state regulation. Federal rules promulgated pursuant to HIPAA regulate the use and disclosure of health information by “covered entities.” Covered entities include individual and institutional health care providers from which we may receive individually identifiable health information. These regulations govern, among other things, the use and disclosure of health information for research purposes, and require the covered entity to obtain the written authorization of the individual before using or disclosing health information for research. Failure of the covered entity to obtain such authorization could subject the covered entity to civil and criminal penalties. We may experience delays and complex negotiations as we deal with each entity’s differing interpretation of the regulations and what is required for compliance. Also, where our customers or contractors are covered entities, including hospitals, universities, physicians or clinics, we may be required by the HIPAA regulations to enter into “business associate” agreements that subject us to certain privacy and security requirements. In addition, many states have laws that apply to the use and disclosure of health information, and these laws could also affect the manner in which we conduct our research and other aspects of our business. Such state laws are not preempted by the federal privacy law when such laws afford greater privacy protection to the individual than the federal law. While activities to assure compliance with health information privacy laws are a routine business practice, we are unable to predict the extent to which our resources may be diverted in the event of an investigation or enforcement action with respect to such laws.
Foreign Regulation
 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the applicable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement also vary greatly from country to country. Although governed by the applicable country, clinical trials conducted outside of the United States typically are administered under a three-phase sequential process similar to that discussed above for medical devices.

European Union Regulation
 
Medical Device Regulation
 
Our products are classified as medical devices in the European Union. In order to sell our medical device products within the European Union, we are required to comply with the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive, and its national implementations, including affixing CE markings on our products. The CE marking indicates a product’s compliance with EU legislation and so enables the sale of products throughout the European Economic Area, or the EEA, comprising the 28 Member States of the EU and European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, countries Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein. In order to comply with the Medical Devices Directive, we must meet certain requirements relating to the safety and performance of our products and, prior to marketing our products, we must successfully undergo verification of our products’ regulatory compliance, or conformity assessment.
 
On May 26, 2017, the new Medical Devices Directive became effective in the EEA, becoming fully applicable after a transition period of three years, on May 26, 2020. Under the new Medical Devices Directive, certain devices will be classified in higher classes, new devices will become classified, and certain new obligations are imposed on manufacturers and distributors. Manufacturers will be required to engage a medical device expert and carry insurance for possible liability claims. In addition, the pre-market approval and post-market surveillance requirements were enhanced. The European Database for Medical Devices, or Eudamed, will hold and publish information on medical devices collected from the European Commission and the national authorities.
 
Medical devices are divided into three regulatory classes: Class I, Class IIB and Class III. The nature of the conformity assessment procedures depends on the regulatory class of the product. In order to comply with the examination, we completed, among other things, a risk analysis and presented clinical data, which demonstrated that our products met the performance specifications claimed by us, provided sufficient evidence of adequate assessment of unwanted side effects and demonstrated that the benefits to the patient outweigh the risks associated with the device. We are subject to continued supervision and are required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities. We are also required to comply with additional national requirements that are beyond the scope of the Medical Devices Directive.
 
We received a CE certificate for 25 of our Class IIB medical devices, which allows us to affix CE markings on these products and sell them in Europe. We may not be able to maintain the requirements established for CE markings for any or all of our products or be able to produce these products in a timely and profitable manner while complying with the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive and other regulatory requirements.
 
Marketing Authorizations for Drugs
 
In order to obtain marketing approval of any of our drug products in Europe, we must submit for review an application similar to a U.S. new drug application to the relevant authority. In contrast to the United States, where the FDA is the only authority that administers and approves new drug applications, in Europe there are multiple authorities that administer and approve these applications. Marketing Authorizations in Europe expire after five years but may be renewed.
 
We believe that any drug candidate will be reviewed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, on behalf of the European Medicines Agency. Based upon the review of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, the European Medicines Agency provides an opinion to the European Commission on the safety, quality and efficacy of the drug. The decision to grant or refuse an authorization is made by the European Commission.
 
Approval of Marketing Applications can take several months to several years, or may be denied. This approval process can be affected by many of the same factors relating to safety, quality and efficacy as in the approval process for new drug applications in the United States. As in the United States, European drug regulatory authorities can require us to perform additional non-clinical studies and clinical trials. The need for such studies or trials, if imposed, may delay marketing approval and involve unanticipated costs. Inspection of clinical investigation sites by a competent authority may also be required as part of the regulatory approval procedure. In addition, as a condition of marketing approval, regulatory agencies in Europe may require post-marketing surveillance to monitor for adverse effects, or other additional studies may be required as deemed appropriate. The terms of any approval, including labeling content, may be more restrictive than expected and could affect the marketability of a product. In addition, after approval for the initial indication, further clinical studies are usually necessary to gain approval for any additional indications.
 
European Good Manufacturing Process
 
In the European Union, the manufacture of pharmaceutical products and clinical trial supplies is subject to good manufacturing practice as set forth in the relevant laws and guidelines. Compliance with good manufacturing practice is generally assessed by the competent regulatory authorities. They may conduct inspections of relevant facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each drug manufacturing facility must be approved. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product.

Mexican Regulation
 
The Ministry of Health is the authority in charge of sanitary controls in Mexico. Sanitary controls are a group of practices related to the orientation, education, testing, verification and application of security measures and sanctions exercised by the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health is responsible for the issuance of Official Mexican Standards and specifications for drugs subject to the provisions of the General Health Law, which govern the process and specifications of drugs, including the obtaining, preparing, manufacturing, maintaining, mixing, conditioning, packaging, handling, transporting, distributing, storing and supplying of products to the public at large. In addition, a medical device is defined as a device that may contain antiseptics or germicides used in surgical practice or in the treatment of continuity solutions, skin injuries or its attachments.
 
Under the General Health Law, a business that manufactures drugs is either required to obtain a “Sanitary Authorization” or to file an “Operating Notice.” Our Mexico subsidiary, Oculus Technologies of Mexico, S.A. de C.V., is considered a business that manufactures medical devices and therefore is not subject to a Sanitary Authorization, but rather only to file an Operating Notice.
 
In addition to its Operating Notice, our Mexico subsidiary has obtained a “Good Processing Practices Certificate” issued by Mexican Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks, which demonstrates that the manufacturing of Microcyn® at the facility located in Zapopan, Mexico, operates in accordance with the applicable official standards.
 
In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the United States, which could result in lengthy negotiations delaying our ability to commercialize our products. We face the risk that the prices which result from the regulatory approval process would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return.
