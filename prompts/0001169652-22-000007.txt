ITEM 1. BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
We are a leading provider of cloud-based e-commerce solutions whose mission is to connect and optimize the world's commerce. For over two decades, we have helped brands and retailers worldwide to streamline their e-commerce operations, expand to new channels and grow their sales. Our multichannel commerce platform allows our customers to connect to hundreds of global channels, market to consumers on those channels, sell products, manage fulfillment processes, and analyze and optimize channel performance. Thousands of customers depend on us to securely power their e-commerce operations on channels such as Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Shopify, Walmart and Zalando. Our platform helps global brands gain a competitive advantage with actionable insights into digital shelf performance across thousands of retailer websites and marketplaces and helps make digital campaigns shoppable. Overall, our platform provides the breadth, scalability and flexibility to facilitate billions of dollars in e-commerce transactions annually across the globe. 
We serve customers across a wide range of industries and geographies. Our customers include the online businesses of brands and retailers, as well as advertising agencies that use our solutions on behalf of their clients.
E-commerce has grown steadily over the last two decades, as consumers have increasingly shifted their retail purchases from traditional brick-and-mortar stores to online stores and marketplaces. In the last two years, this growth accelerated due to the global novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic. Growth in e-commerce has been due to a number of factors, including:
•availability and ease of accessing a broader selection of merchandise online;
•consumer convenience and safety, as well as ease of use;
•more competitive and transparent pricing;
•increased functionality and reliability of e-commerce websites;
•convenience and speed of order fulfillment;
•broad use of mobile connected devices for e-commerce; and
•proliferation of specialized websites and online distribution channels.
As a result of these factors, consumers today have more options than ever before to discover, research and purchase products online.
While these e-commerce growth drivers create significant opportunities for brands and retailers, they also create additional complexity and challenges. Brands and retailers seeking new avenues to expand their online sales must manage product data and transactions across hundreds of highly fragmented online channels where data attributes vary, requirements change frequently and the pace of innovation is rapid and increasing. With speed of order fulfillment becoming increasingly strategic to winning business, brands and retailers often interface with multiple fulfillment service providers, each with different technological capabilities and communication requirements. Many larger brands also seek to manage and nurture traditional retail relationships along with direct-to-consumer channels.
OUR MARKET OPPORTUNITY
 We believe that the addressable market for our enterprise software-as-a-service, or SaaS, solutions is large, growing and under-penetrated, especially with brands customers. Our technology helps brands as well as retailers navigate the evolving e-commerce landscape and enables them to integrate, manage and optimize their merchandise sales across these disparate online channels. In addition, we facilitate improved collaboration between brands and their authorized resellers through solutions that deliver high value leads from brands to those resellers. We generate the majority of our revenue from our customers' usage of our SaaS solutions, which are organized into modules. Each module integrates with a particular type of channel, such as third-party marketplaces, digital marketing websites and authorized reseller websites. Using our solutions, customers can:
•connect with new channels and more easily integrate with channels they already use;
•access online sources of consumer demand, such as marketplaces and social networks;
•adapt to the frequently changing policies and requirements of each channel;
•manage real-time inventory allocation and availability across channels;
•implement dynamic pricing and promotion strategies across channels;
•efficiently manage, evaluate and optimize customer traffic to their own e-commerce websites;
•connect to fulfillment and logistics providers on a global scale;
•more easily sell into new geographic territories worldwide;
•provide a seamless consumer journey from brand websites and digital marketing campaigns to the e-commerce sites and physical stores of authorized resellers;
•reduce dependence on in-house information technology staff and avoid significant up-front capital expenses; and
•access in real-time the latest product and software upgrades that we regularly release on our SaaS platform to keep up with the rapid pace of change and innovation in the market.
We derive our revenue primarily from subscription fees paid to us by our customers for usage of our platform for a specified contract term, which is usually one year. The majority of our subscription fee is based on the amount of a customer's GMV processed on our platform. Our subscription fee may also be based on the amount of advertising spend processed on our platform. A portion of the GMV-based or advertising spend-based subscription fee is based on a specified minimum amount of GMV or advertising spend that a customer expects to process through our platform. The remaining portion of GMV-based or advertising spend-based fee is typically variable and is based on a specified percentage of GMV or advertising spend processed through our platform that exceeded the customer's specified minimum GMV or advertising spend amount. We believe that our pricing model aligns our interests with those of our customers. We also receive implementation fees, which may include fees for providing launch assistance and training.
INDUSTRY BACKGROUND
Increasing complexity and fragmentation for brands and retailers selling online
E-commerce is a large and global market that continues to expand as brands and retailers continue to increase their online sales. However, it is also an increasingly complex and fragmented market due to the hundreds of channels available to brands and retailers and the rapid pace of change and innovation across those channels. Historically, a brand or retailer might have simply established an online storefront and used a basic paid search program to drive traffic to its website. Today, in order to gain consumers' attention in a more crowded and competitive online marketplace, an increasing number of brands and many retailers sell their merchandise through multiple online channels, each with its own rules, requirements and specifications. In addition, brands and retailers often seek to sell their products in multiple countries, each with its own local consumer preferences and behaviors.
Several significant trends have contributed to this increasing complexity and fragmentation, including:
•Increase in brands' participation in direct-to-consumer e-commerce. With the continued success of Amazon and the struggles of some traditional retail partners, more brands are exploring or participating in direct-to-consumer online sales using their own websites and/or third-party marketplaces. The shift to direct-to-consumer online sales is forcing brands to enhance their logistics and fulfillment capabilities compared to the traditional brick-and-mortar retail model. However, because those traditional retail partners may still represent a majority of revenue for many brands, brands typically desire solutions that allow collaboration with those partners in addition to direct-to-consumer solutions.
•Emergence and growth of online third-party marketplaces.    Third-party marketplaces, which are marketplaces that aggregate many sellers, are an increasingly important driver of growth for a number of large online retailers. Some of these marketplaces, such as Amazon, offer products from their own inventory, known as first-party products, as well as products sold by others, known as third-party products; other marketplaces, such as eBay, offer only third-party products. In addition, several of the largest traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, including Kroger, Target, Urban Outfitters and Walmart, have incorporated third-party marketplaces into their online storefronts, allowing other brands and retailers to market their products to consumers they might not otherwise reach.
•Mainstream adoption of mobile devices for e-commerce.    Smartphones enable new consumer shopping behaviors, such as in-store barcode scanning to find online promotions, better pricing or alternative products. While benefiting consumers by increasing the transparency and accessibility of e-commerce, the proliferation of mobile devices and mobile commerce requires brands and retailers to build additional device-specific optimization and functionality into their websites, increasing the complexity of managing their online presences.
•Growth of additional online consumer touch points.    As consumers have moved more of their shopping and product discovery online, search engines, social networks and certain comparison shopping sites such as Google Shopping, as well as brand websites, have emerged as key influencers and important points of product research for consumers making purchase decisions. 
•Changing e-commerce landscape. In an effort to stay relevant to consumers, the large e-commerce platforms are expanding their offerings. Third-party marketplaces are monetizing their significant online traffic through search advertising, while traditional search engines and social networks are adding marketplace capabilities. The result is that brands and retailers need to have additional skills, tools and competencies to compete in this increasingly complex world.
•Expansion of the global e-commerce ecosystem.    The increasingly global e-commerce ecosystem presents opportunities for brands and retailers to extend their online presence through country- or region-specific marketplaces, such as Alibaba in Asia, Zalando in Europe and The Iconic in Australia. Conversely, the growth of marketplaces such as Amazon into new countries is driving selling opportunities for brands and retailers to sell to a broader, global audience.
•Widespread use of social networking and commerce applications.    The rapid growth of social networking and commerce applications provides a valuable channel through which brands and retailers can connect to consumers.
Challenges with alternative e-commerce solutions
The fragmentation and increasing complexity of e-commerce channels are placing greater demands on brands and retailers that seek to grow their online sales. These brands and retailers require solutions that will enable them to easily integrate their product offerings and inventory across multiple online channels. Traditional solutions, however, typically suffer from several limitations, including the following:
•In-house solutions are costly and may be slow to adapt to industry change and innovation.    To maintain pace with the speed of change and innovation of online channels, brands and retailers that rely on in-house capabilities are required to invest in and maintain significant technological infrastructure, human resources and industry relationships. Successful in-house solutions may typically require longer periods of setup time, substantial up-front capital expenditures and significant ongoing maintenance expense.
•Point solutions are limited in functionality and channels supported.    There are numerous narrowly tailored, or point, solutions available for brands and retailers to help them manage single online channels or a single category of channels, but these point solutions often do not address the needs of brands and retailers seeking to manage pricing and inventory across multiple channels through a single, unified platform. 
•Solutions provided by the channels are not aligned with customers' broader online goals.    Most online channels offer their own solutions that help brands and retailers connect with their specific channel and provide basic inventory control and data reporting functionality. By their very nature, however, these solutions are not channel independent and cannot help customers coordinate or optimize their online sales across the multiple online avenues available to them. As with point solutions, brands and retailers must work with disparate third-party providers to connect with a broad array of channels, which requires significant time and costs.
•Neither in-house nor point solutions adequately address fulfillment requirements, leading to error-prone processes.    In-house and point solutions tend to focus on point-to-point connectivity from channels to enterprise resource planning, with separate resources focusing on enterprise resource planning to fulfillment. This design leads to a disconnected experience, decreasing speed of fulfillment and increasing risk of product being out of stock. Slower fulfillment and delayed shipments negatively impact customer satisfaction and online sales. 
SaaS solutions generally offer customers several distinct advantages over traditional in-house models, known as on-premises solutions, including lower upfront and ongoing costs, faster speed of implementation and less reliance on internal IT staff.
THE CHANNELADVISOR PLATFORM
The ChannelAdvisor multichannel commerce platform allows our customers to more easily integrate, manage and optimize their e-commerce operations across the entire consumer journey.
Specifically, our platform allows brands and retailers to:
•Connect to hundreds of global channels including marketplaces, dropship retailers, search and shopping engines, social media and online storefronts in order to meet consumers where they prefer to discover and shop, without having to separately integrate with each channel.
•Market effectively to consumers on those channels by automating and optimizing processes related to the management of product content, pricing, advertising, competitive analysis and brand protection.
•Sell products to interested consumers on global marketplaces, in web stores, through resellers or, for some brands, by connecting those shoppers directly to authorized retail partners from their own sites and digital campaigns.
•Fulfill orders in a timely manner through integrations with global distribution, fulfillment and logistics providers.
•Optimize e-commerce performance by highlighting channel sales and advertising results along with opportunities for improvement, and enabling brands to monitor their products on reseller sites globally.
We offer our platform customers the choice of self-service accounts or managed-service accounts. Self-service customers operate our software themselves, while managed-service customers generally outsource most or all of the management of one or more channels to our experienced services team, which then provides services, including the operation of our software on the customer's behalf, based on best practices and the customer's instructions.
Specific platform capabilities include the following:
Connect
ChannelAdvisor helps brands and retailers connect to hundreds of global channels
Connecting to global channels involves sophisticated integrations with unique requirements per channel. Our platform includes the following key capabilities to help brands and retailers efficiently manage global sales and advertising channels:
•Integrations. Our platform is integrated with hundreds of channels, including global marketplaces, search and shopping engines, social media, web stores and dropship retailers. Our customers can also create product feeds to custom destinations.
•Product catalog. Our platform allows customers to upload and regularly update their product catalog data with a single inventory feed using a sophisticated user interface, file exchange or application programming interface (API). Each customer has the flexibility to customize product catalog data attributes for its unique requirements and to vary the format of the data to meet the specific requirements of each channel.
•Product matching. Once the product catalog is loaded, our platform provides features that improve the ability of our customers to successfully list their products on the various channels. Depending on the needs of the particular channel, our platform can pre-validate customer data and formats before transmitting to the channel, reducing errors caused by poor data quality and reducing the time it takes to list products on that channel. On some channels, we employ advanced product-matching algorithms that are designed to accurately place the customer's product catalog within the channel's product classification taxonomy.
Market
ChannelAdvisor helps brands and retailers market the right products to the right consumers at the right time
Connecting to consumers involves having the right offer, a competitive price, accurate and descriptive product content, and effective advertising to capture consumer attention. Our platform includes the following key capabilities to help brands and retailers connect with consumers when they are ready to buy:
•Product content management and optimization. Our platform includes sophisticated tools and product listing templates for automating and optimizing product data for each channel. Brands and retailers can utilize these tools to customize product listing descriptions across various channels using product attributes. These features allow customers to automatically advertise and offer millions of products on multiple channels while ensuring accuracy of product content, availability and price at the individual product level. Our platform also allows brands to produce custom spreadsheets to provide product data to retailers that do not support an automated approach.
•Digital marketing management. Our platform and services provide customers the ability to create, manage and evaluate advertising using a variety of ad formats across multiple channels, including search engines, social networks, marketplaces and retail media. Our unified platform enables our customers to manage advertising across a large number of channels more efficiently and use information from one channel to inform decisions on other channels. Campaign optimization features such as bid management and keyword harvesting can help drive ad spend efficiency. 
•Shoppable Media solutions for digital campaigns. Our platform allows brands to create a one-click path to purchase from digital marketing and social campaigns, allowing for retail partners to be included in promotions while eliminating out-of-stock dead-ends by dynamically linking to in-stock retailers and product variations. Our platform also supports the creation of interstitials, which are ads that load between two content pages, such as pop-up ads, that enable consumers to choose preferred retailers after clicking on the digital campaign.
Sell
ChannelAdvisor helps brands and retailers sell products where consumers prefer to shop
Interested consumers are more likely to buy when the path to purchase is easy. To meet this need, brands and retailers require accurate product content, availability status and prices across their selling channels. Further, consumers researching a brand's products or seeing brand advertising may not always be aware of where those products are in-stock at that moment for purchase. Our platform helps create an easier path to purchase for interested consumers through the following capabilities:
•Inventory quantity and listing management. Our platform provides features that allow brands and retailers to list products on multiple channels while mitigating the risk of overselling. These features include the ability to allocate inventory across channels, set buffer quantities to avoid overselling and receive automatic updates based on changes to inventory. The platform supports regular updates to product listings to ensure that consumers have the most accurate product information, including availability and price.
•Pricing automation. Our platform provides customers the ability to dynamically price their products across some of our available channels in alignment with their margin goals. Our pricing algorithms take into account the 
channel, competitive environment, margin thresholds, historical product sales and sales velocity. Using our solution, customers can avoid the manual effort of monitoring the competition and changing prices, while preserving the ability to remain price competitive. Algorithmic repricing uses predictive analytics and machine learning that may help our customers increase sales while maximizing their margins.
•Shoppable Media solutions for brand sites. Our platform allows brands to host a dynamically updated widget on their product pages that presents consumers with online retailers that have products in-stock and that links directly to product pages or shopping carts on those retail sites. Similarly, the widget can present consumers with local offline stores close to the consumer that carry the brand's products. This creates an efficient path to purchase for the consumer, improves brand relationships with retailers, and provides brands with consumer insights.
Fulfill
ChannelAdvisor helps brands and retailers fulfill customer expectations
After placing an online order, customers expect quick, reliable and inexpensive or free shipping. Our platform includes the following key capabilities to help brands and retailers efficiently manage fulfillment operations:
•Order management automation. Our platform consolidates marketplace, online storefront and dropship retail orders into a consolidated, customizable view, where they can be tagged, managed and exported in a variety of formats. Customers can manage delivery status, dates and tracking numbers.
•Shipping management. Our platform integrates with a wide range of fulfillment options to enable maximum flexibility and resiliency for our customers. For customers that fulfill from their own warehouses, our platform provides shipping management functionality, including shipping label generation, connections to carriers and integrations with various shipping management solutions. Our platform also supports Fulfillment by Amazon, Walmart Fulfillment Services, Zalando Fulfillment Services, and integrations with a number of third-party logistics providers, supporting features such as synchronization of product availability, the generation and distribution of custom purchase orders and simplification of order status management.
•Dropship fulfillment. We provide advanced support for dropshipping to help ease common challenges. Our platform allows for the easy mapping of product catalogs to those of channel partners, helps avoid overselling through integrated inventory quantity management, incorporates intelligent order routing to find the best distributor based on availability, cost and shipping speed and enables the management of tracking updates.
•Custom fulfillment connections. We can provide support for brands that are expanding or looking to more efficiently manage existing fulfillment capabilities by building, managing and monitoring connections to distribution points within the fulfillment network.
Our fulfillment capabilities are enhanced by strategic partnerships with leaders in logistics and fulfillment. 
Optimize
ChannelAdvisor helps brands and retailers optimize e-commerce strategies to improve results
•Direct-to-consumer channel performance. For brands and retailers, our dashboards highlight sales trends, top performing products, seller reputation, repricing activity and buy box attainment, among other key performance indicators. The dashboards also alert customers to issues or errors, such as data that is in a form inconsistent with the requirements of a particular channel. These capabilities provide actionable, cross-channel insights that allow customers to quickly revise their business rules, listings and ads with the goal of improving sales and profitability.
•Digital shelf analytics. Our platform enables global multichannel brands to manage online distribution, grow sales and protect their brand reputation. Brand Analytics solutions help brands monitor product assortment and availability on retail channels, understand pricing dynamics, identify areas for search performance improvement on the digital shelf and ensure that the brand looks its best through the use of approved product content and responses to critical customer reviews.
PLATFORM MODULES
While our platform allows our customers to more easily integrate, manage and optimize their online sales across the entire consumer journey, our customers will often enter a relationship with us focused on one aspect of that journey. To that end, we offer our solutions as a series of modules, including:
•Marketplaces. Our Marketplaces module connects customers to hundreds of third-party marketplaces across the globe, including Amazon, eBay, Google, Newegg, Overstock.com, Target, TradeMe, Walmart and Zalando. It also allows for the connection to web stores, such as Shopify, BigCommerce and Magento. In addition, this module allows our customers to compete more effectively through access to advertising programs, fulfillment services and other advanced features on major marketplaces. Further, brands and distributors can manage purchase orders, shipment notifications, stock quantities and invoices for multiple retail dropship partners.
•Digital Marketing. Our Digital Marketing module allows customers to generate and send customized product data feeds to advertising channels and other channel partners, including affiliate networks, retargeting vendors, personalization vendors and product review platforms. It enables customers to advertise on comparison shopping websites such as Google Shopping, search engines such as Google and Microsoft's Bing, and social commerce sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest. The Digital Marketing module also supports retail media advertising programs on retail and marketplace sites such as Amazon, eBay and Walmart. 
•Shoppable Media. Our Shoppable Media module allows brands to provide their web visitors with an easy path to purchase using dynamic links to in-stock retail product pages or carts, or with information on where products can be purchased from local retail stores. The solution is designed to improve the consumer experience and help brands gain a better understanding of consumer behavior through detailed data about the flow of traffic between the brand and retailer. It also allows brands to make digital campaigns shoppable, enabling a one-click path to purchase from digital marketing and social campaigns or an interstitial that allows consumers to choose preferred retailers after clicking on the digital campaign.
•Brand Analytics. Our Brand Analytics module helps global brands gain a competitive advantage on their e-commerce channels with actionable insights into how their products are performing on the digital shelf across thousands of retailer websites and marketplaces.
PLATFORM BENEFITS
We believe our platform offers the following key benefits for our customers:
•Single, fully integrated solution.    Through our SaaS platform, we provide our customers with a single web-based interface as the central location to control, analyze and manage their online sales across hundreds of available channels and multiple geographies. This unified view enables our customers to more cost-effectively manage product listings, inventory availability, pricing optimization, fulfillment, search terms, ad campaigns, data analytics and other critical functions across channels based on the customer's specific rules and performance metrics in order to drive traffic and increase revenue.
•Reduced integration costs, time to market and dependence on in-house resources. Customers can quickly and more easily introduce their products, both to channels on which they already have a presence and to new channels, without the costs related to installing and maintaining their own hardware and software infrastructure. A customer's initial installation and integration of our solutions can often be completed in less than two months, with additional modules generally available without committing significant additional resources to integrate. We manage and host our solutions on behalf of our customers, thereby reducing the customer's cost and dependency on dedicated IT staff or on-premises systems.
•Scalable technology platform. The scalability of our platform allows us to quickly and efficiently support an increasing number of product listings and transactions as we add new customers, integrate new channels and accommodate seasonal surges in consumer demand.
•Security and privacy. Our platform and infrastructure are designed to ensure the security of customer data and consumer data throughout all data storage and processing in compliance with global and applicable local privacy laws.
•Flexibility to adapt and instantaneous access to our most up-to-date capabilities. Channels frequently update their product information requirements, policies, merchandising strategies and integration specifications, requiring their customers to frequently revise their product listings, attributes, business rules and possibly even their overall online business strategies. Without the ability to quickly adapt to these changes, their customers risk suspension or removal from a marketplace and loss of revenue. Through our single code base and multi-tenant architecture, we provide our customers with the latest channel updates through regular product upgrades. When we develop and 
deploy new features, functions and capabilities, or make changes to keep up with the changing priorities and requirements of each channel, our customers simultaneously benefit from those new capabilities and changes.
•Data and reporting analytics. Through our platform's analytics and reporting capabilities, we provide our customers with insight into channel and product performance. Our dashboards highlight sales trends, top performing products, seller reputation and repricing activity, among other key performance indicators, and alert customers to issues and errors in product listings. These capabilities provide actionable insights that allow customers to evaluate and improve business results on existing or new channels. Additionally, our solution provides brands with insights about online assortment, product coverage gaps, pricing trends, customer reviews, and adherence by their retailers to content guidelines.
OUR TECHNOLOGY
Our platform is and always has been a cloud-based SaaS solution. We provide a single code base and multi-tenant architecture for our platform customers, which means that all customers operate on the same version of our software and that we do not customize our products for individual platform customers. Because of this, there is no need for our customers to download, install or upgrade software.
Our platform is highly configurable and designed to ensure that customers have the flexibility needed to implement their business processes. We have developed our proprietary technology platform with a focus on delivering industry-leading breadth, scalability, reliability and flexibility. 
We develop our software using rapid iterations through small, incremental changes that are continuously integrated into our code base. Incremental improvements are generally released daily, with more significant enhancements and capabilities communicated approximately every 90 days. Because of our architecture, our customers benefit from our new capabilities as soon as they are made available.
Our platform uses a hybrid cloud architecture in which we utilize secure third-party data center facilities located in North America, as well as cloud-based infrastructure in North America and Europe. In the data center facilities, we deploy hardware we own, including servers, networking systems and storage systems. We use virtualization to maximize the utilization we achieve from our hardware systems. The data center facilities are biometrically secured, environmentally controlled and redundantly powered. We employ system security, including firewalls, encryption technology and antivirus software, and we conduct regular system tests and vulnerability and intrusion assessments. In the event of failure, we have engineered our systems with backup and recovery capabilities designed to provide for business continuity. We also make use of additional third-party cloud-based systems, such as content delivery networks, to augment the capabilities of our platform.
Developer Ecosystem
We offer third-party developers of complementary e-commerce solutions access to our platform through APIs, which enable those developers to build connections to our platform that meet their specific needs without requiring us to offer customized software code. We currently provide APIs to hundreds of third-party developers who have integrated their solutions with ours. For example, our API integrates our platform with business software provided by NetSuite, a provider of SaaS enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and e-commerce solutions, to further streamline our joint customers' e-commerce operations.
KEY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AFFECTING OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Given the rapidly evolving e-commerce landscape and increased demand for our proprietary SaaS cloud platform, particularly driven by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer shopping habits, in 2020 and 2021 we achieved substantial growth in revenue, especially from our brands customers, as well as adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. We intend to continue making incremental strategic investments focused on driving revenue growth, maintaining strong margin performance and building shareholder value. We expect our financial performance in the future to be driven by our ability to:
•Increase penetration and expansion opportunities with new and existing brands customers;
•Maintain an appropriate number of sales representatives to address anticipated increases in demand for our platform;
•Enhance our services organization with investments in people and technology to better serve our customers;
•Expand the number of marketplaces with which we integrate to further enhance transaction volume from marketplaces; and
•Execute on strategic investments in product innovation targeted to expand and optimize our platform and drive new revenue streams. 
OUR CUSTOMERS
During the year ended December 31, 2021, no single customer accounted for more than 1.7% of our total revenue. Increased penetration with new and existing brands customers is a key strategic priority for our company. Consequently, we have seen an increasing proportion of our customer base and revenues come from brands customers as more brands seek to directly manage and optimize the advertising and selling of their products online. We generally categorize a customer as a brand if it primarily focuses on selling its own proprietary products. Over the last two years, we have made strategic investments in our sales and services organizations to accelerate new brands customer acquisition, as well as expansions with and retention of existing brands customers. These investments have helped drive record net bookings results and sustained revenue growth over this time period. For the year ended December 31, 2021, brands customers represented approximately 40% of our total revenue compared to approximately 33% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Subscription revenue from brands customers represented approximately 45% of total subscription revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to approximately 38% for the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe this is a positive trend and we will continue to focus our efforts on serving this important customer group. Our goal is to generate at least half of our revenues from brands by the end of 2022. 
Our revenue fluctuates as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally due to the peak consumer demand and related increased volume of our customers' GMV during the year-end holiday season. As a result, we have historically had higher revenue in our fourth quarter than other quarters due to increased GMV processed through our platform, resulting in higher variable fees. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our research and development efforts are focused on enhancing the architecture of our technology platform, creating additional functionality for our customers, enhancing our external developer APIs and maintaining and extending the various points of integration we have to the online channels we support. We recorded research and development costs of $22.4 million, $19.0 million and $19.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in research and development costs is due to our investment in resources and technology to support the growth of our business.
COMPETITION
The market for products that help brands and retailers reach online consumers is competitive. The competitive dynamics of our market are unpredictable because it is rapidly evolving, fragmented and subject to potential disruption by new technological innovations and the ability of channels to compete with us or make changes to which we need to rapidly adapt.
Several competitors provide solutions that compete with some of the capabilities of our platform, including those who provide software or services to connect brands and retailers with one or more online channels. We also compete with in-house solutions used by brands and retailers that elect to build and maintain their own proprietary integrations to online channels. In addition, we compete with the channels themselves, which typically offer software tools, often for free, allowing brands and retailers to connect to them.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry include:
•industry expertise and thought leadership;
•relationships with leading online channels;
•relationships with leading brands and retailers;
•channel independence;
•breadth of online channels supported;
•integration of capabilities;
•reporting and analytic capabilities;
•proven and scalable technology; and
•brand awareness and reputation.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our ability to protect our intellectual property, including our technology, is an important factor in the success and continued growth of our business. We protect our intellectual property through trade secrets law, patents, copyrights, trademarks and contracts. Some of our technology relies upon third-party licensed intellectual property.
We have received patent protection for some of our technologies in the United States and expect to apply for additional patents to protect our intellectual property as appropriate. We own trademark registrations in the U.S., the European Union, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan and Brazil for ChannelAdvisor and expect to apply for additional trademark registrations as appropriate.
In addition to the foregoing, we have established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements and assignment-of-inventions agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
The legal environment of the internet is evolving rapidly in the United States and elsewhere. The manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the internet in general, and how they will relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, are often unclear. For example, we often cannot be certain how existing laws will apply in the e-commerce and online context, including with respect to such topics as privacy, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, content regulation, quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Furthermore, it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as sales and other taxes and personal privacy will apply to the internet, as many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the internet or e-commerce. It is also unclear how the laws that do reference the internet will be interpreted by courts, which may impact their applicability and scope. Compliance may be costly and may require us to modify our business practices and product offerings. In addition, it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on the websites of our customers or may even attempt to completely block access to those websites. Noncompliance or perceived noncompliance could also subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. Accordingly, adverse legal or regulatory developments could substantially harm our business.
Customers load product information and other content onto our platform, generally without any control or oversight by us, at which point we may legally be considered to be the distributor of that content. This presents legal challenges to our business and operations, such as rights of privacy or intellectual property rights related to the content loaded onto our platform. Both in the United States and internationally, we must monitor and comply with a host of legal concerns regarding the content loaded onto our platform. The scope of our liability for third-party content loaded to our platform for delivery to various online e-commerce channels may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may vary depending on the type of claim, such as privacy, infringement or defamation claims. Our ability to employ processes to quickly remove infringing or offending content from our platform, for example, is an important tool in protecting us from exposure for the potentially infringing activities of our users worldwide. We also incorporate protections in customer contracts that allow us to take steps, if needed, to limit our risk regarding much of the content loaded onto, and collected by, our platform and solutions.
Numerous laws and regulatory schemes have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States and internationally that have a direct impact on our business and operations. These laws include, but are not limited to, the following:
Copyright and trademark.    The Copyright Act of 1976 and the statutes and regulations associated with copyrights and trademarks and enforced by the United States Patent and Trademark Office are intended to protect the rights of third parties from infringement. Using our automated service, customers can generally upload any content they designate for use with our solutions. We maintain an active copyright and trademark infringement policy and respond to take-down requests by third-party intellectual property right owners that might result from content posted by our customers using our solutions. As our business expands to other countries, we must also respond to regional and country-specific intellectual property considerations, including take-down and cease and desist notices in foreign languages, and we must build infrastructure to support these processes. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, also applies to our business. This statute provides relief for claims of circumvention of copyright-protected technologies but includes a safe harbor that is intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others. Our copyright and trademark infringement policy is intended to satisfy the DMCA safe harbor in order to reduce our liability for customer-generated materials incorporated into our platform.
Data privacy and security.    Data privacy and security with respect to the collection of personally identifiable information continues to be a focus of worldwide legislation and compliance review. Examples include statutes adopted by states that require online services to report breaches of the security of personal information, and to report to customers when their personal information might be disclosed to direct marketers. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, went into effect on January 1, 2020 and gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that term is broadly defined) and provide such consumers new ways to opt out of certain sales of personal information. A new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was approved by California voters November 3, 2020. The CPRA will create additional obligations relating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1, 2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. Aspects of the CCPA and the CPRA (referred to collectively as "the California Legislation"), and their interpretation and enforcement, remain uncertain. Some observers have noted that the California Legislation could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, and we expect that new legislation proposed or enacted in various other states will continue to shape the data privacy environment nationally. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to confidential, sensitive and personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. For example, Virginia recently passed its Consumer Data Protection Act and Colorado recently passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which differ from the California Legislation and go into effect on January 1, 2023 and July 1, 2023, respectively.
In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect in May 2018 with the intent of unifying data protection within the European Union under a single law. The GDPR has resulted in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies with customers and operations in the European Union. The GDPR introduced a number of privacy-related changes for companies operating in the European Union, including greater control for data subjects (e.g., the "right to be forgotten"), increased data portability for European Union consumers, data breach notification requirements and increased fines. In particular, under the GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the non-compliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPR's requirements. This government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the European Union. These laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information. The European Court of Justice invalidated the use of the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield with which we were self-certified and had enabled the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States. We now make use of alternative data transfer mechanisms such as standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, or SCCs. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission adopted new SCCs under the GDPR for personal data transfers outside the EU.
Further, the United Kingdom's vote in favor of exiting the European Union, referred to as Brexit, and ongoing developments in the United Kingdom have created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. Currently, the data protection obligations of the GDPR continue to apply to the United Kingdom related to processing of personal data in substantially unvaried form and fashion under the UK GDPR. Also, on June 28, 2021, the European Commission announced a decision of "adequacy" concluding that the UK ensures an equivalent level of data protection to the GDPR, which provides some relief regarding the legality of continued personal data flows from the EEA to the UK. Some uncertainty remains, however, as this adequacy determination must be renewed after four years and may be modified or revoked in the interim. We cannot fully predict how the Data Protection Act, the UK GDPR, and other UK data protection laws or regulations may develop in the medium to longer term nor the effects of divergent laws and guidance regarding how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated. However, going forward, there will be increasing scope for divergence in application, interpretation and enforcement of the data protection law as between the United Kingdom and EEA. 
We will continue to follow developments and work to maintain conforming means of transferring data from Europe, but despite our efforts to address continuing changes, we may be unsuccessful in establishing conforming means of transferring data from Europe.
We post on our website our privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of user data. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requirements or guidance or other privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings by governmental or regulatory bodies that could potentially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
In this regard, there are a large number of legislative proposals before the U.S. Congress and various state legislative bodies regarding privacy issues that could affect our business. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted, and certain proposals, if adopted, could harm our business through a decrease in customers and revenue. These 
decreases could be caused by, among other possible provisions, the required use of disclaimers or other requirements before prospective buyers can interact with our customers. For example, we have had to work with our customers to comply with the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 instituted by the United Kingdom, commonly referred to as the UK Cookie Law, which was designed to protect computer users from technologies identifying their computers and specified activities conducted on those computers without the users' consent. We use tracking technology to track purchases from our customers through our platform, in order to calculate variable fees owed by our customers, among other things. Prohibiting or inhibiting such tracking could make it difficult or impossible to monitor our variable fees. The interpretation and implementation of processes to comply with the UK Cookie Law continues to evolve, and we cannot predict how any new laws will apply to us or our business. Similar "do not track" legislative proposals have been considered in the United States at the federal level, although none have been enacted to date. If enacted, such legislative proposals could prohibit or restrict the use of certain technologies, including tracking technology.
Unsolicited e-mails and communications.    The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws adopted by a number of states regulate unsolicited commercial e-mails, create criminal penalties for unmarked sexually-oriented material and e-mails containing fraudulent headers and control other abusive online marketing practices. Similarly, FTC guidelines impose responsibilities upon us and our customers for communications with consumers and impose fines and liability for any failure to comply with rules relating to advertising or marketing practices that the FTC may deem misleading or deceptive. The European Union also maintains standards and regulations with respect to communications with consumers that we must comply with as we expand our marketing practices into those countries or with which our customers, utilizing our solutions, must comply. Some ways we seek to comply with these measures include requiring our customers to communicate with their consumers in order to comply with laws concerning spam and unsolicited emails and establishing processes to allow direct receivers of e-mail marketing communications from us to opt out of future communications.
Credit card protections.    The Payment Card Industry Council, or PCI Council, established and maintains security standards for companies that transmit, store or process credit card data. The PCI Council has created the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS. Though the PCI DSS is not law, merchants are required by contracts among various stakeholders in the credit card ecosystem to comply with the PCI DSS, with associated fines and penalties for non-compliance. Elements of the PCI DSS have begun to emerge as law in some states, however, and we expect the trend to continue as to further laws and restrictions in collecting and using credit card information. We do not receive, process, or store any credit card information, which we believe limits our exposure to liability under the PCI DSS. We utilize a third-party processor to collect credit card data in processing the fees paid to us by our customers. The third-party is certified as PCI DSS compliant for internet / e-commerce payment processing.
EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES 
We believe our obligations as a corporation are multifaceted and that it is consistent with our duty to stockholders to also focus on the well-being of our employees and their level of engagement with us. We have developed policies and programs to attract, develop, motivate and retain exceptional employees to maintain our culture and uphold our ethical standards.
To accomplish this, we offer competitive total rewards, invest in ongoing learning and development, promote diversity, equity and inclusion, and focus on employee health, safety and well-being. ChannelAdvisor has formed a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) task force that is focused on five key DE&I objectives for the company: driving awareness, accelerating opportunity, improving access, advocacy and accountability. We encourage you to read our Diversity Annual Report on our company website at www.channeladvisor.com/about/diversity-and-inclusion for additional information. This information is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. We are proud of our long history of inclusion and our merit-based culture, but also believe there is more work to do to promote DE&I internally and externally. We have also established seven employee-led employee resource groups, or ERGs, that aim to promote DE&I, foster and strengthen workplace culture, enhance professional development and leadership abilities and promote career growth and success. 
Our benefits programs are designed to be market competitive and to attract and retain our employees. We strive to offer plans that are financially competitive and provide sufficient time off and flexible work arrangements. Full-time U.S. employees working 30 or more hours per week are eligible for a wide range of benefits, including medical insurance, telemedicine, flexible spending accounts, dental insurance, vision insurance, life and disability insurance, 401(k) retirement plan and paid time off, or PTO, starting at 20 days per year. We offer our employees a global employee assistance program, or EAP, with services available at no cost for all ChannelAdvisor employees. Our EAP offers confidential support and services in a number of areas, including life and work, mind and body, financial and legal and crisis support. In addition, we conduct surveys on a regular basis to assess employee engagement and the responses to our surveys reflect a high level of satisfaction. We use insights from our surveys and other employee feedback, including through town halls and other communication channels, to inform our human capital resources plans. We are also focused on comprehensive succession planning and development programs at all levels throughout the organization. We often promote candidates from within our existing employee base, for example. 
We recognize the importance of giving back to our communities, and encourage employees to support causes that are important to them. Therefore, all employees receive one additional day of PTO each calendar year to be used for volunteering and/or community service. This "Day to Give Back" PTO is provided in addition to the annual PTO allotment for which employees are already eligible.
The effects of COVID-19 and other external events over the last two years fundamentally altered how we support and engage our employees. Faced with the global COVID-19 crisis, we moved to a virtual work environment in March 2020, putting employee safety and well-being first, and were successful in making this transition. Because we were able to sustain employee productivity despite our virtual work environment, in early 2021, we implemented a permanent global flexible work policy that allows substantially all of our employees to choose a working environment that best suits their needs and the needs of our customers and our business. 
 We believe the human capital programs we have in place are market competitive and recognized by our employees, as evidenced by our having been recognized by Triangle Business Journal as a member of the 2021 class of "Best Places to Work" in the Triangle region of North Carolina, the seventh time we have won this recognition. 
Our Board of Directors provides oversight of our approach to and investment in human capital management and leadership and talent development. Directly, and through its Compensation Committee and Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, the Board engages regularly with management on human capital matters. As of December 31, 2021, we had 846 full-time personnel spanning seven countries, reflecting various backgrounds, ages, gender identities and ethnicities. Certain of our employees in various countries outside of the United States are subject to laws providing representation rights. We consider our relationship with our employees to be strong.
