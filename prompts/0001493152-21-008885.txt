ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report, references to the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” and words of similar import refer to QSAM Biosciences, Inc., the Registrant, a Delaware corporation. References to “QSAM” or the “Subsidiary” refer to QSAM Therapeutics Inc., a Texas corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary and operating company.
 
Organizational History
 
The Company, formerly known as Q2Earth, Inc. (“Q2Earth”), was organized pursuant of the laws of the State of Delaware on August 26, 2004. Since 2015, the Company has transformed its business model, operations and management several times, most relevantly commencing with the November 12, 2015 merger of Q2Power Corp. into a newly formed and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, then called Ampath Group Inc. In August 2017, the Company sold the waste-to-power technology that it was then developing to a licensee and re-focused its efforts and resources to the pursuit of acquisitions and management of companies and assets in the business of compost and soil manufacturing. In June 2017, the Company changed its name to Q2Earth, Inc. to better reflect its new business model.
 
On November 6, 2020, the Company entered into an Omnibus Separation Agreement (the “Separation Agreement”) with its unconsolidated investee, Earth Property Holdings LLC (“EPH”). Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved the Separation Agreement in furtherance of its previously disclosed plan to secure new technologies and business opportunities in the broader biosciences sector, and to significantly reduce debt and liabilities of the Company and eliminate under-performing assets and agreements.
 
The Separation Agreement marked a discontinuance of the Company’s compost operations to focus solely on the development of its exclusively licensed radiopharmaceutical drug candidate, Samarium-153-DOTMP, aka CycloSam® (“CycloSam” or the “New Technology”), as well as other drug candidates that it may license or otherwise secure in the future.
 
Pursuant to the Separation Agreement:
 

● | The Management Agreement, dated January 18, 2019, as amended, between EPH and the Company was terminated by mutual agreement of the parties. Fees from this agreement constituted most of the Company’s revenue over the prior two years. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In lieu of any severance or other termination payments due under the Management Agreement, EPH released the Company from a total of $993,985 in liabilities, inclusive of advanced management fees and multiple promissory notes, including accrued and unpaid interest. An additional $114,700 in promissory notes plus accrued interest owed to an affiliate of EPH were converted into Company common stock at a price of $0.22 per share, and consequently, was retired as of December 31, 2020. 
● | The prior officers and employees of the Company engaged in the compost and soil manufacturing business were released from any non-competition, non-solicitation or other restricted covenant pursuant to their respective employment agreements. Several of these employees solely engaged in the legacy compost business had been removed from payroll as of October 1, 2020. 
● | The Company agreed to transfer to EPH the License Agreement with Agrarian Technologies LLC and Mulch Masters Inc. for the ABS product and all associated knowhow, trade secrets and trademark/service marks (the “ABS License”). All liabilities associated with the ABS License were also transferred to and assumed by EPH. 
● | EPH received the right in its sole discretion to use the name “Q2Earth” in all jurisdictions of the United States and worldwide.

At the end of 2020, the Company held approximately an 18% subordinated equity interest in EPH and accounted for EPH as an unconsolidated investee entity. In March 2021, the Company sold these equity units to an unaffiliated third party for $100,000. Kevin Bolin, the prior Chairman and CEO of the Company, also serves as President of EPH; and Christopher Nelson, General Counsel and Director of the Company, also serves as General Counsel and Secretary of EPH.
 
Series B Financing. In January 2021, the Company closed a Series B Convertible Preferred Stock private placement (the “Series B Offering”) and issued a total of 2,500 shares at a price of $1,000 per share, raising an aggregate amount of $2.5 million inclusive of the conversion of approximately $156,000 in debt. The offering, which commenced in 2020, was led by Checkmate Capital Group, LLC, a California based investment firm focused on biotechnology and other technology investments. The Company completed the offering primarily to advance its new business of drug development including funding the Company’s upcoming clinical trials for its flagship drug candidate CycloSam, as well as for general working capital and overhead.
 
The shares of Series B Preferred Stock are convertible into an aggregate of approximately 16.6 million shares of common stock of the Company and have voting rights alongside common stockholders on an as-converted basis. In January 2021, our Board approved a modification to the Series B Preferred Stock offering terms, and investors in the offering were issued in 2021 non-registered warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 6.27 million shares of common stock at $0.35 per share prior to July 8, 2021. For its performance in support of the offering, Checkmate Capital earned in January 2021 a 12 month warrant to acquire 475,000 shares of common stock at $0.45 per share.
 
Bridge Note Financing. The Company issued a total of $2,851,908 in Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Bridge Notes”) during 2017, 2018 and 2019. Proceeds from the Bridge Notes were used to for the Company’s legacy business. As of December 31, 2020, a total of $1,965,030 plus $964,525 in accrued interest on the Bridge Notes were converted into approximately 13.3 million shares of common stock. As of March 31, 2021, the remaining $1,447,312 of principal and interest was converted into 6,578,702 shares of common stock, and no Bridge Notes currently remain outstanding.
 
Current Drug Development Business
 
The Company’s current business is the development of Samarium-153 DOTMP aka CycloSam® (“CycloSam” or the “New Technology”), a novel radiopharmaceutical being developed for the treatment of bone cancers and related diseases. The Company seeks to enter clinical trials this year for CycloSam as a treatment for cancer that has metastasized to the bone from the lung, breast, prostate and other areas, as well as for certain primary bone cancers such as osteosarcoma. Ultimately, the Company may seek to commercialize CycloSam for one or more market indications or license the technology to a larger pharmaceutical partner.
 
What is CycloSam. CycloSam is comprised of a combination of the radioactive isotope Samarium-153 and the chelant DOTMP (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecanetetramethylene-phosphonic acid). Chelating agents are organic compounds capable of linking together metal ions to form complex ring-like structures. This combination forms a stable complex which delivers a radioactive dose to sites of rapid bone mineral turnover, such as bone cancers and tumors. CycloSam has a physical half-life of 46 hours and emits both medium-energy beta particles which produce the therapeutic effect, and gamma photons that make it possible to locate the anatomical distribution. Projected use of CycloSam as either a monotherapy or in combination with other more widely used treatments has the potential to minimize the amount and use of toxic modalities.
 
How is CycloSam believed to work. Through current research and studies, we believe CycloSam seeks out locations of high bone turnover which are adjacent to the tumor. The radiation from the Samarium-153 has the effect of killing the cancer cells or slowing their growth by damaging their DNA with minimal damage observed to healthy cells. Cancer cells, whose DNA is damaged beyond repair, stop dividing or die. When the damaged cells die, they are broken down and removed by the body. Generally, radiation therapy does not kill cancer cells right away and more than one treatment is expected to be needed to kill a tumor or dramatically reduce its size using CycloSam. Samarium-153 has a short half-life (46 hours), which means it can be rapidly eliminated from the body, avoiding an undesirable radioactive buildup in key organs when used in multiple treatments.

History of CycloSam development and past studies and trials
 
CycloSam was developed at IsoTherapeutics Group, LLC (“IsoTherapeutics”) by its founders Jim Simone, PhD and R. Keith Frank, PhD, who also developed one of the first commercial radiopharmaceuticals on the market, called Quadramet®. Messrs. Simone and Frank each have over 30 years of experience in radiopharmaceuticals and have published more than 100 papers and authored over 60 patents in the field. According to the inventors, CycloSam was developed to address the shortcomings of other radiopharmaceuticals such as toxicity, saturation effects and long-lived impurities.
 
CycloSam has completed extensive animal studies in both small and large animals, as well as treating bone cancer in actual patient dogs at a university veterinary clinic. In addition to the extensive animal work, the Company has treated one human patient under a Single Patient Investigational New Drug (IND) for Emergency Use at the Cleveland Clinic where CycloSam showed promising results in connection with a bone marrow ablation procedure.
 
How is CycloSam differentiated in the market. CycloSam is believed to have significant advantages over current radiopharmaceutical offerings. Key differentiators are believed to include a short half-life (46 hours), minimal radionuclidic impurities, and no or minimal saturation effect allowing for repeated dosing. Its novel chelant delivers the radioactive “payload” adjacent to the tumor and, Samaium-153 being a beta emitter, is believed to enable it to travel farther than competitive alpha emitters. Thus, CycloSam is believed to be able to deeply penetrate the target tumor.
 

Potential Market Indications. CycloSam’s therapeutic profile and presumed advantages over other radiopharmaceuticals translate to several potential key indications as detailed in the following table:
 

Market | Estimated Patients (US) 
---------------------------------------------+----------------------------
Primary Bone Cancer - Osteosarcoma | 850 
Other Primary Bone Cancers | 2,400 
Bone Metastases (Breast, Prostate, Lung) | 280,000 
Bone Marrow Ablation | 15,000

Preclinical and Clinical Studies
 
Preclinical Studies. Preclinical toxicology studies of CycloSam in rats and dogs have shown that a single intravenous dose of non-radioactive Samarium-153 DOTMP elicited no systemic toxicity. Skeletal uptake has also been studied in rats over a wide range of doses to determine whether Samarium-153 DOTMP displays a similar saturation effect which has been observed in studies of Samarium-153 EDTMP (aka Quadramet). In the rat saturation study, no statistically significant difference was found in uptake as a function of increased dosage of Samarium-153 DOTMP. Additionally, a proof of concept study was conducted in ten dogs with spontaneously occurring bone cancer treated with 1-2 mCi/kg of Samarium-153 DOTMP. Treatment was well tolerated with seven dogs treated at a dose of 1 mCi/kg and one dog treated with 2 mCi/kg who did not experience a dose limiting toxicity. One dog treated with 2 mCi/kg and one dog treated with 2.3 mCi/kg experienced grade 4 asymptomatic thrombocytopenia and neutropenia; which refers to a manageable depressed level of platelets and neutrophils in the blood. Results from these preclinical studies suggested Samarium-153 DOTMP has potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of primary bone cancer and metastatic bone disease.
 
Clinical Studies. Samarium-153 DOTMP has recently been studied for the first time in humans under a Single Patient Investigational New Drug (IND) for Emergency Use at the Cleveland Clinic. The patient, a 25 year-old male who suffered from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and high-risk osteosarcoma, received a single low dose of 1 mCi/kg of Samarium-153 DOTMP on March 24, 2020 for dosimetry. This was followed seven days later on March 31, 2020 by a single high dose of 32 mCi/kg (1919 mCi) of Samarium-153 DOTMP. No injection site effects were noted at the time of injection. At 48 hours post-injection of the second dose there was no renal toxicity observed. The estimated dose delivered to the skeleton was 40 Gy with bone lesion uptake of 60 Gy. Gy stands for “gray”, which is a measurement of radiation reaching the target. In this instance, a 45 Gy is considered required to deliver the radiation to the target, and therefore, 60 Gy was considered very good. The patient received an allogeneic stem cell transfusion two weeks following high dose injection of Samarium-153 DOTMP with no complications.
 
There were no adverse events or serious adverse events observed that were considered related to infusion of Samarium-153 DOTMP, nor was there evidence of osteosarcoma relapse at any point following Samarium-153 DOTMP infusion. The investigator concluded that high-dose Samarium-153 DOTMP can be given safely with no apparent renal toxicity and no unexpected adverse events attributable to Samarium-153 DOTMP. The investigator also concluded that the appearance of engraftment was indicative that Samarium-153 DOTMP had an effect on MDS. Skeletal targeting with sparing of other tissues was observed after the high dose.

Collaborations, Partnerships and Agreements
 
Collaborations, partnerships and agreements are a key component of the Company’s corporate strategy. As a clinical stage biotechnology company without revenue, partnerships are an essential part of our future development.
License Agreement. The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary QSAM Therapeutics, entered into an exclusive worldwide patent and technology license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with IGL Pharma, Inc. (“IGL”) on April 20, 2020 with respect to the innovative work of Jim Simone, PhD and R. Keith Frank, PhD, at IsoTherapeutics on Samarium-153 DOTMP. IGL is an affiliated company with IsoTherapeutics, and the President of IGL also serves as our Executive Chairman.
 
The License Agreement, unless sooner terminated in accordance with its terms, terminates upon the latter of (a) the expiration of the last to expire of the IGL/ISO patent rights; or (b) twenty years after the effective date of the license. IGL may terminate the License Agreement early upon the occurrence of certain defaults by the Company, including, but not limited to, a material breach by us that is not cured within a predefined period of time after notice of the breach is provided to us.
 
The License Agreement provides the Company with the exclusive commercial rights to the patent portfolio developed by IGL as of the effective date of the license and requires us to pay various milestone, legal, filing and licensing payments to commercialize the technology. Furthermore, IGL is entitled to receive a non-refundable initial license fee, royalty payments and milestone payments based on net sales and percentages of sublicense fees and certain regulatory and commercial milestones.
 
Contracted Research Organization. In February 2020 the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement (MSA) with a full-service Contract Research Organization (CRO) with over a 30 year history of service to pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients. The CRO has a full-time staff of project managers, statisticians, physicians, nurses and other regulatory and operational personnel to support the company’s FDA interactions, filings and preclinical and clinical trial activities. Specifically, the CRO provides clinical trial management services, clinical study monitoring services, medical coding services, electronic data capture services, data management services, medical monitoring services, safety reporting and medical writing services. The MSA was amended in February 2021 and includes a fixed monthly retainer for regulatory and clinical trial consulting services as well as specific work orders for clinical trial execution services.
 
Patents and IP
 
Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Company’s IP estate includes 15 total patents issued and pending across 3 distinct patent families that we believe provide protection for the use of CycloSam as a radiopharmaceutical in the U.S. and internationally. Under the License Agreement, the Company holds two issued patents in the US, one allowed patent in Europe, and 11 pending patents in international jurisdictions. Notably, the CycloSam kit that will be commercialized is protected by the extensive patent estate that broadly protects DOTMP kit formulations for radioisotopes, potentially allowing for efficient distribution of the product and widespread use. Additionally, the patents cover the use of low-specific activity Samarium-153 allowing for daily supply of the isotope, and methods relating to repeat dosing regimens for therapeutic radiopharmaceutical agents, which suggest increased efficacy based on prior research. Taken together, management believes that the patent family provides for a significant barrier to entry for a competitor as it is expected to prevent a generic product from being developed; however, we cannot guarantee that a competitor will not or cannot challenge our patents or otherwise circumvent our patents, or that we would have the resources to defend any patent infringement.

Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Company also has the right to use the registered trademark “CycloSam®” for the market and sale of the drug candidate.
 
Manufacturing
 
The Company has an established and validated process, as well as key partnerships in place for the just-in-time production of CycloSam on a named patient basis. Once prescribed by radiation oncologists and nuclear medicine physicians, the Company expects that it will order the radioisotopes from Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR) to be sent overnight to an onsite or nearby (to the patient) nuclear pharmacy to be compounded with a DOTMP “cold kit” and delivered to the treating physician for administration. MURR has been the source of supply for the Samarium-153 used in both animal studies and the single patient IND. MURR has verbally committed to supply Samarium-153 to the Company in the future, has the capability to produce the CycloSam product on a commercial scale for U.S. distribution, and is expected to be the primary supplier of the radionuclide to the Company in the U.S. subject to definitive agreements that management expects to complete in 2021. Management also plans to qualify additional suppliers in 2021 as part of a supply chain and general business risk diversification strategy.
 
The patented “cold kit” was developed and is supplied to nuclear pharmacies by IsoTherapeutics, the inventors of CycloSam. The IsoTherapeutics cGMP manufacturing facility has the capacity to manufacture sufficient supply for initial rollout. Secondary manufacturing partners are concurrently being secured. While CycloSam is still in clinical development, the Company believes it has already established an efficient and cost-effective manufacturing process, allowing the clinician to treat the patient within approximately three days from order.
 
Competition
 
Bone cancer treatment often relies on combinations of treatments and experimental approaches. Over the years, several treatment options that include chemotherapy (docetaxel, cabazitaxel), external beam radiotherapy, surgery, bisphosphonates (zoledronate), hormone therapy, monoclonal antibody therapy (XGEVA), immunotherapies (Sipulecel-T), SRC inhibitors, and radiopharmaceuticals have been introduced for bone pain palliation or the treatment of primary and secondary bone cancers. Most fail to significantly improve overall survival of patients, tumor regression or quality of life.

Compared with almost all other systemic cancer treatment options, use of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals has shown efficacy with minimal toxicity. Bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals have been cleared by the FDA for bone pain palliation and are showing promise for treating bone cancer. Though many bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals with therapeutic potential have been investigated, to management’s knowledge there are currently three agents approved for bone cancer, Quadramet®, Metastron™, and Xofigo®, though none are without shortcomings such as myelotoxicity, cost, and long-lived radioactive impurities.
 
CycloSam uses Samarium-153, which is a 46.3-hr half-life radionuclide, whereas Metastron uses Sr-89, with a half-life of 50.6 days. The shorter half-life of Samarium-153 is believed to more readily accommodate retreatments and administration of subsequent chemotherapy. Another proposed advantage is that CycloSam has a shorter range beta particle than does Metastron. The use of shorter range beta particles is believed to help to lessen damage to non-target tissue.
 
While CycloSam uses the beta-emitting radionuclide Samarium-153, Xofigo uses the alpha-emitting radionuclide Ra-223. Although both agents localize in osteoblastic bone, the therapeutic effect of CycloSam’s beta particles appears to extend to nearby cancer cells, whereas the effect of Xofigo’s alpha particles is limited to the site of uptake.
 
CycloSam and Quadramet both share the same beta-emitting isotope, Samarium-153. CycloSam, however, can be made with low specific-activity Samarium-153, which enables seven-day-a-week availability and contains negligible long-lived impurities, allowing multiple dosing regimens. Quadramet requires high specific-activity Samarium-153, which is available only once a week, contains much higher levels of long-lived impurities and has a higher cost. CycloSam and Quadramet also use different chelating agents. The chelator in CycloSam, DOTMP, forms a much more stable complex with samarium than the complex formed in Quadramet. Tests have shown that CycloSam requires a far lower chelant-to-metal ratio (3:1 vs 270:1) in the formulation, which thereby allows for much higher administered dosages without saturation of the uptake sites.
 
Management believes that CycloSam has advantageous half-life, radiation penetration, chelation efficiency, impurity profile and availability that makes it a better tolerated and more efficacious option for treating bone cancer.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Clinical trials, the drug approval process, and the marketing of drugs are intensively regulated in the United States and in all major foreign countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and related regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) of a clinical hold on trials, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of biopharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, and promotion of product we develop in the future.
 
The FDA’s policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of any candidate drug product or approval of new disease indications or label changes. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.

Marketing Approval
 
The process required by the FDA before new drugs may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | nonclinical laboratory and animal tests; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; 
● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use or uses; 
● | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites; and 
● | FDA approval of an NDA which must occur before a drug can be marketed or sold. 

 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all.
 
We will need to successfully complete additional clinical trials in order to be in a position to submit an NDA to the FDA. Future trials may not begin or be completed on schedule, if at all. Trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:
 

● | obtaining regulatory approval to commence a study; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | reaching agreement with third-party clinical trial sites and vendors and their subsequent performance in conducting accurate and reliable studies on a timely basis; 
● | obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a study at a prospective site; 
● | recruiting subjects to participate in a study; and 
● | supply of the drug. 

 
We must reach an agreement with the FDA on the proposed protocols for our future clinical trials in the United States. A separate submission to the FDA must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. Informed consent must also be obtained from each study subject. Regulatory authorities, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
FDA Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements for record-keeping and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain quality processes, manufacturing controls, and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers in order to ensure that the product is safe, has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics that it purports to have. Under the federal Prescription Drug Marketing Act, the sampling and distribution and tracking of drugs is regulated. It is designed to discourage the sale of counterfeit, adulterated, misbranded, subpotent, and expired prescription drugs. Certain states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, fail to approve any NDA or other application, require us to recall a drug from distribution, shut down manufacturing operations or withdraw approval of the NDA for that drug. Noncompliance with cGMP or other requirements can result in issuance of warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures, and injunctive action.

Labeling, Marketing and Promotion
 
The FDA closely regulates the labeling, marketing, and promotion of drugs. While doctors are free to prescribe any drug approved by the FDA for any use, a company can only make claims relating to the safety and efficacy of a drug that are consistent with FDA approval and may only actively market a drug only for the particular use and treatment approved by the FDA. In addition, any claims we make for our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Government regulators recently have increased their scrutiny of the promotion and marketing of drugs.
Pediatric Research Equity Act
 
The Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) amended the FDCA to authorize the FDA to require certain research into drugs used in pediatric patients. The intent of the PREA is to compel sponsors whose drugs have pediatric applicability to study those drugs in pediatric populations, rather than ignoring pediatric indications for adult indications that could be more economically desirable. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may defer or waive these requirements under specified circumstances. The FDA may decide that an NDA will be approved only following completion of additional pediatric studies.
 
Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws
 
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, as amended, the privacy regulations promulgated under HIPAA, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 
In the United States, we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including, but not limited to, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.
 
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to or approval by the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion-dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, the federal civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation.
 
There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, a similar federal requirement Section 6002 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) commonly referred to as the “Physician Payments Sunshine Act” requires manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments and “transfers of value” made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, made in the previous calendar year. There are a number of states that have various types of reporting requirements as well. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state, and soon federal, authorities.
 
Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act
 
In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The fees, discounts, and other provisions of this law are expected to have a significant negative effect on the profitability of pharmaceuticals. This legislation is expected to impact the scope of healthcare insurance, the insurance refunds from the insurance companies and possibly also on the costs of medical products.
Other Regulations
 
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Exchange Act
 
We are subject to the following regulations of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and applicable securities laws, rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act by the SEC. Compliance with these requirements of the Exchange Act increases our legal and accounting costs.
Smaller Reporting Company
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act, and subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting company.” That designation will relieve us of some of the informational requirements of Regulation S-K.

Emerging Growth Company
 
We are also an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or “JOBS Act.” As long as we remain an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not an “emerging growth company,” like those applicable to a “smaller reporting company,” including, but not limited to, a scaled down description of our business in SEC filings; no requirements to include risk factors in Exchange Act filings; no requirement to include certain selected financial data and supplementary financial information in SEC filings; not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements that we file under the Exchange Act; no requirement for Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b) auditor attestations of internal control over financial reporting; and exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We are also only required to file audited financial statements for the previous two fiscal years when filing registration statements, together with reviewed financial statements of any applicable subsequent quarter.
 
We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” We can remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years. We would cease to be an “emerging growth company” prior to such time if we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more and when we become a “larger accelerated filer,” have a public float of $700 million or more or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
 
Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
Sarbanes/Oxley Act
 
Except for the limitations excluded by the JOBS Act discussed under the preceding heading “Emerging Growth Company,” we are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes/Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; management assessment of our internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes/Oxley Act will substantially increase our legal and accounting costs.
 
Exchange Act Reporting Requirements
 
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, like we are, to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to shareholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our shareholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A (where proxies are solicited) or 14C (where consents in writing to the action have already been received or anticipated to be received) of Regulation 14, as applicable; and preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to our shareholders.
 
We are also required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and will be required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
