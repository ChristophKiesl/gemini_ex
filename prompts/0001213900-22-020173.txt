Item 1. Business
Introduction



Sentinel Energy Services Inc. (the “Company”) was formed as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). The Company is also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in the Exchange Act.



The Company was incorporated on June 5, 2017 in the Cayman Islands. On December 28, 2018, the Company changed its jurisdiction of incorporation (the “Domestication”) from the Cayman Islands (“Sentinel Cayman”) to the State of Delaware (“Sentinel Delaware”) and continued to be named Sentinel Energy Services Inc. As a result of the Domestication, the securities of Sentinel Cayman converted into securities of Sentinel Delaware, such that Sentinel Cayman’s issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares (the “Class A ordinary shares”) and Class B ordinary shares (the “Class B ordinary shares”) automatically converted by operation of law into one share of Class A common stock (“Class A common stock”) and Class B common stock (“Class B common stock”), of Sentinel Delaware, respectively. Similarly, each of Sentinel Cayman’s outstanding units and warrants, automatically converted by operation of law, on a one-for-one basis, into Units (defined below) of Sentinel Delaware and warrants, including the Private Placement Warrants and Public Warrants (each as defined below) to acquire the corresponding number of shares of Class A common stock, respectively. All references to the Company’s capital stock both before and after the Domestication are referred to as shares of “common stock” in this filing.



As of December 31, 2021, the Company has not yet commenced operations. All activity through December 31, 2021 related to (1) the Company’s formation and issuance of the Founder Shares in June 2017, (2) the Public Offering and sale of Private Placement Warrants (each as defined below) which closed in November 2017, (3) the subsequent search for a business combination candidate, including activities in connection with the announced and subsequently terminated proposed business combination with Strike Capital, LLC (“Strike”) and (4) liquidation activities following the Company’s inability to consummate a business combination prior to the November 7, 2019 deadline under the Company’s certificate of incorporation (the “Charter”). The Company has not generated any operating revenues since inception. The Company generated non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the Public Offering and sale of Private Placement Warrants until November 2019.



Our management team is led by Andrew Gould, our Chairman, who has more than 42 years’ experience in global energy and related business, and Gerald Cimador, our Chief Financial Officer, who has extensive financial and accounting experience in account and private investment management firms. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to the Public Offering and sale of Private Placement Warrants, the identification and evaluation of prospective acquisition targets for a business combination, and subsequent liquidation activities.



Offerings and Liquidation



The Company intended to finance its initial business combination with proceeds from Company’s initial public offering (the “Public Offering”) of its units (the “Units”), each of which consisted of (A) one share of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Public Shares”), and (B) one-third of one warrant exercisable to purchase one share of the Company’s Class A common stock (each whole warrant, a “Public Warrant”), and from the Company’s private placement sale of warrants exercisable to purchase one share of Company’s Class A common stock (each, a “Private Placement Warrant”) to Sentinel Management Holdings, LLC (the “Sponsor”).

The Public Offering closing occurred in November 2017 for a total of 34,500,000 Units, including Units issued in connection with the exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option in the Public Offering, with gross proceeds of $345 million at a price of $10.00 per Unit. The sale of the Private Placement Warrants also closed in November 2017 for a total of 5,933,333 Private Placement Warrants, including an additional issuance to the Sponsor in connection with the exercise of the underwriter’s overallotment option in the Public Offering, with gross proceeds of approximately $8.9 million at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant.



Following the Public Offering and sale of the Private Placement Warrants, the Company searched for a business to combine with in a transaction that would generate value for the Company’s stockholders. However, over the same period, the energy sector experienced significant headwinds, which increased the challenges faced by the Company in sourcing a compelling target business. Despite the Company’s best efforts, it was not able to consummate a business combination prior to the November 7, 2019 deadline under its Charter. As a result and in accordance with the Charter, the Company commenced the liquidation of the trust account which had a balance of approximately $355.5 million (the “Trust Account”) following a holdback of approximately $1.35 million for Company’s income tax liability for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and dissolution expenses, and returned the funds held therein to its public stockholders by redeeming all of the Public Shares included in the Units at a price of approximately $10.30 per share on November 18, 2019. The Company subsequently made a final distribution of $1,152,035, or approximately $0.03 per former Public Share, on May 4, 2020 following the Company’s payment of its income tax liability of $259,284 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and payment of settlement expenses of $100,351 in connection with the distribution. The Trust Account was subsequently closed with no balance remaining.



In addition, during the liquidation period, the Company and the holders of its Public Warrants executed an amendment to the Warrant Agreement, dated as of November 2, 2017, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, which automatically converted the Public Warrants into the right to receive $0.02 per whole Public Warrant, payable in cash. In December 2019, the Company paid $225,990 to the holders of the Public Warrants in connection with the conversion. The Sponsor forfeited the Private Placement Warrants as a result of the Company being unable to consummate a business combination prior to the deadline in its Charter.



As of December 31, 2021, there are no Units, Public Shares, Public Warrants or Private Placement Warrants outstanding. Additional shares of Class A common stock have been issued and shares of Class B Common stock remain outstanding. For more information, please see “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.”
