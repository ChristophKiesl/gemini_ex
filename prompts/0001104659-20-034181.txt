ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
Broadmark Realty Capital Inc. (“Broadmark Realty” or the “Company”), a Maryland corporation, is an internally managed commercial real estate finance company that that intends to elect to be taxed as real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes. Based in Seattle, Washington, Broadmark Realty offers short-term, first deed of trust loans, secured by real estate to fund the construction and development of, or investment in, residential or commercial properties. Broadmark Realty operates in select states that it believes to have favorable demographic trends and that provide more efficient and quicker access to collateral in the event of borrower default. As of December 31, 2019, Broadmark Realty’s combined portfolio of active loans had approximately $1.1 billion of principal commitments outstanding across 241 loans to over 151 borrowers in twelve states and the District of Columbia, of which approximately $829.0 million was funded.
 
Broadmark Realty has historically funded the growth of its real estate loan portfolio with private capital. In the past, Broadmark Realty has not used debt leverage to finance its loans, and as of December 31, 2019, it has no debt outstanding. As a newly public company, Broadmark Realty plans to opportunistically raise capital in the public market from time to time based on market conditions and to execute on cash management tools to fund the business and produce attractive returns for its stockholders.
 
Properties securing Broadmark Realty’s loans are generally classified as either residential for sale or rent, commercial, horizontal development, or raw land, and are typically not income producing. Each loan is secured by a first mortgage lien on real estate. Broadmark Realty’s lending policy limits the amount of the loan to a maximum loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio of up to 65% of the “as-is” appraised value of the underlying collateral as determined by an independent appraiser at the time of the loan origination. As of December 31, 2019, the average LTV across Broadmark Realty’s active loan portfolio was less than 59% of the most recent appraised value. In addition, each loan is also personally guaranteed on a recourse basis by the principals of the borrower, and/or others at the discretion of Broadmark Realty to further help ensure that Broadmark Realty will receive full repayment of the loan. The guaranty may be collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in the loan or other real estate or assets owned by the guarantor.
 
Broadmark Realty’s loans typically range from $500,000 to $50 million in face value (with an average loan size of approximately $4.9 million at December 31, 2019), generally bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 10% to 13% and have initial terms ranging from five to twelve months in duration (which may be renewed or extended before the expiration of the loan’s term). Broadmark Realty usually receives loan origination fees, or “points,” typically ranging from 4% to 5%, on an annualized basis, of the original principal amount of the loan, along with loan renewal fees, each of which varies in amount based upon, among other things, the term of the loan and the quality of the borrower and the underlying real estate. In addition to loan origination fees and renewal fees, Broadmark Realty receives late fees paid by borrowers, and/or is reimbursed by borrowers for costs associated with services provided by Broadmark Realty, such as closing costs, collection costs on defaulted loans and construction draw inspection fees. Broadmark Realty may charge borrowers exit or prepayment fees.
 
Broadmark Realty’s typical borrowers include real estate investors, developers and other commercial borrowers. It does not lend to owner-occupants of residential real estate. Loan proceeds are generally used to fund the vertical construction, horizontal development, investment, land acquisition, refinancing and, to a lesser extent, renovation and rehabilitation of residential or commercial properties. Broadmark Realty’s loans are generally structured with partial funding at closing and additional loan installments disbursed to the borrower upon satisfactory completion of previously agreed stages of construction.
 
A principal source of new transactions has been repeat business from prior customers and their referral of new business. Broadmark Realty also receives leads for new business from real estate brokers and mortgage brokers, a limited amount of advertising, and through its website.

Broadmark Realty Capital Inc.
 
Broadmark Realty seeks to minimize risk of loss through its underwriting standards. It originates and funds loans secured by first mortgages on residential and commercial real estate located in states that it believes exhibit favorable demographic trends. Broadmark Realty also manages and services its loan portfolio. Broadmark Realty believes that the demand/supply imbalance for residential construction-related real estate loans, presents significant opportunities for it to selectively originate high-quality first mortgage loans on attractive terms.
Markets
 
At December 31, 2019, Broadmark Realty was operating in fourteen states plus the District of Columbia, and its loan portfolio was spread across twelve states plus the District of Columbia, with the majority of loans located in Washington, Colorado, Utah, Texas, Oregon and Idaho (collectively totaling 97.5% of the total face amount of loans as of December 31, 2019). Broadmark Realty strategically focuses on these states as they have exhibited strong population growth – between 2010 and 2019 Washington, Colorado and Texas were in the top ten in the nation for net population migration. Additionally, each of Washington, Colorado, Utah, Texas, Oregon and Idaho are also non-judicial foreclosure states, which we believe provides efficient and prompt access to collateral in the event of borrower default.
 
Broadmark Realty’s loan portfolio is also concentrated within ten counties, the largest being King County, Washington, which comprises the cities of Seattle and Bellevue. As of December 31, 2019, the top ten counties made up 54.6% of the face amount of loans in our total portfolio. Information for the top ten counties, with dollar amounts in millions is as follows:

Business and Growth Strategy
 
Broadmark Realty’s business strategy is to directly originate, fund, manage, and service short-term loans secured by first mortgage liens on real property to enable it to generate attractive returns.

Operations Overview
 
Loan Origination and Due Diligence
 
Broadmark Realty is experienced in secured lending, with significant combined real estate and financial services experience of its senior management team. Broadmark Realty’s senior management team spends a significant portion of its time on borrower development as well as on underwriting and structuring the loans in Broadmark Realty’s portfolio. A principal source of new transactions for Broadmark Realty has been repeat business from existing and former customers and their referral of new business. When underwriting a loan, the primary focus of Broadmark Realty’s analysis is the value of a property. Prior to making a final decision on a loan application Broadmark Realty conducts extensive due diligence of the property as well as the borrower and its principals.
 
The mortgage loans originated by Broadmark Realty generally meet the following criteria:
 

· | Collateral. New loans are secured by a first deed of trust on real estate.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Amount. The amount of Broadmark Realty’s loans typically range from $500,000 to $50 million in face amount with an average loan size at December 31, 2019 of approximately $4.9 million. New loans, together with any outstanding loans, are subject to maximum exposure to a single borrower of no greater than 10% of the total loan portfolio. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Loan to Value. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for a mortgage at origination is 65% of the “as-is” appraised value as confirmed by a third-party appraisal at the time the loan is originated.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Interest rate. A fixed rate between 10% and 13% per annum with a late fee of 10% of the payment outstanding and a default rate of 24% per annum.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Origination fees. Typically ranges from 4% to 5% on an annualized basis. In addition, if the term of the loan is extended, additional points are payable upon the extension.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Term. Typically, five to twelve months. Broadmark Realty may agree to extend the maturity date so long as the borrower complies with all loan covenants, financial and non-financial, and the loan otherwise satisfies Broadmark Realty’s then existing underwriting criteria.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Covenants. To timely pay all taxes, insurance, assessments, and similar charges with respect to the property; to maintain hazard insurance; and to maintain and protect the property.

· | Payment terms. Interest only is payable monthly in arrears. Principal is due in a “balloon” payment at the maturity date. Interest earned from an interest holdback is capitalized in the loans principal balance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Escrow. Generally, none required.
--+----------------------------------


· | Holdbacks. Construction loans typically include a holdback for future construction draws which are funded in arrears following confirmation of work completion. Loans may also include a holdback for interest payments due to a lack of income generated by the real estate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Security. Each loan is evidenced by a promissory note, which is secured by a first mortgage lien on real property owned by the borrower and is personally guaranteed on a recourse basis by the principals of the borrower and/or others, at the discretion of Broadmark Realty, which guaranty may be collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in the borrower or other real estate owned by the guarantor.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fees and Expenses. As is typical in real estate finance transactions, the borrower incurs all expenses in connection with securing the loan, including the cost of a property appraisal, the cost of an environmental assessment report, if any, the cost of a credit report and all title, recording fees and legal fees.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon receipt of a potential borrower’s executed loan application, Broadmark Realty will commence the underwriting process. Before approving and funding a mortgage, Broadmark Realty undertakes extensive due diligence of the borrower, its principals, the guarantor and the property that will be mortgaged to secure the loan. Such due diligence generally includes:
 

· | Borrower and Guarantor Information. Review of a borrower’s credit application, operating agreement or other organizational documents, and review of business and guarantor financial statements and tax returns.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Confirmatory Collateral Information. Review of an independent appraisal report (customarily including market data and analysis and information regarding comparable properties), preliminary title report, tax records, documentation evidencing proper hazard insurance for improved property, and other property information. Loans secured by existing commercial properties require a Phase I environmental site assessment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Project Transaction Information. Review of the property purchase and sale agreement, title insurance, itemized construction budget, building permits, building plans, and specifications and marketing plans and materials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Loan Servicing
 
Broadmark Realty services all of its loans internally, and manages loan payments, draw requests, and loan accounting histories and records. The loan draw process in particular is an important part of Broadmark Realty’s business as it provides borrowers with quick access to capital in order to keep their projects moving and allows Broadmark Realty to inspect the quality and pace of the borrower’s work. Once a borrower has submitted a draw request, Broadmark Realty will have the project inspected to ensure that the work for which funding is being requested has been completed and, in a manner, satisfactory to Broadmark Realty. In addition, any required county and city inspections are completed and lien releases from all vendors and subcontractors are collected before funds are disbursed. Although the process is thorough, Broadmark Realty makes a point of responding to draw requests as quickly as possible as timing is of paramount importance to a project’s success.
 
In addition, Broadmark Realty will conduct periodic testing, process loan payoff requests, and collect past due and delinquent payments. In the case of a loan default, Broadmark Realty has broad authority to take such actions as it believes best in working out the defaulted loan, including selling the defaulted loan or foreclosing on the real property serving as collateral for the loan.

Loan Funding
 
Broadmark Realty’s ability to grow its business is primarily constrained by its ability to raise capital to fund additional real estate loans. Prior to the Business Combination, Broadmark Realty funded loans primarily through the use of private capital. Going forward, Broadmark Realty intends to fund its growth through issuance of common stock, potential use of cash management tools such as a credit facility, and the sale of participation interests in loans to the Private REIT (as described below).
 
Private REIT
 
Broadmark Realty has formed a newly organized real estate finance company, called Broadmark Private REIT, LLC (the “Private REIT”), that primarily participates in short-term, first deed of trust loans secured by real estate to fund the construction and development of, or investment in, residential or commercial properties located in the United States that are originated, underwritten and serviced by a subsidiary of Broadmark Realty. The Private REIT will be managed by Broadmark Private REIT Management, LLC (the “Manager”), a subsidiary of Broadmark Realty. Similar to Broadmark Realty, the Private REIT’s investment objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns primarily through fees and interest income primarily generated from its real estate loan portfolio. The Private REIT expects to elect to qualify as a REIT commencing with its initial taxable year.
 
Broadmark Realty and the Private REIT entered into a Master Loan Participation Agreement (the “Participation Agreement”) pursuant to which a subsidiary of Broadmark Realty expects to sell to the Private REIT participation interests in loans that it originates. Broadmark Realty retains sole authority with respect to whether to permit the Private REIT to participate in any particular loan. Broadmark Realty also retains sole authority with respect to the participation percentage of each loan that the Private REIT will receive. The Private REIT’s participations in Broadmark Realty’s loans will be limited by the amount of the Private REIT’s cash available to lend, as defined. “Cash Available to Lend” is generally defined as cash in excess of the Private REIT’s obligations under existing mortgages or participations therein, including contributions of cash from the admission of new investors and repayments of mortgages or sales of assets, but excluding cash distributable to investors, existing or accrued liabilities, reserves for estimated construction draws and anticipated redemption payments, or write-downs of defaulted mortgages. In the event that the Private REIT has Cash Available to Lend in excess of the loan participation interests offered to it by Broadmark Realty, the Private REIT may originate its own mortgages or purchase mortgages from third parties that are comparable to those originated by Broadmark Realty.
 
The Manager will be compensated with respect to the mortgages initiated by the Private REIT or participations in Broadmark Realty’s mortgages through the Manager’s receipt of 80% of all fee-based income (generally borrower loan fees, including origination points, late fees and extension fees) and 20% of all cash distributable to Private REIT investors in excess of the monthly 0.5% preferred return to investors.
 
The Private REIT intends to make a continuous offering of its preferred units (“Preferred Units”) to eligible investors pursuant to Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”). The initial sale of Preferred Units occurred in March 2020. The Private REIT’s Preferred Units are not and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction. The Manager does not expect that the Private REIT will register as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act pursuant to available exemptions from registration.
 
The Manager is currently not registered and is not required to register as an investment adviser with the SEC or any state securities governing authority in reliance on exemptions available to private fund advisers. The Manager has filed Form ADV with the SEC as an “exempt reporting adviser” and will rely on the exemption from registration under the Advisers Act for certain private fund advisers. See below for further discussion of the Investment Company Act Exemption available to the Manager.

 Regulation and Compliance
 
Broadmark Realty’s operations are subject, in certain circumstances, to supervision and regulation by state and U.S. federal government authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions. In addition, Broadmark Realty and its subsidiaries may rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act, the Investment Company Act, and the Investment Advisers Act. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may, in certain circumstances, depend on compliance by third parties who Broadmark Realty does not control.
Regulation of Commercial Real Estate Lending Activities
 
In general, commercial real estate lending is a highly regulated industry in the United States and Broadmark Realty is required to comply with, among other statutes and regulations, certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans, the USA Patriot Act, regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control, and U.S. federal and state securities laws and regulations. In addition, certain states have adopted laws or regulations that may, among other requirements, require licensing of lenders and financiers, prescribe disclosures of certain contractual terms, impose limitations on interest rates and other charges, and limit or prohibit certain collection practices and creditor remedies. Broadmark Realty is required to comply with the applicable laws and regulations in the states in which it does business.
Investment Company Act Exemption
 
Although Broadmark Realty reserves the right to modify its business methods at any time, it is not currently required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, Broadmark Realty cannot assure you that its business strategy will not evolve over time in a manner that could subject it to the registration requirements of the Investment Company Act.
 
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Excluded from the term “investment securities” are, among other things, securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exclusion from the definition of “investment company” set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.
 
Broadmark Realty conducts operations so that it will not be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Broadmark Realty conducts business primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries. In order for Broadmark Realty to comply with Section 3(a)(1)(C), the securities issued by any wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that are excluded from the definition of “investment company” based on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities that it may own, may not have a value in excess of 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Broadmark Realty will monitor its holdings to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance with this test. Additionally, Broadmark Realty believes it will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because it will not engage primarily, or propose to engage primarily, or hold itself out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. Rather, Broadmark Realty is primarily engaged in the non-investment company business of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Broadmark Realty Capital Inc.
 
Broadmark Realty’s subsidiary that issues and holds the mortgages (the “Mortgage Subsidiary”) qualifies for the exclusion from the definition of “investment company” pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which provides an exclusion for companies engaged primarily in investments in mortgages and other liens on or interests in real estate. To qualify for the exclusion pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C), based on positions set forth by the staff of the SEC, the Mortgage Subsidiary will generally be required to hold at least (i) 55% of its assets in qualifying real estate assets and (ii) at least 80% of its assets in qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets. Provided that the Mortgage Subsidiary is able to maintain this exclusion, Broadmark Realty’s interests in Mortgage Subsidiary will not constitute “investment securities.” Broadmark Realty intends to rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on its analyses of guidance published with respect to which assets are qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets for purposes of Section 3(c)(5)(C).
Competition
 
Real estate lending is a competitive business. Broadmark Realty competes for lending opportunities with a variety of institutional lenders and investors, including other “hard money” lenders, mortgage REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage banks, credit unions, insurance companies, mutual funds, pension funds, private equity real estate funds, hedge funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, non-bank financial institutions, governmental bodies, family offices, and high net worth individuals. New parties continue to enter the market resulting in increased competition and pricing pressure.
 
Broadmark Realty competes on the basis of borrower relationships, product offerings, loan structure, terms, and service. Broadmark Realty’s success depends on its ability to maintain and capitalize on relationships with borrowers and their representatives, offer attractive loan terms and provide superior service.
 
Seasonality
 
While Broadmark Realty typically originates loans year-round, incremental loan disbursements are made with greater frequency during the spring, summer and fall, when weather is generally more favorable for construction, and borrowers complete previously agreed stages of construction, allowing such borrowers to draw down on additional amounts of capital available under their loan agreements. As a result of these more frequent disbursements, Broadmark Realty maintains greater amounts of cash on hand to fund these disbursements during these seasons.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Data
 
Broadmark Realty’s business does not depend on exploiting or leveraging any particular intellectual property rights. To the extent that Broadmark Realty owns any rights to intellectual property, it relies on a combination of registered and state, federal, and common law trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, and trade secret protection. Broadmark Realty currently has an application for registration of the trademark “Broadmark” pending with the United States Patented Trademark Office (USPTO) and has two applications pending with the USPTO for the design of the Broadmark Realty logo.
Employees
 
As of March 1, 2020, Broadmark Realty had 41 employees.
