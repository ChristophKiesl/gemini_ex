Our Strategy
 
IMT and Vislink video brands:
 
Our acquisitions of IMT and Vislink are part of xG’s plan to diversify and grow the broadcast, sports and entertainment and public safety, surveillance and defense markets. They allow us to offer a broad array of end-to-end, high-reliability, high-data rate, long-range wireless video transmission solutions. These solutions are being used for applications in growing market segments, including in-game sports video mobile feeds, real-time capture and display of footage from drones and other aerial platforms, and rapid-response electronic news gathering operations.
 
The key sector strategies for IMT and Vislink are to expand the various markets for existing miniature wireless video products which include educational sectors, videographers, and video service providers, provide complete end-to-end solutions for the video surveillance market, and introduce complete end-to-end IP technology into the broadcast market.

The acquisition of Vislink is expected to offer xG the opportunity to realize synergies with its IMT business unit, while allowing both entities to offer an expanded suite of services and product offerings in the markets they are already active in. A key advantage is that there is currently limited overlap in product offerings, sales channels and market coverage between the two companies. For example, Vislink has a substantial client base in international markets where IMT has had a limited presence. In addition, IMT has a very strong product portfolio targeted to US federal law enforcement and high-end sports broadcasting customers who will now have access to additional solutions based on Vislink’s product configurations. Finally, Vislink has traditionally focused on licensed spectrum solutions where IMT has pioneered the use of non-licensed spectrum for many applications. Combining xG’s shared spectrum and interference mitigation techniques with an expanded IMT/Vislink product lineup will provide an opening into additional customer bases that currently do not have access to licensed spectrum.

xMax:
 
For xMax, our strategy is to leverage elements of our intellectual property portfolio to introduce a range of spectrum agnostic, cognitive radio network solutions for numerous industries and applications. We believe that sales of these xMax-branded products and services, together with our ability to leverage our patent portfolio, present us with an attractive revenue model. Our future strategies are for our intellectual property to be embedded by partners in a semiconductor chip that could be sold to third-party equipment manufacturers and inserted in their devices, and to license our intellectual property to other customers in industry verticals worldwide.
 
We believe the xMax system represents the only commercially available cognitive radio network system that includes purpose-built interference mitigation. xMax implements our proprietary interference mitigation software that can increase capacity on already crowded airwaves by improving interference tolerance, enabling the delivery of a comparatively high quality of service where other technologies would not be able to cope with the interference.
 
The xMax system allows mobile operators to utilize free, unlicensed 902 – 928 MHz ISM band spectrum (which spectrum is available in all of the Americas except French Guiana) instead of purchasing scarce, expensive licensed spectrum. Our xMax system will also enable enterprises to set up a mobile communications network in an expeditious and cost-effective manner. Although currently designed to operate within the 902 − 928 MHz unlicensed band of spectrum, our system is frequency agnostic.

xMax:
 
The key market sectors that rely on communications systems that have mission-critical capabilities are public safety/emergency management and defense.
 
In emergency management operations, reliable communications are an absolute requirement and cannot be compromised by interference, network contention or congestion from other users, or lack of coverage or reliability. Public safety workers cannot lose voice communications in times of emergency or at large public gatherings. On the other hand, many police and fire organizations are using public cellular or WiFi networks for data communications.
 
With the onset of body-worn cameras and the use of tablet computers instead of paper forms, data communications are becoming just as critical as voice communications. When they rely on public commercial networks, data communications are susceptible to overload during large public events as well as when emergency situations and disaster-based outages take place. Public data access based on commercial cellular also incurs significant monthly charges per user. WiFi or other unlicensed networks are considered unreliable due to the public availability and allowing anyone to construct a network anywhere without coordination with existing users.
 
The xMax System was specifically engineered to deliver voice, video, and data communications in crisis environments. The public safety community can benefit from the following features that the xMax cognitive radio network offers:
 

· | Works with common-off-the-shelf (COTS) smartphones and smart devices
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-----------------------------------------


· | Can enable effective operation in FREE, unlicensed spectrum
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | Integrates with legacy systems
--+-------------------------------


· | Cost-effective ongoing operations
--+----------------------------------

 
In military applications, wireless communications systems must meet or exceed performance parameters that few other communications systems can tolerate. The systems must be extremely mobile, almost infinitely scalable, frequency agile, cost-efficient and have highly flexible deployment schemes. In addition, the systems must be able to securely integrate commercial smartphones and tablets at the tactical edge of operations. And, critically, they must be able to maintain communications integrity in the face of unpredictable RF challenges.
 
In military wireless communications scenarios, xMax can fulfill the requirements of military wireless communications planners thanks to the following attributes:
 

· | A fully expeditionary communications network that supports voice, video, and broadband data over one set of hardware.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Exceptionally low probability of jamming or hacking. Patented active interference mitigation technologies make the system resistant to jamming and hacking attempts, with a very low chance of message interception, even in the most unpredictable spectrum conditions.

xMax:

xMax is the flagship implementation of xG’s innovative cognitive radio intellectual property. Operating initially within the 902 – 928 MHz license-free band, xMax is a mobile voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) and broadband data system that utilizes an end-to-end IP system architecture. xMax technology is spectrum agnostic. In any spectrum band that xMax operates in, we break the band into channels and sub channels. We then use spatial processing and adaptive modulation to mitigate interference in that band. If the band becomes unusable because of overwhelming interference, we then use dynamic spectrum access to change to another channel or band. The xMax product suite we currently sell is band-specific due to the current limitations in RF technology that can be produced for a given size, cost and complexity. Multiband, small, portable devices today require custom developed integrated circuits, which are on our technology roadmap, but not currently available. 
 
The xMax system design represents a turnkey network solution that includes rapid-deploy self-organizing access points (base stations), fixed and mobile personal Wi-Fi hotspots, mobile switching centers, as well as network management and deployment tools. A key feature of the xMax system is the ability to leverage off-the-shelf commercial mobile devices (such as smartphones, laptops and tablets), resulting in reduced network infrastructure, maintenance and operational costs. The xMax system allows operation in the free, unlicensed 902 – 928 MHz ISM band spectrum (available in most of the Americas) instead of having to purchase scarce licensed spectrum which can be prohibitively expensive.

When implemented, Self-Organizing Networking (SON) technology will simplify and speed deployment for commercial, private and tactical networks.
 
The CN1100 Access Point is a small, single channel device that provides voice, data and video over ranges of 1 to 5 miles (non-line-of-sight) and up to 15 miles (line-of-sight), depending on environmental and installation conditions. The xMax system is designed so that it is possible to collocate multiple CN1100 Access Points in order to increase system capacity. CN1100 Access Points are GPS time-synchronized to avoid self-interference, which increases overall system capacity and load leveling. These features, along with deterministic Media Access Control (MAC) for high-quality voice calls, give the xMax system improved scalability in real-world conditions.
 
Having numerous accessible channels allows neighboring network nodes (made up of one or more CN1100 Access Points) to utilize non-interfering channels automatically when employing the network self-planning features that are in our technology roadmap. This will allow the network to grow and scale more easily without the operator having to redesign the network RF plan each time a device moves, or when CN1100 Access Points or users are added or removed from the network.

Competition and Competitive Positioning

The primary competitors of IMT and Vislink are Domo Tactical Communications (Formerly a division of Cobham), Silvus Technologies, Persistent Systems, Troll Systems and a number of smaller market- specific businesses.
 
The union of the IMT and Vislink entities created the market share leader in the professional broadcast and media video transmission sector. We believe that their products solve a growing market need for stable, high-definition, wireless video communications. Separately, IMT and Vislink have been able to successfully leverage their long broadcast industry leadership, reputations for advanced technology, and ability to provide end-to-end-solutions in order to maintain and increase their customer bases and to continue providing highly competitive offerings. Both companies have mature product offerings that address applications in growing market segments, including in-game sports video mobile feeds, real-time capture and display of footage from drones and other aerial platforms, and rapid-response electronic news gathering operations.
 
As the businesses are integrated, it is expected that these advantages will be further strengthened. Because there is currently minimal overlap in product offerings between IMT and Vislink, we believe there will now be the opportunity to offer an expanded range of product offerings, additional services and enhanced capabilities. This positions us well for continued growth in broadcast and sports and entertainment markets, and we expect near term growth in the government/surveillance market. As we realize full control of the production processes of the two firms, we expect to be able to realize improving margins, control over product quality and competitive agility.
 
With respect to xMax, the wireless technology sector is intensely competitive and is rapidly evolving. Several vendors have researched and experimented with cognitive radios. This research predominately falls under the traditional industry defined use of a cognitive radio where cognitive capabilities are restricted to dynamic spectrum access (“DSA”) within the radio device. However, we believe that only a few vendors are undertaking development across all the key elements of cognitive technology: spectrum sensing, spectrum management, spectrum mobility, spectrum sharing, and spatial processing.
 
We not only face competition from other companies developing cognitive radio solutions but we are also competing for sales to end-user customers with companies offering solutions utilizing other technologies for access to licensed and unlicensed spectrum, such as LTE and Wi-Fi. In the cognitive radio market, our competitors include, Neul Ltd., Shared Spectrum Corporation and Adaptrum.
 
The main vendor in the public safety market is Motorola Solutions, which is a global player that holds a highly dominant market share in the U.S. of over 80% in public safety and government wireless networks. Meanwhile, in the defense market, there are several large and significant companies that provide wireless communications systems to U.S. and international military agencies, including Harris Corporation, ITT Industries, Raytheon, Boeing, Thales Communications and Lockheed Martin. It is common for one competitor to be a subcontractor to another competitor who is the prime contractor and vice versa as programs of record ramp up and ramp down over time.
 
A number of our current or potential competitors have long operating histories, significant brand recognition, large customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. We believe that xMax possesses the following key features that together constitute a competitive advantage to alternatives in the market:
 
xMax competitive positioning:
 
Mobility and Rapid Deployability — we have developed our product line to support mobility and rapid deployability. xMax has been designed with the ability to automatically perform its own RF planning by utilizing an extended range of non-interfering channels without manual intervention. This allows for the rapid deployment of communications assets which is often essential in the establishment of critical communications infrastructures. It also provides the ability to make the entire network infrastructure mobile, with CN1100 Access Point base stations able to move in relation to each other as well as to CN5100 Mobile Hotspots, CN3200 Dual-Band Routing Modems, xMax CN3100 Vehicle Modems and users. We believe this feature will be unique to xMax and will address a major capability gap for defense, homeland security, and public safety agencies which all require “on the move” communications networks. These agencies currently have no equipment or capacity for this identified and urgently needed capability.
Unique Product Architecture — The all-IP architecture on which xMax is based allows end-users to access the network with any IP-enabled device such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops while using their preferred software including VPNs and other security applications. We believe this can reduce costs by eliminating the need for expensive proprietary end-user devices and applications, while freeing users from the constraints of public cellular networks.
 
Exceptional Flexibility — xMax can serve as either a fixed, mobile, portable, or aerial wireless infrastructure, making it ideal for a number of deployment scenarios. These include emergency response, public safety and defense where communications must often be established quickly in remote areas, as well as for utilities and other critical infrastructure operations. 
 
High level of interoperability — Although xMax operates as a self-contained communications infrastructure, it is interoperable with both public and private systems including P25, PSTN, cellular networks, and the forthcoming FirstNet nationwide public safety communications network.

Interference mitigation — Whereas most competitors’ efforts to date focus on interference avoidance, we have extended our core competency into the realm of interference mitigation. In a world where wireless demand is certain to result in more, not less, congested airwaves, we believe that our intellectual property that can help to ameliorate interference is a unique competitive advantage in the marketplace.
 
 We believe we compete favorably on these factors. However, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. Other developers could develop alternative wireless cognitive networks and other technologies that may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers. These competitors may include companies of which we may not be currently aware.
 
With respect to our xG Federal Group, we believe that the growing need for wireless spectrum among public and private users will continue to drive interest in technology-based spectrum sharing approaches, such as cognitive radio and opportunistic (i.e. shared) spectrum use. In fact, a number of federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Energy, have ongoing research and development activities in the area of spectrum sharing. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) supported early research into cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum access, and it continues to address key problem areas in spectrum sharing for military systems. Leveraging elements of our intellectual property portfolio and technological foundation in areas including interference mitigation, cognitive radios and interference mitigation and multiple in, multiple out (“MIMO”) antenna technology, we believe we are well-placed to identify, respond to, and secure funded spectrum sharing research opportunities.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales team currently is comprised of sales managers responsible for defined regional areas, inside sales personnel, and business development representatives focused on targeted sectors and/or regions. They are supported by solution engineers trained in technical sales with given market focus. This sales team is focused on supporting our current customers, as well as nurturing relationships with prospective customers in key domestic and international markets. For our IMT, Vislink and xMax brands, we employ a combination of sales channels, including direct-to-end customer sales, network group sales, reseller/integrators and OEM sales channels in order to use the most efficient means of reaching customers depending on the market segment. Sales efforts are supported by marketing and public relations activities, digital and print marketing initiatives, the creation of support materials, and trade show and other event appearances.
 
Our sales and support personnel are actively involved in the development of sales presentation materials and training of our channel partner sales personnel to assist them in marketing our services, either directly or indirectly to their customers. We also directly train and support selected key customers and technology providers in order to grow an active client base and solidify relationships.
 
As of December 31, 2016, our business development, sales and marketing team consisted of 11 full-time employees or contractors.
 
Customers
 
Our IMT and Vislink entities have developed significant followings based on their reputation for product performance, reliability and use of advanced technology. Both have developed diverse and stable customer bases for repeat product purchases from blue chip, tier-1 clients in the Broadcasting and Sports and Entertainment markets, as well as among high-profile agencies and organizations in Surveillance (Military and Government) markets.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
We have historically retained contract manufacturers to manufacture, test, assure the quality of, and ship our products. With the acquisitions of IMT and Vislink, we have additional options for both internal and external manufacturing of products. This provides us the opportunity to develop optimal supply chains that are tailored to our needs on a per-product and per-solution basis. Going forward, we anticipate that we will focus on our core strengths, which are innovation and technology design and the development, creation and exploitation of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we ultimately plan to become a designer, developer and fabless supplier of xMax integrated circuits and system software solutions for xMax products where we would supply integrated circuits produced either through the IMT and Vislink assets, if we are able to successfully integrate them into our business, or by third party manufacturing partners under license, software, reference designs, features, tools and technical support.
 
While we intend to integrate IMT and Vislink into our plan to build our products, but may continue to rely, particularly in the short term, on third party components and technology to build our products, as we procure components, subassemblies and products necessary for the manufacture of our products based upon our design, development and production needs. While components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources, we currently depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for several components for our products. We are using a single source digital signal processor that may be difficult to replace with an equivalent performance device. We rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with our suppliers. We do not currently stockpile enough components to mitigate any potential supply disruption if we are required to re-engineer our products to use alternative components.

We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We also actively engage in monitoring activities with respect to infringing uses of our intellectual property by third parties.
 
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, trade dress, domain name and patents to protect our products and other intellectual property. We typically own the copyright to our software code, as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our products are marketed. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in locations outside the United States. Our registered trademarks in the United States include “xG”, and “xMax”, “IMT”, “Vislink”, the names of our products, among others.
 
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which our products are sold or distributed. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. In addition, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business, thereby harming our operating results.
 
Companies in the mobile wireless communications technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We may face allegations by third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities, that we have infringed their trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights. As our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
