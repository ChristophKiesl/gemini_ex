ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview and Strategy
 
LifeMD is a direct-to-patient telehealth company that provides a smarter, cost-effective and convenient way of accessing healthcare. We believe the traditional model of visiting a doctor’s office, receiving a physical prescription, visiting a local pharmacy, and returning to see a doctor for follow up care or prescription refills is inefficient, costly to patients, and discourages many patients from seeking much needed medical care. The U.S. healthcare system is undergoing a paradigm shift, thanks to new technologies and the emergence of direct-to-patient healthcare. Direct-to-patient telemedicine companies, like our company, connect consumers to licensed healthcare professionals for care across numerous indications, including concierge care, men’s sexual health and dermatology, among others.
 
Our telemedicine platform helps patients access licensed providers for diagnoses, virtual care, and prescription medications, often delivered on a recurring basis. In addition to our telemedicine offerings, we sell nutritional supplements and other over-the-counter products. Many of our products are available on a subscription or membership basis, where a patient can subscribe to receive regular shipments of prescribed medications or products. This creates convenience and often discounted pricing opportunities for patients and recurring revenue streams for us. Our patient acquisition strategy combines strategic brand-building media placements and direct response advertising methods across highly scalable marketing channels (i.e. national TV, streaming TV, streaming audio, podcast, print, magazines, online search, social media, and digital).
 
Since inception, we have helped more than 300,000 customers and patients, providing them greater access to high-quality, convenient, and affordable care in all 50 states. Our telemedicine revenue increased 208% in 2020 vs. the prior year. Total revenue from recurring subscriptions is approximately 80%. In addition to our telehealth business, we own 85.6% of PDFSimpli, a rapidly growing SaaS platform for converting, signing, editing and sharing PDF documents. This business has also seen 165% year over year growth, with recurring revenue of 100%.

Many people can relate to the hassle and inconvenience of seeking medical care. We believe that telemedicine platforms like ours will fundamentally shift how patients access healthcare in the U.S., by necessity and by preference. With the average wait time to see a physician in the U.S. now at greater than 29 days, according to a 2018 Merritt Hawkins Survey, and the U.S. projected to have a significant shortfall of licensed physicians by 2030, we believe the U.S. healthcare infrastructure must change to accommodate patients. Timely and convenient access to healthcare and prescription medications is a critical factor in improving quality of care and patient outcomes. Our mission is to radically change healthcare with our portfolio of direct-to-patient telehealth brands that encompass on-demand medical treatment, online pharmacy and over-the-counter products. We want our brands to be top-of-mind for consumers considering telehealth.
 
In the United States, healthcare spending is currently $4.0 trillion and is expected to grow to $6.2 trillion by 2028, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Physician services and prescription medications account for approximately 30% of healthcare spending, or over $1 trillion annually, and we believe that we have the infrastructure, medical expertise, and technical know-how to shift a substantial portion of this market to an online, virtual format. Our platforms are fast and convenient, and we believe the adoption of our services has increased rapidly because of these features, including lower out-of-pocket costs for patients and the satisfaction of a simple healthcare process. We believe the opportunities are immense and that we are well positioned to capitalize on these large scale economic shifts in healthcare.
 
We believe that brand innovation, customer acquisition and service excellence form the heart of our business. As is exemplified with our first brand, Shapiro MD, we have built a full line of proprietary OTC products for male and female hair loss, FDA approved OTC minoxidil, an FDA-cleared medical device, and now a personalized telemedicine offering that gives consumers access to virtual medical treatment and, when appropriate, a full line of oral and topical prescription medications for hair loss. Our men’s telemedicine brand, Rex MD, currently offers treatment for erectile dysfunction, and will soon offer treatments for additional indications present in men’s health. We have built a platform that allows us to efficiently launch telehealth and wellness product lines wherever we determine there is a market need. Our platform is supported by a driven team of digital marketing and branding experts, data analysts, designers, and engineers focused on building enduring brands.
 
Our Brand Portfolio
 
We have built a strategic portfolio of wholly-owned telehealth brands that address large unmet needs in men’s health, hair loss and dermatology. We also are preparing to launch a concierge care offering under the LifeMD brand. We continue to scale our offerings in a calculated manner, ensuring that each brand or indication we launch will enhance current and future patients’ experiences with our platform.
 
Our process across each brand and condition that we treat is to guide the patient through a medical intake process and product selection, after which a licensed U.S. physician within our network conducts a virtual consultation and, if appropriate, prescribes necessary prescription medications and/or recommends over-the-counter products. Prescription and over the counter products are filled by pharmacy fulfillment partners and shipped directly to the patient. The number of patients and customers we serve across the nation continues to increase at a robust pace, with more than 300,000 individuals having purchased our products and services to date.
 
Hair Loss: ShapiroMD
 
Launched in 2017, ShapiroMD offers virtual medical treatment, prescription medications, patented over-the-counter products, and an FDA approved medical device for male and female hair loss. ShapiroMD has emerged as a leading destination for hair loss treatment across the U.S. and has had more than 200,000 customers and patients since inception. In Q1 2021, ShapiroMD greatly enhanced its telemedicine offering for female hair loss with the addition of topical compounded medications to its product portfolio.
 
On February 21, 2020, ConsumersAdvocate.org ranked ShapiroMD as the third best hair loss treatment provider in the United States, ahead of other household brands such as Bosley, Keeps and Rogaine.

Men’s Health: RexMD
 
Launched in 2019, RexMD is a men’s telehealth brand offering virtual medical treatment from licensed providers for a variety of Men’s health needs. After consultation with a physician, if appropriate, we dispense and ship prescription medications and over-the-counter products directly to patients. We initially launched in the erectile dysfunction treatment market. We intend to expand beyond the Sexual health market and launch additional treatment areas in Men’s health in the first half of 2021. Our vision for RexMD is to become a leading telehealth destination for men.
 
We intend to launch additional indications for many other Men’s health conditions in the first half of 2021. Our vision for RexMD is to become a leading telehealth destination for Men’s health.


Dermatology: NavaMD
 
Launching in the first quarter of 2021, Nava MD is a female-oriented tele-dermatology and skincare brand that will offer virtual medical treatment from dermatologists and other providers, and, if appropriate, prescription oral and compounded topical medications to treat many common dermatological conditions. In addition to the brand’s telemedicine offerings, NavaMD’s proprietary products leverage intellectual property and proprietary formulations licenseed from Restorsea, a leading medical grade skincare technology platform.
 
Restoresea’s clinically proven skincare technology platform is the result of more than $50 million invested in R&D and intellectual property development and has received 35 patents along with broad industry and academic acclaim, with its breakthrough clinical results having been published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Drugs in Dermatology and Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology. Nava MD will be one the first direct-to-consumer product lines to offer this advanced skincare technology. Nava MD will be positioned as an online skincare and telehealth brand that will offer tele-dermatology services to patients in 47 states.
 
Immune Health: iNR Wellness MD
 
Launched in 2018, iNR Wellness MD is a supplement for immune and digestive support. The iNR Wellness product line is a daily nutritional supplement that contains yeast, oat, and mushroom beta glucans.
 
Majority Owned Subsidiary: PDFSimpli
 
PDFSimpli is an online software-as-a-service (SAAS) platform that allows users to create, edit, convert, sign and share PDF documents. PDFSimpli was acquired through the purchase of 51% of the membership interests of LegalSimpli Software, LLC, a Puerto Rico limited liability company, which operates a marketing-driven software solutions business. As of December 30, 2020, PDFSimpli was ranked in the top 4,339 websites globally, in which it was also ranked in the top 1,200 for specific countries with more than 9.5 million registrants globally. Since its launch, PDFSimpli has converted or edited over 9 terabytes of documents for customers from the legal, financial, real-estate and academic sectors. PDFSimpli had over 62,600 active subscriptions as of December 30, 2020.
Customers
 
Our customer base includes men and women seeking hair loss treatment and men’s health issues. In 2021, we expect to broaden this customer base to also include skincare and dermatology products for men and women as well as concierge medicine services. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Industry Overview and Market Opportunity
 
We are focused on revolutionizing the way that patients access healthcare to positively impact their long-term health and satisfaction. In the United States, healthcare spending is currently $4.0 trillion and is expected to grow to $6.2 trillion by 2028, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Despite this growing spend, the existing healthcare system is fragmented and inefficient, lacks price transparency, and is generally unfriendly to the consumer. In addition, a myriad of issues related to insurance coverage and other cost barriers stand in the way of many Americans getting the treatment they need in a timely and efficient manner. Patients are at the mercy of a multitude of gatekeepers at every level – with the service provider, in acquiring medication, and in the insurance reimbursement process – leading to confusion and frustration for consumers. A 2018 Journal of Patient Experience paper found that among 9,166 patients surveyed through the national Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Database, only 28% of respondents rated their satisfaction with their healthcare experience as “optimal;” 61% of respondents rated their satisfaction as “average;” and 11% said “poor.”
 
We believe that telehealth platforms like LifeMD will fundamentally shift how patients think about and access healthcare in the U.S. – by necessity and by preference. With the average wait time to see a physician in the U.S. now >29 days according to a 2018 Merritt Hawkins Survey and the U.S. projected to have a significant shortfall of licensed physicians by 2030, the U.S. healthcare infrastructure must change to accommodate patients. At the same time, consumers are ready for better options.

We believe we are in the early stages of the digitization of healthcare; additionally, telehealth’s adoption has been rapidly expedited by the emergence of the global coronavirus pandemic. Doctors across the U.S. were forced to close offices and adopt telehealth in short order as the novel coronavirus took hold of the U.S. in 2020. Telehealth, and, more specifically, direct-to-consumer telehealth, has since cemented itself as a mainstream way to access healthcare. A July 2020 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that 43.5% of Medicare primary care visits were provided via telehealth in April 2020, an increase from less than 0.5% in February of that year prior to the onset of regional stay-at-home restrictions.
 
Telehealth’s novel approach to offering convenient healthcare helps bridge many of the inefficiencies that plague the U.S. healthcare system today. Telehealth enables more efficient allocation and utilization of existing clinical resources that might otherwise go unused. With an aging population requiring more complex care and a younger generation that is accustomed to digital technology, telehealth offers an efficient way to leverage finite resources. A Journal of General Internal Medicine article from 2016 evaluated patient satisfaction with U.S. telehealth services in comparison to in-office visits: between 94% and 99% of survey respondents reported being “very satisfied” with all telehealth attributes, and over 70% of respondents would use telehealth again and would recommend telehealth to someone else.
 
The shift to Direct-to-Patient telehealth is in its nascent stage, and we believe we have developed the internal infrastructure, medical expertise, and industry know-how to capitalize on the opportunity to penetrate this large, open, and growing market. Physician services and prescription medications account for approximately 30% of healthcare spending, over $1 trillion annually, and according to a market study by Alliance Bernstein in 2018, 70% of the retail prescription drug market will shift online within the next 5 years, a $200 billion economic shift. The broader global telemedicine market is projected to grow at a 19.3% CAGR through 2026.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
We have achieved rapid growth since our transformation into a healthcare focused company in 2018, with a compounded annual growth rate in revenue of nearly 100% since 2018 and growth accelerating to 208% in 2020 as compared to 2019. We believe this validates our significant long-term investments in developing our human capital, technology, brand-awareness, operations and customer acquisition. Our continued investment in, and expansion of our core brands and their offerings will further increase opportunities to acquire new customers and increase the lifetime value of our customers.
 
We continue to invest heavily in the experience our customers have with our products and their overall satisfaction with our products and our company, and we expect customer repurchase rates and overall customer retention to grow further as we allocate more resources and focus to this component of the business. While we are proud of our accomplishments to date, we believe the most exciting opportunities for our growth story are ahead of us, and we intend to pursue the following strategies to help us achieve this growth.
 
Continue to Grow Our Market Share in Indications We Already Treat 
 
There remains a large and unaddressed market within hair-loss, erectile dysfunction, Men’s health, and dermatology into which we intend to aggressively scale in 2021 and beyond. We plan to continue to build a robust operational infrastructure to enable us to not only provide better patient care but drive better unit economics for our business.
Launch New Treatments
 
We intend to leverage our existing infrastructure to launch new products within and around our existing brands. In the first quarter 2021, we are launching our dermatology and skincare brand, NavaMD. Additionally, a multitude of opportunities exist to expand our product offerings under our current brand portfolio, and we plan to deploy new products and services in 2021 and beyond that will meet the needs of our existing customer base. In men’s health, for example, we intend to address ED-adjacent indications including common sexually transmitted infections (STI).

Launch and Scale LifeMD Concierge Care
 
We intend to launch LifeMD, our cash-pay subscription-based concierge care service, in the first half of 2021. We believe that LifeMD will make virtual and on-demand concierge healthcare available at a price that is affordable to almost anyone. We intend to offer our LifeMD concierge service to our existing patient population, new patients that we acquire for condition-specific treatment, and plan to run national and global direct-response marketing campaigns to rapidly increase awareness of the LifeMD offering.
Pursue Opportunities for Joint Ventures, Partnerships, and Inorganic Growth Initiatives 
 
We believe that our business model – direct-to-patient telemedicine – will be disruptive to the world of traditional healthcare services, pharmaceutical products, medical devices, and diagnostics. Our proven ability to launch and scale telemedicine offerings in a capital-efficient manner will likely be valuable to organizations in the traditional healthcare market segment seeking to take advantage of this new delivery model. We believe we are well-positioned to form joint ventures and partnerships with existing traditional healthcare companies, and we are currently exploring avenues and partners for new ventures.
Drive Continued Operational Excellence
 
We are committed to improving productivity and profitability through a number of operational initiatives designed to grow our revenue and expand our margins. Overall, we expect that business profitability will be driven by continued net revenue growth in conjunction with gross margin improvements, continued marketing efficiencies, and generating operating leverage. We believe there is opportunity for continued improvement in gross margins, marketing efficiencies, and operating leverage through these key initiatives:
Optimize Price
 
Through investment in human capital and technology, we intend to continue building a data-based understanding of price elasticity dynamics, promotional strategies and other price management tools to drive optimized pricing for us and our partners. Based on the strength of our brands and the value proposition of our products, we believe we have pricing power in the market that will only increase through economies of scale.
Reduce Product Returns
 
We continue to evolve our return policies and believe we have the opportunity to reduce customer return rates. We have identified several opportunities that span policy change, process improvement and consumer education to reduce return rates and increase overall customer satisfaction.
Invest in Supply Chain
 
We plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to meet the requirements of our growing business. Our supply chain is instrumental to both supporting growth and improving business performance. While we currently partner with a number of third-party manufacturing and logistics companies, physician networks, and prescription medication fulfillment companies, we are evaluating opportunities to build our own internal capabilities in these areas.
 
We anticipate that growth of our products and services will span entirely new markets in healthcare, including:
 
● Services and Content: We plan to offer services that provide customers the opportunity to interact with telemedicine in new ways, including digital apps, counseling and family consultations.
 
● Use Cases: We believe we can broaden the range of use cases addressed by market need, including the treatment of new conditions with the launch of new brands, including our first quarter 2021 launch of NavaMD, and the expansion of existing brand offerings to covering complementary clinical indications.

Competition
 
The markets we sell into are large and highly competitive. Numerous online brands compete with us for customers throughout the U.S. and internationally in the hair loss, immune support, men’s health and document management verticals. We also compete with traditional mass merchandisers, drug store chains, independent pharmacies and health food stores.
 
Our competitors include, among others, Teledoc, Ro, Thirty Madison, Inc., Icebreaker Health, Inc., Hims & Hers Health, Inc. and GoodRx, Inc. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and more experienced than us, have longer operating histories, higher visibility and brand recognition and have materially greater financial and other resources than us. We may not be able to successfully compete with them in the marketplace.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We take a patient-focused approach to telemedicine, with an emphasis on the quality-of-care we deliver to our patients. Our human capital and know-how, proprietary technology platform, and unique product offerings represent meaningful strengths that we believe will enable us to maintain and grow our market-leading position in the U.S.
 
Our key competitive strengths include:
 
High-Quality Care
 
Our telemedicine platform is designed to give consumers more control over their healthcare spending; greater convenience in how and when they pursue or receive care; and better outcomes as hurdles to healthcare services are removed for the care or medications patients need. We are committed to exceptional care and an exceptional customer service experience for our patients and customers.
 
Direct-To-Consumer Know-How
 
We actively seek to acquire, license, and develop brands and products with large, untapped e-commerce potential and proven business models. We acquire our patients in an efficient manner through an omni-channel marketing approach that includes digital advertising through platforms like Facebook and Google, social media platforms, as well as more traditional media channels like television and radio. Since our inception in 2015, we have invested heavily in recruiting experts in direct response marketing and customer acquisition.
 
Proprietary and Scalable Technology Platform
 
Our in-house telemedicine infrastructure is continually being improved as we scale, and this flexible infrastructure can be repurposed for any variety of existing or future telemedicine brands. This flexible platform allows for rapid development and scale of new telemedicine brands as we identify attractive specialty verticals. Additional key capabilities of this platform include proprietary staffing algorithms for case-load balancing, full CRM functionality, synchronous and asynchronous communications, and more.
 
● Patient Care Center : We launched a dedicated patient care center in November 2020 staffed by LifeMD employees which currently spans approximately 100 employees and is led by an experienced operations and customer experience leader. We believe the hands-on capabilities of the patient care center will continue to add significantly to our company’s performance through increased conversions, customer ratings and retention.
 
● Drive Marketing Efficiencies: Marketing investments are the result of a disciplined process and are measured against both growth and profitability targets. As we continue to grow and scale, we believe we will continue to improve the efficiency of our marketing investments and improve our return on advertising spend. As our budgets and pool of talent continues to grow, we believe this will result in cheaper media rates and improvements to our proprietary models that inform the strategic decisions that drive product offerings, customer acquisition, retention, and brand awareness.

Management Team
 
Our management team has deep experience in healthcare services, technology, and direct-to-consumer and traditional advertising such that we believe we are uniquely positioned to expand our patient-base while providing quality services and product offerings at efficient customer-acquisition costs.
Intellectual Property
 
We regard our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and we rely on trademark and copyright law, trade-secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain proprietary rights, technologies or copyrighted materials from third-parties and we rely on those third-parties to defend their proprietary rights, copyrights and technologies.
 
From time-to-time, we register our principal brand names in the United States and certain foreign countries. Our material trademarks include ShapiroMD® and iNRWellnessMD®. Trademark applications are in process for RexMD and SOSRx. The steps we take to protect our proprietary rights in our brand names may not be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of our brand names in the United States or abroad. Existing trademark laws afford only limited practical protection for our product lines. The laws and the level of enforcement of such laws in certain foreign countries where we market our products often do not protect our proprietary rights in our products to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
 
We rely primarily on proprietary trade secrets and extensive experience to operate our online direct response marketing platform. We have two U.S. patents relating to our Shapiro MD products’ method for treatment of hair loss with a combination of natural ingredients with one granted on March 24, 2015 and the other on January 3, 2017. In order to protect the confidentiality of our intellectual property, including trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary technical and business information, it is our policy to limit access to such information to those who require access in order to perform their functions and to enter into agreements with employees, consultants and vendors to contractually protect such information.
 
Manufacturing
 
We use third parties to manufacture and package our products according to the formulas and packaging guidelines we dictate. In order to minimize costs, we may elect to purchase raw or bulk materials directly from our suppliers and have them shipped to our manufacturers so that we may incur only tableting, encapsulating and/or packaging costs and avoid the additional costs associated with purchasing the finished product.
 
We have not experienced any material adverse effect on our business as a result of shortages of raw materials or packaging materials used in the manufacturing of our products. An unexpected interruption or a shortage in supply could adversely affect our business derived from these products. We are not substantially dependent on any raw material supplier or packaging supplier since alternative sources of materials, with equal quality, could be quickly obtained if any of our current suppliers cease to supply us adequately.
 
Government and Environmental Regulation
 
Our business is heavily regulated by the FDA and the FTC. The FDA enforces the FDCA and Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (“DSHEA”) as they pertain to foods, food ingredients, cosmetics and dietary supplement production and marketing. Dietary supplements are regulated as a category of food, not as drugs. We are not required to obtain FDA pre-market approval to sell our products in the United States under current laws. Our hair loss and scarring products are regulated as cosmetics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
 
The FDA imposes GMP guidelines to ensure that dietary supplements are produced in a quality manner, do not contain contaminants or impurities and are accurately labeled. GMPs include requirements for establishing quality control procedures, designing and constructing manufacturing plants, testing ingredients and finished products and record keeping and handling of consumer product complaints. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal law applicable to dietary supplements and cosmetics, including the power to monitor claims made in product labeling, to seize adulterated or misbranded products or unapproved new drugs, to request product recall, to enjoin further manufacture or sale of a product, to issue warning letters and to institute criminal proceedings.

----

 

Advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy of products are also regulated by the FTC. The FTC regulates the advertising of dietary supplements, cosmetics and other health-related products to ensure that any advertising is truthful and not misleading, and that an advertiser maintains adequate substantiation for all product claims. FTC enforcement actions may result in consent decrees, cease and desist orders, judicial injunctions and the payment of fines with respect to advertising claims that are found to be unsubstantiated.
 
Under current U.S. regulations, our products must comply with certain labeling requirements enforced by the FDA and FTC, but otherwise generally are not required to receive regulatory approval prior to introduction into the U.S. market. We believe we are in compliance with all material government regulations applicable to our products.
 
In addition to the foregoing, our operations and those of our partners are subject to federal, state and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to the practice of medicine, telemedicine and the prescribing of prescription medications. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all material governmental regulations applicable to our operations.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 56 full-time employees. In addition, we use the services of consultants and third-party service providers, where needed. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
COVID-19 Response
 
On March 11, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, states enacted stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, and reduce the burden on the U.S. health care system. In response to COVID-19, our senior leadership assessed the impact across our entire team. Our objective was to ensure the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and the communities we service. Our response to COVID-19 and financial performance in 2020 was a direct result of the dedication and strength of our team members, our strong culture.
Corporate History
 
LifeMD, Inc. was formed in the State of Delaware on May 24, 1994, under our prior name, Immudyne, Inc. We changed our name to Conversion Labs, Inc. on June 22, 2018 and then subsequently, on February 22, 2021, we changed our name to LifeMD, Inc. Further, in connection with changing our name, we changed our trading symbol to LFMD. On April 1, 2016, with respect to a limited liability company operating agreement with joint venture partners for one of our skincare products under the legal name Immudyne PR LLC (“Immudyne PR”), such original operating agreement of Immudyne PR was amended and restated and we increased our ownership and voting interest in Immudyne PR to 78.2%. Concurrent with the name change of the parent company to Conversion Labs, Inc. completed in 2018, Immudyne PR was renamed to Conversion Labs PR LLC (now known as “Conversion Labs PR”). On April 25, 2019, the operating agreement of Conversion Labs PR was amended and restated in its entirety to increase the Company’s ownership and voting interest in Conversion Labs PR to 100%.
 
In June 2018, the Company closed the strategic acquisition of 51% of LegalSimpli Software, LLC (“LegalSimpli”), a software as a service (SaaS) application for converting, editing, signing and sharing PDF documents. In addition to LegalSimpli Software’s growth business model, this acquisition added deep search engine optimization and search engine marketing expertise to the Company. Effective January 22, 2021, we consummated a transaction to restructure the ownership of LegalSimpli (the “LSS Restructuring”). To affect the LSS Restructuring, Conversion Labs PR entered into a series of agreements as further described below.

Effective January 22, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), in furtherance of the LSS Restructuring, CLPR entered into a Membership Interest Exchange Agreement with LegalSimpli, (the “Exchange Agreement”), pursuant to which CLPR exchanged a promissory note dated May 8, 2019 with an outstanding balance of $375,823 (the “CLPR Note”), issued by LegalSimpli in favor of CLPR, for 37,531 newly issued membership interests of LegalSimpli (the “Exchange”). Upon consummation of the Exchange the CLPR Note was extinguished.
Membership Interest Purchase Agreements
 
On the Effective Date, in furtherance of the LSS Restructuring, CLPR entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with LegalSimpli, (the “CLPR MIPA”), pursuant to which CLPR purchased 12,000 membership interests of LegalSimpli for an aggregate purchase price of $300,000. The CLPR MIPA provides that the transaction may be completed in three (3) tranches with a purchase price of $100,000 per tranche to be made at the sole discretion of CLPR. Payment for the first tranche of $100,000 was made upon execution of the CLPR MIPA. Payments for the second and third tranches are due on the 60-day anniversary and the 120-day anniversary of the Effective Date.
 
Concurrently, in furtherance of the LSS Restructuring, CLPR entered into two Membership Interest Purchase Agreements (the “Founding Members MIPAs”) with two founding members of LegalSimpli (the “Founding Members”) whereby CLPR purchased from the Founding Members an aggregate of 2,183 membership interests of LegalSimpli for an aggregate purchase price of $225,000.
 
Following the consummation of the LSS Restructuring, CLPR increased its ownership of LegalSimpli from 51% to approximately 85.58% on a fully-diluted basis. LegalSimpli entered into an amendment to its operating agreement (the “LSS Operating Agreement Amendment”) to reflect the foregoing.
 
LegalSimpli Option Agreements
 
Concurrently, CLPR entered into option agreements with Sean Fitzpatrick (the “Fitzpatrick Option Agreement”) and Varun Pathak (the “Pathak Option Agreement” and, together with Fitzpatrick Option Agreement, the “Option Agreements”), pursuant to which CLPR granted options to purchase membership interest units of LegalSimpli. The Fitzpatrick Option Agreement grants Sean Fitzpatrick the option to purchase 10,300 membership interest units of LegalSimpli for an exercise price of $1.00 per membership interest unit.
 
The Fitzpatrick Options vest in accordance with the following (i) 3,434 membership interests upon LegalSimpli achieving $2,500,000 of gross sales in any fiscal quarter (ii) 3,434 membership interests upon LegalSimpli achieving $4,000,000 of gross sales in any fiscal quarter and (iii) 3,434 membership interests upon LegalSimpli achieving $8,000,000 of gross sales with a ten percent (10%) net profit margin in any fiscal quarter.

Upon vesting, the Fitzpatrick Options and the Pathak Options provide for the potential re-purchase of up to an additional 13.25% of LegalSimpli by Fitzpatrick and Pathak in the aggregate with CLPR ownership ratably reduced to approximately 72.98%.
