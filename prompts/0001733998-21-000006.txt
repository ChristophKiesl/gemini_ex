ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
On October 1, 2018, we completed a reorganization into a holding company structure. In this reorganization, shareholders of NW Natural (the predecessor publicly held parent company) became shareholders of NW Holdings, on a one-for-one basis, with the same number of shares and same ownership percentage as they held in NW Natural immediately prior to the reorganization. NW Natural became a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings. Additionally, certain subsidiaries of NW Natural were transferred to NW Holdings. As required under generally accepted accounting principles, these subsidiaries are presented as discontinued operations in the 2018 consolidated results of NW Natural within this report.
NW Holdings is a holding company headquartered in Portland, Oregon and owns NW Natural, NW Natural Water Company, LLC (NWN Water), and other businesses and activities. NW Natural is NW Holdings’ largest subsidiary. NW Natural owns NW Natural RNG Holding Company, LLC, a holding company established to invest in the development and procurement of renewable natural gas. 
NW Natural distributes natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers in Oregon and southwest Washington. NW Natural and its predecessors have supplied gas service to the public since 1859, was incorporated in Oregon in 1910, and began doing business as NW Natural in 1997. NW Natural's natural gas distribution activities are reported in the natural gas distribution (NGD) segment. All other business activities, including certain gas storage activities, water businesses, and other investments and activities are aggregated and reported as "other" at their respective registrant.
In addition, NW Holdings reported discontinued operations results related to the sale of Gill Ranch Storage, LLC (Gill Ranch). NW Natural Gas Storage, LLC (NWN Gas Storage), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement during the second quarter of 2018 that provides for the sale of all membership interests in Gill Ranch. Gill Ranch owns a 75% interest in the natural gas storage facility located near Fresno, California known as the Gill Ranch Gas Storage Facility. On December 4, 2020, NWN Gas Storage closed the sale of all of the membership interests in Gill Ranch. See Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information.
NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION (NGD) SEGMENT
Both NW Holdings and NW Natural have one reportable segment, the NGD segment, which is operated by NW Natural. NGD provides natural gas service through approximately 770,000 meters in Oregon and southwest Washington. Approximately 88% of customers are located in Oregon and 12% are located in southwest Washington. 
NW Natural has been allocated an exclusive service territory by the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) and Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC), which includes the major population centers in western Oregon, including the Portland metropolitan area, most of the Willamette Valley, the Coastal area from Astoria to Coos Bay, and portions of Washington along the Columbia River. Portland serves as a major West Coast port and is a key distribution center. Major businesses located in NW Natural's service territory include retail, manufacturing, and high-technology industries. 
Customers
The NGD business serves residential, commercial, and industrial customers with no individual customer accounting for more than 10% of NW Natural's or NW Holdings' revenues. On an annual basis, residential and commercial customers typically account for approximately 60% of NGD volumes delivered and approximately 90% of margin. Industrial and other customers largely account for the remaining volumes and margin. 
The following table presents summary meter information for the NGD segment as of December 31, 2020:

 | Number of Meters | % of Volumes | | % of Margin
Residential | 704,675 | | 38 | % | | 64 | %
Commercial | 68,812 | | 21 | % | | 24 | %
Industrial | 989 | | 41 | % | | 7 | %
Other(1) | N/A | N/A | | 5 | %
Total | 774,476 | | 100 | % | | 100 | %

(1) NGD margin is also affected by other items, including miscellaneous revenues, gains or losses from NW Natural's gas cost incentive sharing mechanism, other margin adjustments, and other regulated services. 
Generally, residential and commercial customers purchase both their natural gas commodity (gas sales) and natural gas delivery services (transportation services) from the NGD business. Industrial customers also purchase transportation services, but may buy the gas commodity either from NW Natural or directly from a third-party gas marketer or supplier. Gas commodity cost is primarily a pass-through cost to customers; therefore, profit margins are not materially affected by an industrial customer's decision to purchase gas from NW Natural or from third parties. Industrial and large commercial customers may also select between firm and interruptible service levels, with firm services generally providing higher profit margins compared to interruptible services.
To help manage gas supplies, industrial tariffs are designed to provide some certainty regarding industrial customers' volumes by requiring an annual service election, special charges for changes between elections, and in some cases, a minimum or maximum volume requirement before changing options. 
Customer growth rates for natural gas utilities in the Pacific Northwest historically have been among the highest in the nation due to lower market saturation as natural gas became widely available as a residential heating source after other fuel options. We estimate natural gas was in approximately 63% of single-family residential homes in NW Natural's service territory in 2020. Customer growth in our region comes mainly from the following sources: single-family housing, both new construction and conversions; multifamily housing new construction; and commercial buildings, both new construction and conversions. Single-family new construction has consistently been our largest source of growth. Continued customer growth is closely tied to the comparative price of natural gas to electricity and fuel oil and the economic health of Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington. We believe there is potential for continued growth as natural gas is a preferred direct energy source due to its affordability, reliability, comfort, convenience, and clean qualities. 
Competitive Conditions
In its service areas, the NGD business has no direct competition from other natural gas distributors. However, it competes with other forms of energy in each customer class. This competition among energy suppliers is based on price, efficiency, reliability, performance, preference, market conditions, technology, federal, state, and local energy policy, and environmental impacts. 
For residential and small to mid-size commercial customers, the NGD business competes primarily with providers of electricity, fuel oil, and propane.
In the industrial and large commercial markets, the NGD business competes with all forms of energy, including competition from wholesale natural gas marketers. In addition, large industrial customers could bypass NW Natural's natural gas distribution system by installing their own direct pipeline connection to the interstate pipeline system. NW Natural has designed custom transportation service agreements with several large industrial customers to provide transportation service rates that are competitive with the customer’s costs of installing their own pipeline.
Seasonality of Business
The NGD business is seasonal in nature due to higher gas usage by residential and commercial customers during the cold winter heating months. Other categories of customers experience similar seasonality in their usage but to a lesser extent.
Regulation and Rates
The NGD business is subject to regulation by the OPUC and WUTC. These regulatory agencies authorize rates and allow recovery mechanisms to provide the opportunity to recover prudently incurred capital and operating costs from customers, while also earning a reasonable return on investment for investors. In addition, the OPUC and WUTC also regulate the system of accounts and issuance of securities by NW Natural.
NW Natural files general rate cases and rate tariff requests periodically with the OPUC and WUTC to establish approved rates, an authorized return on equity (ROE), an overall rate of return (ROR) on rate base, an authorized capital structure, and other revenue/cost deferral and recovery mechanisms. 
NW Natural is also regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Under NW Natural's Mist interstate storage certificate with FERC, NW Natural is required to file either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue study every five years to change or justify maintaining the existing rates for the interstate storage service. 
For further discussion on our most recent general rate cases, see Part II, Item 7, "Results of Operations—Regulatory Matters—Regulation and Rates."
Gas Supply
NW Natural strives to secure sufficient, reliable supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost, while maintaining price stability, managing gas purchase costs prudently and supporting our core value of environmental stewardship. This is accomplished through a comprehensive strategy focused on the following items:
•Reliability - ensuring gas resource portfolios are sufficient to satisfy customer requirements under extreme cold weather conditions;
•Diverse Supply - providing diversity of supply sources;
•Diverse Contracts - maintaining a variety of contract durations, types, and counterparties; 
•Cost Management and Recovery - employing prudent gas cost management strategies; and
•Environmental Stewardship - striving to reduce the carbon content and environmental impacts of the energy we deliver.
Reliability
The effectiveness of the natural gas distribution system ultimately rests on whether reliable service is provided to NGD customers. To ensure effectiveness, the NGD business has developed a risk-based methodology in which it uses a planning standard to serve the highest firm sales demand day in any year with 99% certainty. 
The projected maximum design day firm NGD customer sales is approximately 10 million therms. Of this total, the NGD business is currently capable of meeting about 56% of requirements with gas from storage located within or adjacent to its service territory, while the remaining supply requirements would come from gas purchases under firm gas purchase contracts and recall agreements. 
NW Natural segments transportation capacity, which is a natural gas transportation mechanism under which a shipper can leverage its firm pipeline transportation capacity by separating it into multiple segments with alternate delivery routes. The reliability of service on these alternate routes will vary depending on the constraints of the pipeline system. For those segments with acceptable reliability, segmentation provides a shipper with increased flexibility and potential cost savings compared to traditional pipeline service. The NGD business relies on segmentation of firm pipeline transportation capacity that flows from Stanfield, Oregon to various points south of Molalla, Oregon. 
We believe gas supplies would be sufficient to meet existing NGD firm customer demand in the event of maximum design day weather conditions. 
The following table shows the sources of supply projected to be used to satisfy the design day sales for the 2020-21 winter heating season:

Therms in millions | Therms | Percent
Sources of NGD supply: | | 
Firm supply purchases | 3.4 | | 34 | %
Mist underground storage (NGD only) | 3.1 | | 32 | %
Company-owned LNG storage | 1.9 | | 19 | %
Off-system storage contract | 0.5 | | 5 | %
Pipeline segmentation capacity | 0.6 | | 6 | %
Recall agreements | 0.4 | | 4 | %
Total | 9.9 | | 100 | %

The OPUC and WUTC have Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) processes in which utilities define different growth scenarios and corresponding resource acquisition strategies in an effort to evaluate supply and demand resource requirements, consider uncertainties in the planning process and the need for flexibility to respond to changes, and establish a plan for providing reliable service at the least cost.
NW Natural generally files a full IRP biennially for Oregon and Washington with the OPUC and the WUTC, respectively, and files updates between filings. The OPUC acknowledges NW Natural's action plan, whereas the WUTC provides notice that the IRP 
has met the requirements of the Washington Administrative Code. OPUC acknowledgment of the IRP does not constitute ratemaking approval of any specific resource acquisition strategy or expenditure. However, the OPUC Commissioners generally indicate that they would give considerable weight in prudence reviews to actions consistent with acknowledged plans. The WUTC has indicated the IRP process is one factor it will consider in a prudence review. For additional information see Part II, Item 7, "Results of Operations—Regulatory Matters."
Diversity of Supply Sources
NW Natural purchases gas supplies primarily from the Alberta and British Columbia provinces of Canada and multiple receipt points in the U.S. Rocky Mountains to protect against regional supply disruptions and to take advantage of price differentials. For 2020, 62% of gas supply came from Canada, with the balance primarily coming from the U.S. Rocky Mountain region. The extraction of shale gas has increased the availability of gas supplies throughout North America. We believe gas supplies available in the western United States and Canada are adequate to serve NGD customer requirements for the foreseeable future. NW Natural continues to evaluate the long-term supply mix based on projections of gas production and pricing in the U.S. Rocky Mountain region as well as other regions in North America. NW Natural has also announced its intent to incorporate renewable natural gas (RNG) into its supply portfolio. See "Environmental Matters" below.
NW Natural supplements firm gas supply purchases with gas withdrawals from gas storage facilities, including underground reservoirs and LNG storage facilities. Storage facilities are generally injected with natural gas during the off-peak months in the spring and summer, and the gas is withdrawn for use during peak demand months in the winter. 
The following table presents the storage facilities available for NGD business supply: 

 | Maximum Daily Deliverability (therms in millions) | Designed StorageCapacity (Bcf)
Gas Storage Facilities | | 
Owned Facility | | 
Mist, Oregon (Mist Facility)(1) | 3.1 | | 10.6
Mist, Oregon (North Mist Facility)(2) | 1.3 | | 4.1 
Contracted Facility | | 
Jackson Prairie, Washington(3) | 0.5 | | 1.1 
LNG Facilities | | 
Owned Facilities | | 
Newport, Oregon | 0.6 | | 1.0 
Portland, Oregon | 1.3 | | 0.6 
Total | 6.8 | | 17.4

(1) The Mist gas storage facility has a total maximum daily deliverability of 5.4 million therms and a total designed storage capacity of about 16.0 Bcf, of which 3.1 million therms of daily deliverability and 10.6 Bcf of storage capacity are reserved for NGD business customers. 
(2) The North Mist facility is contracted to exclusively serve Portland General Electric, a local electric utility, and may not be used to serve other NGD customers. See "North Mist Gas Storage Facility" below for more information.
(3) The storage facility is located near Chehalis, Washington and is contracted from Northwest Pipeline, a subsidiary of The Williams Companies.
The Mist facility serves NGD segment customers and is also used for non-NGD purposes, primarily for contracts with gas storage customers, including utilities and third-party marketers. Under regulatory agreements with the OPUC and WUTC, gas storage at Mist can be developed in advance of NGD customer needs but is subject to recall when needed to serve such customers as their demand increases. When storage capacity is recalled for NGD purposes it becomes part of the NGD segment. In 2020, the NGD business did not recall additional deliverability or associated storage capacity to serve customer needs. The North Mist facility is contracted for the exclusive use of Portland General Electric, a local electric utility, and may not be used to serve other NGD customers. See "North Mist Gas Storage Facility" below.
Diverse Contract Durations and Types
NW Natural has a diverse portfolio of short-, medium-, and long-term firm gas supply contracts and a variety of contract types including firm and interruptible supplies as well as supplemental supplies from gas storage facilities. 
The portfolio of firm gas supply contracts typically includes the following gas purchase contracts: year-round and winter-only baseload supplies; seasonal supply with an option to call on additional daily supplies during the winter heating season; and daily or monthly spot purchases.
During 2020, a total of 757 million therms were purchased under contracts with durations as follows:

Contract Duration (primary term) | Percent of Purchases
Long-term (one year or longer) | 39 | %
Short-term (more than one month, less than one year) | 23 | 
Spot (one month or less) | 38 | 
Total | 100 | %

Gas supply contracts are renewed or replaced as they expire. During 2020, no individual supplier provided 10% or more of the NGD business gas supply requirements. 
Gas Cost Management
The cost of gas sold to NGD customers primarily consists of the following items, which are included in annual Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) rates: gas purchases from suppliers; charges from pipeline companies to transport gas to our distribution system; gas storage costs; gas reserves contracts; and gas commodity derivative contracts.
The NGD business employs a number of strategies to mitigate the cost of gas sold to customers. The primary strategies for managing gas commodity price risk include:
•negotiating fixed prices directly with gas suppliers;
•negotiating financial derivative contracts that: (1) effectively convert floating index prices in physical gas supply contracts to fixed prices (referred to as commodity price swaps); or (2) effectively set a ceiling or floor price, or both, on floating index priced physical supply contracts (referred to as commodity price options such as calls, puts, and collars);
•buying physical gas supplies at a set price and injecting the gas into storage for price stability and to minimize pipeline capacity demand costs; and
•investing in gas reserves for longer term price stability. See Note 13 for additional information about our gas reserves.
NW Natural also contracts with an independent energy marketing company to capture opportunities regarding storage and pipeline capacity when those assets are not serving the needs of NGD business customers. Asset management activities provide opportunities for cost of gas savings for customers and incremental revenues for NW Natural through regulatory incentive-sharing mechanisms. These activities, net of the amount shared, are included in other for segment reporting purposes.
Gas Cost Recovery
Mechanisms for gas cost recovery are designed to be fair and reasonable, with an appropriate balance between the interests of customers and NW Natural. In general, natural gas distribution rates are designed to recover the costs of, but not to earn a return on, the gas commodity sold. Risks associated with gas cost recovery are minimized by resetting customer rates annually through the PGA and aligning customer and shareholder interests through the use of sharing, weather normalization, and conservation mechanisms in Oregon. See Part II, Item 7, "Results of Operations—Regulatory Matters" and "Results of Operations—Business Segments—Natural Gas Distribution Operations—Cost of Gas".
Environmental Stewardship
Part of our gas supply strategy is working to reduce the carbon content and the environmental impacts of the energy we deliver. To that end, NW Natural developed and implemented an emissions screening tool that uses Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data to calculate the relative emissions intensity of gas producer operations and prioritize purchases from lower emitting producers. Beginning in 2019, we began using this emissions intensity screening tool alongside other purchasing criteria such as price, credit worthiness and geographic diversity. The result has been a cost-neutral way to reduce carbon emissions associated with our natural gas supply.
In addition, NW Natural is actively working to procure RNG contracts under Oregon Senate Bill 98, and is engaging in longer-term efforts to increase the amount of RNG on our system and explore the development of renewable hydrogen through power to gas. See "Environmental Matters" below.
Transportation of Gas Supplies
NW Natural's gas distribution system is reliant on a single, bi-directional interstate transmission pipeline to bring gas supplies into the natural gas distribution system. Although dependent on a single pipeline, the pipeline’s gas flows into the Portland metropolitan market from two directions: (1) the north, which brings supplies from the British Columbia and Alberta supply basins; and (2) the east, which brings supplies from Alberta as well as the U.S. Rocky Mountain supply basins.
NW Natural incurs monthly demand charges related to firm pipeline transportation contracts. These contracts have expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2061. The largest pipeline agreements are with Northwest Pipeline. NW Natural actively works with Northwest Pipeline and others to renew contracts in advance of expiration to ensure gas transportation capacity is sufficient to meet customer needs. 
Rates for interstate pipeline transportation services are established by FERC within the U.S. and by Canadian authorities for services on Canadian pipelines.
Gas Distribution
Safety and the protection of employees, customers, and our communities at large are, and will remain, top priorities. NW Natural constructs, operates, and maintains its pipeline distribution system and storage operations with the goal of ensuring natural gas is delivered and stored safely, reliably, and efficiently. 
NW Natural has one of the most modern distribution systems in the country with no identified cast iron pipe or bare steel main. Since the 1980s, NW Natural has taken a proactive approach to replacement programs and partnered with the OPUC and WUTC on progressive regulation to further safety and reliability efforts for the distribution system. In the past, NW Natural had a cost recovery program in Oregon that encompassed programs for bare steel replacement, transmission pipeline integrity management, and distribution pipeline integrity management as appropriate.
Natural gas distribution businesses are likely to be subject to greater federal and state regulation in the future. Additional operating and safety regulations from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) are currently under development. In 2016, PHMSA issued safety requirements for natural gas transmission pipelines. In 2019, PHMSA issued the first of three portions of these regulations which went into effect on July 1, 2020 and include up to a 15-year timeline for compliance. The remaining portions of the regulations are anticipated to be issued in 2021. NW Natural intends to continue to work diligently with industry associations as well as federal and state regulators to ensure the safety of the system and compliance with new laws and regulations. The costs associated with compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations are expected to be recovered in rates.
North Mist Gas Storage Facility
In May 2019, NW Natural completed an expansion of its existing gas storage facility near Mist, Oregon. The North Mist facility provides long-term, no-notice underground gas storage service and is dedicated solely to Portland General Electric (Portland General) under a 30-year contract with options to extend up to an additional 50 years upon mutual agreement of the parties. Portland General uses the facility to support its gas-fired electric power generation facilities, which incorporate renewable energy into the electric grid. 
North Mist includes a new reservoir providing 4.1 Bcf of available storage, an additional compressor station with a contractual capacity of 120,000 dekatherms of gas per day, no-notice service that can be drawn on rapidly, and a 13-mile pipeline to connect to Portland General's Port Westward gas plants in Clatskanie, Oregon.
Upon placement into service in May 2019, the facility was included in rate base under an established tariff schedule with revenues recognized consistent with the schedule. Billing rates will be updated annually to the current depreciable asset level and forecasted operating expenses.
While there are additional expansion opportunities in the Mist storage field, further development is not contemplated at this time and any expansion would be based on market demand, cost effectiveness, available financing, receipt of future permits, and other rights.
OTHER
Certain businesses and activities of NW Holdings and NW Natural are aggregated and reported as other for segment reporting purposes.
NW Natural
The following businesses and activities are aggregated and reported as other under NW Natural, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings: 
•5.4 Bcf of the Mist gas storage facility contracted to other utilities and third-party marketers;
•natural gas asset management activities; and
•appliance retail center operations.
Mist Gas Storage
The Mist gas storage facility began operations in 1989. It is a 16.0 Bcf facility with 10.6 Bcf used to provide gas storage for the NGD business. The remaining 5.4 Bcf of the facility is contracted with other utilities and third-party marketers with these results reported in other. 
The overall facility consists of seven depleted natural gas reservoirs, 22 injection and withdrawal wells, a compressor station, dehydration and control equipment, gathering lines, and other related facilities. The capacity at Mist serving other utilities and third-party marketers provides multi-cycle gas storage services to customers in the interstate and intrastate markets. The interstate storage services are offered under a limited jurisdiction blanket certificate issued by FERC. Under NW Natural's interstate storage certificate with FERC, NW Natural is required to file either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue 
study every five years to change or justify maintaining the existing rates for the interstate storage service. Intrastate firm storage services in Oregon are offered under an OPUC-approved rate schedule as an optional service to certain eligible customers. Gas storage revenues from the 5.4 Bcf are derived primarily from firm service customers who provide energy-related services, including natural gas distribution, electric generation, and energy marketing. The Mist facility benefits from limited competition as there are few storage facilities in the Pacific Northwest region. Therefore, NW Natural is able to acquire high-value, multi-year contracts.
Asset Management Activities
NW Natural contracts with an independent energy marketing company to provide asset management services, primarily through the use of natural gas commodity exchange agreements and natural gas pipeline capacity release transactions. The results of these activities are included in other, except for the asset management revenues allocated to NGD business customers pursuant to regulatory agreements, which are reported in the NGD segment. 
NW Holdings
These include the following businesses and activities aggregated under NW Holdings:
•NW Natural Water Company, LLC (NWN Water) and its water and wastewater utility operations and acquisition activities;
•an equity method investment in Trail West Holdings, LLC (TWH);
•a minority interest in the Kelso-Beaver Pipeline held by our wholly-owned subsidiary NNG Financial Corporation (NNG Financial); and 
•holding company and corporate activities as well as adjustments made in consolidation. 
On August 6, 2020, NWN Energy completed the sale to an unrelated third party of its interest in TWH. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information.
Water Utilities
After a comprehensive strategic planning process, in December 2017, we entered the water utility sector by announcing several acquisitions, which NWN Water subsequently closed. Through December 31, 2020, NWN Water serves a total of approximately 63,000 people through 26,000 water and wastewater connections in the Pacific Northwest and Texas, with an aggregate investment of nearly $110 million. NW Holdings continues to pursue additional acquisitions in a disciplined manner.
The water and wastewater utilities primarily serve residential and commercial customers. Water distribution operations are seasonal in nature with peak demand during warmer summer months, while wastewater is less seasonally affected. Entities generally operate in exclusive service territories with no direct competitors. Water distribution customer rates are regulated by state utility commissions while the wastewater businesses we own currently are not rate regulated by utility commissions.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Properties and Facilities
NW Natural owns, or previously owned, properties and facilities that are currently being investigated that may require environmental remediation and are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to environmental matters. These laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long time frame to address certain environmental impacts. Estimates of liabilities for environmental costs are difficult to determine with precision because of the various factors that can affect their ultimate disposition. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
•the complexity of the site;
•changes in environmental laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels;
•the number of regulatory agencies or other parties involved;
•new technology that renders previous technology obsolete, or experience with existing technology that proves ineffective;
•the level of remediation required;
•variations between the estimated and actual period of time that must be dedicated to respond to an environmentally-contaminated site; and 
•the application of environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all potentially responsible parties. 

NW Natural has received recovery of a portion of such environmental costs through insurance proceeds, seeks the remainder of such costs through customer rates, and believes recovery of these costs is probable. In both Oregon and Washington, NW Natural has mechanisms to recover expenses. Oregon recoveries are subject to an earnings test. See Part II, Item 7, "Results of Operations—Regulatory Matters—Rate Mechanisms—Environmental Cost Deferral and Recovery", and Note 2 and Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information.
Greenhouse Gas Matters
We recognize certain of our businesses, including our natural gas business, are likely to be affected by requirements to address greenhouse gas emissions. Future federal, state or local legislation or regulation may seek to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, including both carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. These potential laws and regulations may require certain activities to reduce emissions and/or increase the price paid for energy based on its carbon content.
Current federal rules require the reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain industries, specified large GHG emission sources, and facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalents per year. NW Natural began reporting emission information in 2011. Under this reporting rule, local natural gas distribution companies like NW Natural are required to report system throughput to the EPA on an annual basis. The EPA also has required additional GHG reporting regulations to which NW Natural is subject, requiring the annual reporting of fugitive emissions from operations.
The Oregon and Washington state governments have identified emission reduction as a priority and continue to consider various GHG reduction initiatives. On March 10, 2020, the governor of Oregon issued an executive order (EO) establishing GHG emissions reduction goals of at least 45% below 1990 emission levels by 2035 and at least 80% below 1990 emission levels by 2050 and directed state agencies and commissions to facilitate such GHG emission goals targeting a variety of sources and industries. Although the EO does not specifically direct actions of natural gas distribution businesses, the OPUC is directed to prioritize proceedings and activities that advance decarbonization in the utility sector, mitigate energy burden experienced by utility customers and ensure system reliability and resource adequacy. The EO also directs other agencies to cap and reduce GHG emissions from transportation fuels and all other liquid and gaseous fuels, including natural gas, adopt building energy efficiency goals for new building construction, reduce methane emissions from landfills and food waste, and submit a proposal for adoption of state goals for carbon sequestration and storage by Oregon’s forest, wetlands and agricultural lands. These agencies and commissions are currently engaged in various stages of their rulemaking processes and are currently expected to complete those processes in the next 12 to 24 months. NW Natural is actively engaged with Oregon state regulatory entities and holds a seat on the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) rules advisory committee, which is considering the cap and reduce rules.
In Washington, where approximately 10% of NW Natural’s revenues and 22% of new meters are derived, policy focused on the goal of reducing GHGs and enhancing energy efficiency measures for commercial and residential energy customers have been enacted by the Washington State Building Code Council. Effective February 1, 2021, building codes in Washington state require new residential and commercial construction to achieve higher levels of energy efficiency based on specified carbon emissions assumptions, which are expected to calculate on-site electric appliances to have lower GHG emissions than comparable gas appliances, potentially increasing the cost of new building construction incorporating natural gas. Although legislation with similar goals has previously been pursued unsuccessfully in Washington, it is likely that legislatures nationwide and in our service territory will continue to work to combat climate change through legislative action. NW Natural is working with policymakers and a coalition of utilities in Washington to help them understand the role direct use natural gas, and in the coming years renewable natural gas and hydrogen, may play in aggressively pursuing more effective policies to reduce greenhouse gases while preserving reliability, resiliency, energy choice and energy affordability. 
In addition to legislative activities at the state level, ballot measures may be proposed by advocacy groups. Some local and county governments in the United States also have been proposing or passing renewable energy resolutions, restrictions, taxes or fees with advocates seeking to accelerate renewable energy goals. A number of cities across the country, and several in our service territory are currently considering such actions aimed at formalizing climate action goals and driving down GHG emissions, including limitations or bans on the use of natural gas in new construction. NW Natural is actively engaged with such cities and local governments in our service territory and is working to help these communities understand the ways in which the natural gas system, and renewable fuels on the horizon, can help cities meet their decarbonization goals. With the new United States presidential administration, we also expect new federal rules and frameworks related to GHG emissions.
While the outcome of these federal, state or local climate change policy developments cannot be determined at this time, these initiatives could produce a number of results including new regulations, legal actions, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, or other regulatory actions. The adoption and implementation of regulations limiting GHG emissions could require NW Natural to incur compliance costs associated with our customers’ use, which we currently expect to recover through rates and therefore may result in an increase in the prices charged to customers, and a potential decline in the demand for natural gas.
In 2017, NW Natural initiated a multi-pronged, multi-year strategy to accelerate and deliver greater GHG emission reductions in the communities we serve. Key components of this strategy include customer energy efficiency, continued adoption of NW Natural's voluntary Smart Energy carbon offset program, and seeking to incorporate RNG and hydrogen into our gas supply. RNG is produced from organic materials including food, agricultural and forestry waste, wastewater, or landfills. Methane is captured from these organic materials as they decompose and is conditioned to pipeline quality, so it can be added into the existing natural gas system, reducing net GHG emissions. In 2019, Oregon Senate Bill 98 (SB 98) was signed into law enabling NW Natural to procure RNG on behalf of customers and provided voluntary targets that would allow us to make qualified investments and purchase RNG from third parties such that up to 30% of the gas distributed to retail customers is RNG by 2050, and creating a limit of 5% of a utility's revenue requirement that can be used to cover the incremental cost of RNG. The bill was signed into law by the governor in July 2019, and subsequently, the OPUC adopted final rules in July 2020. NW Natural is actively working to procure RNG supply for customers, and is engaging in longer-term efforts to increase the amount of RNG on our system and explore the development of renewable hydrogen through power to gas. In December 2020, NW Natural announced a partnership with BioCarbN, a developer and operator of sustainable infrastructure projects, to convert methane into RNG. Under this partnership, NW Natural has the ability to invest up to an estimated $38 million in four separate RNG development projects that will access biogas derived from water treatment at Tyson Foods' processing plants, subject to approval by all parties. In December 2020, NW Natural exercised its option for the first development project in Nebraska, 
initiating investment in an estimated $8 million project, which we expect will begin producing RNG in late 2021. This is the company’s first investment under Oregon SB 98.
NW Natural continues to take proactive steps in seeking to reduce GHG emissions in our region and is proactively communicating with local, state and federal governments and communities about those steps. We believe that NW Natural has a vital role in providing energy to the communities we serve. Each year, NW Natural delivers more energy in Oregon than any other utility. The sales of natural gas to our residential and commercial customers account for approximately 6% of Oregon’s GHG emissions according to data for recent years from the State of Oregon Department of Environmental Quality In-Boundary GHG Inventory. We intend to continue to provide this necessary energy to our communities and to use our modern pipeline system to help the Pacific Northwest transition to a clean energy future.
HUMAN CAPITAL
Our core values of integrity, safety, caring, service ethic, and environmental stewardship guide how we engage with customers, stakeholders, shareholders, and communities. We actively work to foster these values in our employee culture and to nurture an inclusive and equitable environment that provides opportunities, prioritizes health and safety, and supports growth and learning. We aim to recruit and retain employees who share our core values and reﬂect our communities.

NW Natural's labor agreement with members of OPEIU covers wages, benefits, and working conditions. In November 2019, NW Natural's unionized employees ratified a collective bargaining agreement that took effect on December 1, 2019 and extends to May 31, 2024, and thereafter from year to year unless either party serves notice of its intent to negotiate modifications to the collective bargaining agreement. During calendar year 2020, NW Natural did not incur any work stoppages (strikes or lockouts), and therefore, experienced zero idle days for the year.
Certain subsidiaries may receive services from employees of other subsidiaries. When such services involve regulated entities, those entities receiving services reimburse the entity providing services pursuant to shared services agreements, as applicable.
Safety
Safety is one of our greatest responsibilities to employees. In managing the business, we strive to foster a safety culture focused on prevention, open communication, collaboration, and a strong service and safety ethic. We believe employee safety is critical to our success. A portion of executives’ compensation is tied to achieving our safety metrics, and our Board of Directors regularly reviews company safety metrics. NW Natural’s health and safety policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable regulations, but we also work to go beyond compliance by striving to incorporate industry best practices and benchmarking. 
As part of our commitment to employee health and safety, we maintain regular training programs, emergency preparedness procedures, and speciﬁc training and procedures to identify hazards and handle high-risk emergency situations. Employees complete hands-on, scenario-based training at our training facility in Oregon that allows employees to experience realistic situations in a controlled environment. We also host natural gas safety training events for ﬁrst responders, which prepares our teams to deliver an integrated, seamless response in the event of an emergency that involves or affects the natural gas system.
Our COVID-19 response is just one example of our safety culture in action. As a critical infrastructure energy company that provides an essential service to our customers, NW Natural has well-defined emergency response command structures and protocols. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, NW Natural mobilized its incident command team and business continuity plans in early March 2020, and continues to operate under these structures and protocols, with a focus on the safety of our employees and the people, business partners, and communities we serve. NW Natural has generally suspended business travel 
out of our service territory and implemented work-from-home plans for employees wherever possible. For employees whose role requires them to work in the field, we are following CDC, OSHA, and state specific guidance. Measures include: following social distancing guidelines; use of personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks, face coverings and gloves; enhanced sanitizing protocols; requiring employee health screenings prior to entering a NW Natural facility; and other measures intended to mitigate the spread of this disease and keep our employees and customers safe and informed. Our water companies are following similar protocols. As an essential service provider, our water and natural gas utility businesses continue to serve our customers without interruption. Our experience and continuing focus on workplace safety have enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to the safety of our employees and the people, business partners, and communities served. 
The COVID-19 pandemic also presents challenges for employees’ emotional well-being and ability to balance work and family responsibilities. We are supporting our employees through these unusual times with the following: frequent employee surveys; virtual meetings on wellness topics; resiliency support; additional psychological support services; processes to facilitate flexible and reduced-schedule work where possible; and virtual ergonomic assistance to help remote employees work safely at home.
Employee Benefits
To attract employees and meet the needs of our workforce, NW Natural strives to offer competitive benefits packages to employees. The benefits package options vary depending on type of employee and date of hire. NW Natural continuously looks for ways to support employees’ work-life balance and well-being and this is reflected in physical, mental and financial wellness programs to meet the needs of our employees and help them care for their families. Benefits available to employees during 2020 included, among others: healthcare and other insurance coverages, wellness resources, retirement and savings plans, paid time off programs and flexible work schedules, culture and community-focused resources and opportunities, and employee recognition programs and discounts.
Employee Development
NW Natural seeks to provide its employees with growth and development opportunities through formal and informal programs designed to build skills and relationships. These programs include: (i) a culturally relevant mentoring program that creates opportunities for career growth by building relationships; (ii) a tuition assistance program for qualified educational pursuits; (iii) an internal class that provides participants with a big-picture understanding of the industry and company operations, equipping them to see how they contribute to NW Natural’s success and identify opportunities for career growth; (iv) internal and continuing educational curriculum relevant to areas of expertise; and (v) ongoing management and leadership training programs.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We have a longstanding commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive culture that reflects and supports the communities we serve, and believe a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce contributes to long-term success. This commitment to diversity also extends to leadership positions, including members of the officer team and the Board of Directors. Recruiting, promoting, and retaining diverse talent, building inclusive teams, and creating a culture that embraces differences are at the core of our workforce strategy. To attract diverse candidates, we work with community groups and organizations to help promote awareness of job opportunities within diverse communities. 
In 2020, we launched employee resource groups for Asian-American, African-American, Veteran, Latinx, and LGBT+ employees, which groups are in addition to our existing Women’s Network. We also continue to emphasize employee education, including diversity training for employees at the manager level and above, diversity training as part of new hire onboarding, and other diversity, equity, and inclusion education that occurs throughout the year. An area of focus going forward is to understand, and increase awareness of internal systems and structures that could limit representation and equity for underrepresented employees. To that end, we are working toward revising and refocusing new manager and new hire training to include implicit bias, diversity, equity and inclusion, and anti-racism education.
