Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Since 1967, Dataram Corporation (“Dataram” or the “Company”) has been an independent manufacturer of memory products and provider of performance solutions. The Company provides customized memory solutions for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and compatible memory for leading brands including Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Huawei, IBM, Lenovo and Oracle as well as a line of memory products for Intel and AMD motherboard based servers. Dataram manufactures its memory in-house to meet three key criteria - quality, compatibility, and selection - and tests its memory for performance and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) compatibility as part of the production process. With memory designed for over 50,000 systems and with products that range from energy-efficient DDR4 modules to legacy SDR offerings, Dataram offers one of the most complete portfolios in the industry. The Company is a CMTL Premier Participant and ISO 9001 (2008 Certified). Its products are fully compliant with JEDEC Specifications.
 
Dataram’s customers include an international network of distributors, resellers, retailers, OEM customers and end users.
 
Dataram competes with several other large independent memory manufacturers and the OEMs noted above. The primary raw material used in producing memory boards is dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips. The purchase cost of DRAMs is the largest single component of the total cost of a finished memory board. Consequently, average selling prices for computer memory boards are significantly dependent on the pricing and availability of DRAM chips.
 
In addition to memory products, Dataram offers solutions that provide its customers significant and quantifiable cost savings (reduction in total cost of ownership) while helping them manage end-of-life transitions. These include:
 

● | Design and engineering services 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Contract and flexible manufacturing to accommodate special customer needs 
● | Simulation labs for testing and validation

-


● | Financial programs and trade-in / trade-up programs to allow customers to optimize memory procurements 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Software tools to assess memory needs and optimize memory deployment and application performance 

 
Dataram operates through two business lines which provide complementary solutions to the market. Each has a different customer focus and “go to market” approach. They are:
 

● | Enterprise Memory Solutions (formerly Princeton Memory) 
--+------------------------------------------------------------
● | Web Solutions (formerly Micro Memory Bank (MMB)) 

 
The Enterprise Memory Solutions business provides innovative new memory products that support enterprise / mission critical needs; custom and high-end memory solutions for the most demanding customers ranging from enterprise and data center segments to power users; provides solutions to extend the density memory options available to customers. The business also provides:
 

● | Memory Solutions Services: 
--+-------------------------------


o | Performance optimization, total cost of computing reduction consulting 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | Engineering and design services for embedded applications 
o | Customized consignment programs 
o | Product on-demand offerings 
o | Installation services 


● | Software: products that improve application and computing performance 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Trade-in / Buy-back Program: provides customers with opportunity to “trade-in” existing memory as part of a sale with trade-in credited towards purchase of new memory. Memory traded-in is inspected, tested, certified, refurbished as needed, and then sold. 
● | Legacy Memory Solutions: provides new and refurbished memory products which are not commonly available. These solutions extend the life of the system where memory is no longer available by the OEM, helping companies avoid the cost of additional hardware expenditures. 
● | Storage Solutions: the storage product line provides primarily SSDs (solid state drives) for enterprise and data center environments. 
● | ITAD (IT Asset Disposition) / Technology Recycling: ITAD services provide end of life recycling services to customers across all IT hardware categories including laptops, desktops, workstations, servers, main frames, hubs and switches. 

 
The Web Solutions business (formerly Micro Memory Bank (MMB)) business procures and sells new and refurbished memory for laptops, desktops and servers through its online / e-commerce / web operations. It includes the 18004Memory.com and Memorystore.com businesses. The Web Solutions business maintains a particular niche in legacy memory products where memory is no longer available by the OEM. It is one of the few businesses in the industry that can source and supply most memory upgrades ever manufactured to include technologies such as FPM, EDO, SDRAM, DDR, DDR2, DDR3 and DDR4 products for Notebooks, PCs and Servers. The business also sells memory products for a wide range of consumer oriented devices including significant business in Apple-Mac memory. The business also, on a limited basis, provides brokerage services whereby it makes opportunistic purchases of excess surplus inventories for less than market price and upon acquisition, tests, certifies and sometimes refurbishes the product, prior to sale.

Dataram History
 
The Company is incorporated in the State of Nevada and was originally incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1967. The Company’s common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol "USAU"
 
On June 13, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended and restated on July 29, 2016, and further amended and restated on September 14, 2016 and November 28, 2016 (as so amended, the “Merger Agreement”), with Dataram Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary (“DAS”), U.S. Gold Corp., a Nevada corporation (“USG”) and Copper King LLC, the principal shareholder of USG (“Copper King”).
 
On July 6, 2016, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to effectuate a reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock on a 1 for 3 basis. The reverse stock split was effective on July 11, 2016. All share and per share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to the reverse stock-split.
 
On May 3, 2017, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to effectuate a reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock on a 1 for 4 basis. The reverse stock split was effective on May 5, 2017. All share and per share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to the reverse stock-split.
 
On May 23, 2017 (the “Closing Date”), the Company closed the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”) and filed Articles of Merger with the State of Nevada, pursuant to which USG was merged with and into DAS, with USG surviving the merger as the surviving corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company .
 
The Company's principal executive office is located at 777 Alexander Road, Suite 100, Princeton, New Jersey, 08540, its telephone number is (609) 799-0071, its fax is (609) 799-6734, and its website is located at http://www.dataram.com.
 
Available Information
 
The Company files annual, quarterly, and current reports, as well as proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission, available to the public free of charge over the Internet at our website at http://www.dataram.com where our corporate governance materials, committee charters and code of conduct are also available. In addition, materials we file with the SEC are available on the SEC’s website as www.SEC.GOV free of charge.
Industry Background
 
The market for the Company’s memory products is principally the buyers and owners of workstations, servers and the OEMs that manufacture workstations, servers and other products that use embedded computers. These systems have been important to the growth of the Internet.
 
The OEM market is also an important part of the Company’s business. We believe that increasingly cost conscious OEMs are looking to independent memory suppliers such as the Company for the low-cost supply of memory modules.

A workstation, like a PC, is designed to provide computer resources to individual users. A workstation differs from a PC by providing substantially greater computational performance, input/output capability and graphic display. Workstations are nearly always networked. As a result of this networking capability of both workstations and PCs, we believe the value of the network server has increased.
 
Network servers are computer systems on a network which provide dedicated functions accessible by all workstations and other systems on the same network. Examples of different types of servers in use today include file servers, communication servers, computation servers, database servers, print servers and storage servers.
 
The Company provides customized memory solutions for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and compatible memory for leading brands including Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Huawei, IBM, Lenovo and Oracle as well as a line of memory products for Intel and AMD motherboard based servers.
 
The “open system” philosophy espoused by most of the general computer industry has played a part in enlarging the market for third party vendors. Under the “open system” philosophy, manufacturers adhere to industry design standards, enabling users to “mix and match” hardware and software products from a variety of vendors so that a system can be configured for the user’s application in the most economical manner with reduced concern for compatibility and support. Memory products for workstations and servers have become commodities with substantial competition from OEMs and a number of independent memory manufacturer suppliers.
 
Products
 
The Company’s principal business is the development, manufacture and marketing of memory modules which can be installed initially or, added to various enterprise servers and workstations to upgrade or expand the capabilities of such systems. When vendors produce computer systems adhering to open system industry standards, the development effort for the Company and other independent memory manufacturers is straightforward and allows for the use of many standard components.
 
Our RAMDisk software product creates a virtual RAM drive, or block of memory, which a computer treats as if it were a disk drive. By storing files and programs into memory, a user can speed up internet load times, disk-to-disk activities, accelerate databases and reduce compile times. The product features a save and load option that allows RAMDisk to appear as persistent storage, even through reboots. RAMDisk has developed a strong presence in both the consumer and commercial marketplace. RAMDisk software has also been licensed and integrated into specialized commercial products. RAMDisk is also capable of extending the longevity of expensive solid state storage devices by housing writes which tend to wear out these devices.
 
DRAM Prices
 
The memory product business is heavily dependent upon the price of DRAMs. Producers of DRAM are required to invest substantial capital resources to produce their end product. Their marginal cost is low as a percentage of the total cost of the product. As a result, the world-wide market for DRAMs has swung in the past from period to period from oversupply to shortage. During periods of substantial oversupply, the Company has seen falling prices for DRAMs and wide availability of DRAMs allowing the Company to maintain minimum inventories to meet the needs of customers. During periods of shortages, DRAMs are allocated to customers and the Company must invest heavily in inventory in order to continue to be assured of the supply of DRAMs from vendors. At the present time, the market for DRAMs is soft, but with spot shortages of certain DRAM configurations.

Distribution
 
The Company sells its memory products to OEMs, distributors, value-added resellers and larger end-users. The Company also sells its memory products through various internet channels. The Company has sales and/or marketing support offices in the USA and Europe.
Product Warranty and Service
 
Management believes that Dataram’s reputation for providing reliable memory products and confidence of prospective purchasers in Dataram’s ability to provide service over the life of the product, are important factors in making sales. The Company offers a Limited Lifetime Warranty program for its memory products. The economic useful life of the computer systems to which the Company's memory modules are attached is almost always substantially less than the physical useful life of the Company's memory products; therefore, Dataram’s memory products are unlikely to "wear out." The Company's experience is that less than 0.5% of all the products it sells are returned under the Lifetime Warranty.
Memory Product Complexity
 
DRAM memory products for workstations and enterprise servers have, for many years, been undergoing a process of simplification with a corresponding decline in profit margins for current generation memory products as competitors’ entry into the market becomes easier. Memory products for prior generations of workstations and servers are sold with higher margins as few competitors continue to supply memory for those computers.
Engineering
 
The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends upon its ability to identify new memory needs of its customers. To achieve this goal, the Company’s engineering group continually monitors computer system new product developments, and the Company evaluates and tests major components as they become available. The Company designs prototype memory modules and subjects them to reliability testing procedures. The Company incurred engineering costs of $185,000 in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017 and $191,000 in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016.
Raw Materials
 
The Company purchases industry standard DRAMs. The Company also purchases finished modules from DRAM manufacturers. In either case, the cost of DRAM chips is the largest single component of the total cost of our memory products. Fluctuations in the availability or prices of DRAMs can have a significant impact on the Company’s profit.
 
The Company has created close relationships with a number of primary suppliers while qualifying and developing alternate sources as backups. The qualification program consists of extensive evaluation of process capabilities, on-time delivery performance and the financial stability of each supplier. Alternative sources are used to assure supply in the event of a problem with the primary source or to handle surges in demand.

Manufacturing
 
The Company assembles its memory boards at its manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania.
 
Backlog
 
The Company expects that all of the backlog on hand will be in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending April 30, 2018. The Company's backlog at April 30, 2017 was $399,000 and at April 30, 2016 was $274,000. Product backlog at any point in time may not translate into net revenue in any subsequent period, as unfilled orders can generally be canceled at any time by the customer.
Competition
 
The intensely competitive computer industry is characterized by rapid technological change and constant pricing pressures. These characteristics are equally applicable to the third party memory market, where pricing is a major consideration in the buying decision. The Company competes with HP, Sun Microsystems, IBM, and Dell, as well as with a number of third party memory suppliers, including Kingston Technology.
 
Although many of the Company’s competitors possess significantly greater financial, marketing and technological resources, the Company competes favorably based on the buying criteria of price/performance, time-to-market, product quality, reliability, service/support, breadth of product line and compatibility with computer system vendors’ technology. The Company’s objective is to continue to remain strong in all of these areas with particular focus on price/performance and time-to-market, which management believes are two of the more important criteria in the selection of third party memory product suppliers. Market research and analysis capability by the Company is necessary to ensure timely information on new products and technologies coming from the computer system vendors and from the overall memory market. The Company must continue low cost, high volume production while remaining flexible to satisfy the time-to-market requirement.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
The Company believes that its success depends primarily upon the price and performance of its products rather than on ownership of copyrights or patents.
 
Sale of memory products for systems that use proprietary memory design may from time to time give rise to claims of copyright or patent infringement. In most such instances the Company has products that either do not violate such patents or copyrights or obtained a license.
 
Because of rapid technological development in the computer industry with concurrent extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, questions of infringement may continue to arise in the future. If such patents or copyrights are issued in the future, the Company believes, based upon industry practice, that any necessary licenses would be obtainable upon the payment of reasonable royalties.
 
Employees
 
As of April 30, 2017, the Company had 15 full-time salaried employees and 10 hourly employees. The Company believes it has satisfactory relationships with its employees. None of the Company’s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

Environmental
 
Compliance with federal, state and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted to regulate the protection of the environment does not have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company. The Company did not make any material expenditures for environmental control facilities in the current fiscal year, nor does the Company expect to make material expenditure in the fiscal year ending April 30, 2018.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 
Reverse Stock Split
 
On May 3, 2017, Dataram Corporation filed a certificate of amendment to its Articles of Incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to effectuate a reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Stock on a one for four basis. The reverse stock split became effective with NASDAQ at the open of business on May 8, 2017. The par value and other terms of the Company’s common stock were not affected by the reverse stock split. As a result of the reverse stock split, every four shares of the Company’s pre-reverse stock split common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of the Company’s common stock. No fractional shares of common stock were issued as a result of the reverse stock split. All common stock and per share amounts have been retroactively restated herein to give effect to the reverse stock split.
Completion of Merger Agreement
 
On June 13, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended and restated on July 29, 2016, and further amended and restated on September 14, 2016 and November 28, 2016 (as so amended, the “Merger Agreement”), with Dataram Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary (“DAS”), U.S. Gold Corp., a Nevada corporation (“USG”) and Copper King LLC, the principal shareholder of USG (“Copper King”).
 
On May 23, 2017 (the “Closing Date”), the Company closed the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”) and filed Articles of Merger with the State of Nevada, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1, pursuant to which USG was merged with and into DAS, with USG surviving the merger as the surviving corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”).

Changes to Business
 
Following the Closing of the Merger, the Company operates as a single entity with two reporting businesses – a junior mining business and a memory business.
 
USG
 
Through the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, USG, the Company owns certain mining leases and other mineral rights and will engage in gold exploration.
 
On June 9, 2017, U.S. Gold Corp. filed a certificate of amendment to its articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada in order to change its name to “Gold King Corp”.
Dataram Memory
 
Through the Company’s new, wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary, Dataram Memory, the Company will continue its legacy business, consisting of, among other things, manufacture, distribution, design, development and sale of memory modules, software products, and technical services (the “Legacy Business”).
 
While each of these businesses will be operated and managed independent of one another, they will share common resources and functions to include, but not limited to, human resources, legal, facilities, back office operations and administrative support. The sharing of common functions and resources will be of mutual operational and financial benefit.
 
Distribution of Net Proceeds of Legacy Business
 
While the Company has no current plans to divest assets of the Legacy Business, if such assets are divested within 18 months of the Closing Date, shareholders of record as of the close on business on May 8, 2017 may be entitled to a distribution, if any, of an interest in the Company’s assets related to its Legacy Business. The Company’s Board of Directors intends to create an irrevocable liquidating trust pursuant to which Dataram Memory will, immediately prior to the divestiture of the assets related to the Legacy Business, place such assets or proceeds there from into such trust to be held for the benefit of the shareholders of record as of May 8, 2017. Shareholders as of the record date will receive a non-transferable beneficial interest in proportion to such shareholder’s pro rata ownership interest in the Company’s Common Stock as of the close of business on the record date, after giving effect to the authorized 1-for-4 reverse split of the Company’s Common Stock which became effective at the market open on May 8, 2017; provided, however, there can be no assurance that the Company will enter into any transaction, that any net proceeds will become available, or that the trust will be created. 
Accounting Treatment
 
The Merger is being accounted for as a “reverse merger,” and USG is deemed to be the acquirer in the reverse merger. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that will be reflected in the financial statements prior to the Merger will be those of USG, and the consolidated financial statements after completion of the Merger will include the assets and liabilities of USG, historical operations of USG and operations of the Company from the Closing Date of the Merger.
