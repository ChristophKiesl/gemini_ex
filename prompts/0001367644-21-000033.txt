ITEM 1. BUSINESS


OVERVIEW
We are a global life sciences company focused on providing innovative preparedness and response solutions addressing accidental, deliberate and naturally occurring public health threats (PHTs). Our solutions include a product portfolio, a product development pipeline portfolio, and a portfolio of CDMO services. The types of PHTs we are currently addressing are focused on the following five categories:
•chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosives (CBRNE); 
•emerging infectious diseases (EID); 
•travel health; 
•emerging health crises; and 
•acute/emergency care. 
Our product portfolio comprises ten marketed products (vaccines, therapeutics, and drug-device combination products) that are sold to government and commercial customers. Our product portfolio also includes two product candidates, designated AV7909 (vaccine) and Trobigard Auto-Injector (drug-device combination), that are not approved by the FDA or any other regulatory health authority, but which are procured under special circumstances by certain government agencies. 
Our product development pipeline portfolio consists of a diversified mix of both pre-clinical and clinical-stage product candidates, encompassing a mix of vaccines, therapeutics and drug-device combination products. In some cases, certain candidates are supported by external, non-dilutive funding sources (government agencies, non-governmental organizations, pharma/biotech innovators). Certain other candidates are supported solely by internal funding sources.
Our portfolio of CDMO services consists of three distinct but interrelated service pillars: development services (process and analytical development); drug substance manufacturing; and drug product manufacturing (fill/finish) and packaging. These services, which we refer to as "molecule-to-market" offerings, employ five technology platforms (mammalian, microbial, viral, plasma and gene therapy) across a network of nine geographically distinct development and manufacturing sites operated by us for our internal products and pipeline and CDMO services, for both clinical-stage projects and commercial-stage projects. We direct these CDMO services for a variety of third-party customers, including innovative pharmaceutical companies, government agencies and non-government organizations. 
Our revenues are derived from a combination of the sale and procurement of our product portfolio and the provision of our CDMO services to external customers.
STRATEGY
Our current five-year strategic plan, 2020-2024, is focused on leveraging core competencies, relationships and operating systems we have developed over the last 22 years and driving growth across various segments of the PHT market. The strategic plan includes achievement of the following financial goals by the end of 2024:
•Total revenue of at least $2 billion; and
•Adjusted EBITDA margin of 27%-30%. 
In pursuit of these goals, the strategic plan specifies employing five core strategies. They are: 
Execute Core Business — We are focused on continuing to build our leadership positions across several markets in the PHT space. These include, but are not limited to, medical countermeasures (MCMs), opioid rescue and travel health. Additionally, our Core Business includes our growing CDMO services. We believe our diversified portfolio of products and services, combined with our quality development and manufacturing services across a spectrum of differentiated and complex manufacturing processes position us for continued growth across the PHT landscape. Additionally, we will continue to leverage our specialized government relations and contracting operations to negotiate long-term, profitable procurement and development agreements that enable us to protect and enhance lives around the world and that help ensure sustainability of our business. 
Grow Through Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) — We have successfully executed and integrated several product and facility acquisitions that have increased our diversification, allowed expansion into new markets, and provided a differentiated research and development (R&D) pipeline. We plan to continue to leverage our M&A and partnering strengths not only to solidify our leadership positions in the MCM market, but also to expand our businesses in PHT markets where the government is not the primary customer. We aim to accomplish this goal through a disciplined approach to acquiring accretive or clinical-stage assets and to forming partnerships that help us to achieve our strategic objectives. 
Strengthen R&D Portfolio — We continue to focus on expanding and advancing our pipeline of drug and device product candidates across several categories, with the aim to launch and/or sell differentiated products that address unmet needs in the PHT space. We fund our pipeline by investing our own funds and through securing government contracts, grants, or other non-dilutive funding. We plan to grow our R&D pipeline to expand our portfolio of marketed and procured PHT products.
Build Scalable Capabilities — Achieving our 2024 strategic objectives requires an investment in infrastructure, internal governance and capabilities that help us realize the benefits of scale. This includes investing new capital into our development and manufacturing facilities, strengthening our global sales and procurement models, upgrading our technology and growing our commercial infrastructure. These, and other capabilities, are intended to help us operate in a more efficient, customer-focused manner, while better serving both government and non-government customers. 
Evolve the Culture --- We are proud of our heritage and organization we have built, and further believe that the growth we are striving for requires continued improvement and refinement of the culture of the organization. We anticipate continuing to invest in development of our people and our culture consistent with our values. We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent reflecting a diversity of ideas, backgrounds, and perspectives and seek to demonstrate that commitment through our talent development strategy, processes and company-wide programs.
OUR BUSINESS UNITS
We are organized into four business units: 
•Three product business units: Vaccines, Devices, Therapeutics, and
•One services business unit: CDMO. 
Vaccines
Vaccine Products
Our Vaccines business unit contains a portfolio of specialty vaccines that address existing and emerging PHTs consisting of the following products:

APPROVED VACCINES BUSINESS UNIT PRODUCTS 
Product | Indication(s) | Primary Regulatory Approvals 
ACAM2000®(Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine, Live) | Vaccine for active immunization against smallpox disease for persons determined to be at high risk for smallpox infection. | United States, Australia, Singapore 
BioThrax®(Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed) | Vaccine for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by Bacillus anthracis in persons 18 through 65 years of age. | United States, Canada, France (where it is known as BaciThrax®), Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore and UK 
Vaxchora®(Cholera Vaccine Live Oral) | Vaccine indicated for active immunization against disease caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroup 01 in persons 2 through 64 years of age traveling to cholera-affected areas. | United States, EU 
Vivotif®(Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral Ty21a) | For immunization of adults and children greater than 6 years of age against disease caused by Salmonella typhi. | United States Argentina, Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and UK

ACAM2000® (Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine, Live). ACAM2000 is a smallpox vaccine licensed by the FDA and is the primary smallpox vaccine designated for use in a bioterrorism emergency. ACAM2000 is also licensed in Australia and Singapore and is currently stockpiled both in the United States and internationally. Smallpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the variola virus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it is one of the most devastating diseases with a mortality rate as high as 30%. The vaccine stimulates a person's immune system to develop antibodies and cells in the blood and elsewhere that can then help the body fight off a smallpox infection if exposure to smallpox occurs.
On September 3, 2019, we announced the award by the USG of a contract valued at up to approximately $2 billion over 10 years for the continued supply of ACAM2000 into the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), assuming all contract options are exercised. This multiple-year contract is intended to support the replacement of the smallpox 

vaccine stockpile and included a one-year base period of performance in 2019 valued at approximately $170 million, and nine option years. The number of doses under the base period were delivered by year end 2019. On May 28, 2020, we announced the exercise by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) of the first contract option, valued at $176 million, to procure doses of ACAM2000. The number of doses under the first contract option were delivered by year end 2020. The actual number of ACAM2000 doses to be procured in the future is dependent on certain timing and tiered-pricing terms that are subject to the discretion of HHS. 
BioThrax®(Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed). BioThrax is the only vaccine licensed by the FDA for pre-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease in persons at high risk of exposure. BioThrax was granted orphan drug designation (market exclusivity) through 2022 (see "Regulation - Marketing Approval - Biologics, Drugs and Vaccines - Orphan Drugs"). BioThrax is also 


approved by the FDA for post-exposure prophylaxis indication for BioThrax administered in combination with antimicrobial therapy. Anthrax is a potentially fatal disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus anthracis. Inhalational anthrax is the most lethal form of anthrax. In the United States, BioThrax is administered in a pre-exposure prophylaxis setting by intramuscular injection as a three-dose primary series over a six-month period. Per the U.S. label, booster doses are administered 6 and 12 months after completion of the primary series and at 12 month intervals thereafter. BioThrax is administered in a post-exposure prophylaxis setting in conjunction with recommended antibacterial drugs following suspected or confirmed Bacillus anthracis exposure. When we report the revenue associated with “anthrax vaccines”, it reflects the combined revenue from the procurement and sale of BioThrax as well as the product candidate AV7909 (described below).
In December 2016, we signed a follow-on contract with the CDC for the supply of up to approximately 29.4 million doses of BioThrax for delivery into the SNS, over a five-year period ending in September 2021.
Vaxchora® (Cholera Vaccine Live Oral). Vaxchora is a live attenuated cholera vaccine for oral administration and the first vaccine approved by the FDA for the prevention of cholera infection. Cholera is a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and dehydration. It has a low incidence in the United States and Europe, but a high incidence in Africa, 

Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas have historically drawn travelers from the United States and Europe, so cholera can occur in patients who return to the United States or Europe from visits to these regions. Vaxchora is indicated for active immunization against cholera caused by the bacterium V. cholerae serogroup 01. 
We have generally marketed Vaxchora to a subset of travelers primarily from the United States. Our sales of Vaxchora were disrupted in 2020 due to the broader disruption to travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect limited sales in 2021 due to that continuing disruption.
Vivotif® (Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral Ty21a). Vivotif is a live attenuated vaccine for oral administration to prevent typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is a potentially severe and occasionally life-threatening febrile illness caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, a bacterium that only lives in humans. It is usually acquired by consumption of water or food that has been contaminated by feces of an infected person. Travelers from North America and Europe going to Asia, Africa, and Latin America have historically been particularly at risk. 
We have generally marketed Vivotif to a subset of travelers primarily from the United States and the European Union. Our sales of Vivotif were disrupted in 2020 due to the broader disruption to travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect limited sales in 2021 due to that continuing disruption.


Vaccine Product Candidates
The chart below highlights two of our leading vaccine pipeline product candidates:

Product Candidate | Target Indication 
AV7909*(anthrax vaccine adsorbed with adjuvant) | Procured vaccine candidate for post-exposure prophylaxis of disease resulting from suspected or confirmed Bacillus anthracis exposure.
CHIKV VLP Chikungunya virus VLP vaccine | Vaccine candidate being developed for active immunization to prevent disease caused by Chikungunya virus. 
*AV7909 is not approved by the FDA or any other health regulatory agency, but it is being procured by BARDA under special circumstances under government authorization.

Description of Procured Vaccine Product Candidate
AV7909 (anthrax vaccine adsorbed with adjuvant). We are developing AV7909, an anthrax vaccine product candidate based on anthrax vaccine adsorbed combined with an adjuvant. Studies have shown that AV7909 elicits a more rapid onset of immune response using fewer doses than BioThrax while still providing protective immunity in patients. AV7909 is expected to provide protection with a two-dose regimen (versus the BioThrax three-dose regimen) for 

post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease. In September 2016, we signed a combination development and procurement contract with BARDA, which included a five-year base period of performance to develop AV7909 for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease and to deliver to the SNS an initial two million doses, subsequently modified to three million doses in March 2017. The contract also includes procurement options for the delivery of an additional 7.5 million to 50 million doses of AV7909 into the SNS and options for an additional clinical 


study and post marketing commitments. In 2019, we initiated and completed enrollment of a Phase 3 study; the 3,850 subject trial evaluating safety, immunogenicity and lot consistency was completed in 2020. In collaboration with us, the CDC filed with the FDA a pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) submission package related to AV7909, which triggered BARDA to begin procurement of AV7909 in 2019. On May 15, 2019, we announced that BARDA had informed us that it would begin procuring AV7909 for delivery into the SNS and on July 30, 2019, BARDA exercised its first contract option valued at approximately $261 million to procure doses to be delivered to the SNS through June of 2020. On July 14, 2020, we announced the exercise by BARDA of 

another contract option, valued at $258 million, to procure additional doses of AV7909 for delivery into the SNS over 12 months. We currently anticipate the submission of a biologics license application (BLA) for AV7909 to the FDA in 2021, although there can be no assurance it will be approved by the FDA.
When we report the revenue associated with "anthrax vaccines," it reflects the combined revenue from the procurement and sale of AV7909 as well as BioThrax (described above).


Devices
Device Products
Our Devices business unit contains a portfolio of device and drug-device combination products that address PHTs. The current portfolio consists of the following products:

APPROVED DEVICES BUSINESS UNIT PRODUCTS 
Product | Indication(s) | Primary Regulatory Approvals 
NARCAN® (naloxone HCl) Nasal Spray | Emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose as demonstrated by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. | United States, Canada 
RSDL®(Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion Kit) | Removal or neutralization of chemical warfare agents from the skin: tabun, sarin, soman, cyclohexyl sarin, VR, VX, mustard gas and T-2 toxin. | United States (510k), Australia, Canada, European Union, Israel

NARCAN® (naloxone HCl) Nasal Spray. NARCAN® (naloxone HCl) Nasal Spray, a product we obtained in connection with our acquisition of Adapt Pharma Inc. in 2018, is an intranasal formulation of naloxone approved by the FDA and Health Canada for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose as demonstrated by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. The primary customers for NARCAN Nasal Spray are state health departments, local law enforcement agencies, community-based organizations, substance abuse centers, federal agencies and consumers through pharmacies fulfilling physician-directed or standing order prescriptions. Recently, we completed two important product life cycle improvements that we expect will provide meaningful value for our customers. First, we launched the Generation II NARCAN Nasal Spray device, which has a claim for enhanced temperature excursions and storage below 25° C. Second, we gained FDA approval for an extension of the shelf life of NARCAN from 24 months to 36 months.
RSDL® (Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion Kit). RSDL is the only medical device cleared by the FDA that is intended to remove or neutralize chemical warfare agents from the skin, including tabun, sarin, soman, cyclohexyl sarin, VR, VX, mustard gas and T-2 toxin. RSDL has also been cleared as a medical device by Health Canada, has a current European 

Conformity (CE) mark under European Directives, and is licensed by the Israel Ministry of Health and by Australia's Therapeutics Goods Administration. To date, the principal customers for RSDL have been agencies of the USG, including the Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Guard. Our current contract with the DoD, awarded in September 2017, is a five-year contract valued at up to approximately $171 million to supply RSDL for use by all branches of the U.S. military. In addition to the DoD and other USG agencies, beginning in 2017, we made RSDL available for the first time for purchase by civilians in the United States. We have also sold RSDL to 35 foreign countries outside the United States since the device was cleared in 2003.


Device Product Candidates


The chart below highlights several of our pipeline product candidates in our Devices business unit.

Product Candidate | Target Indication 
AP003 (Naloxone multidose nasal spray) | A nasal delivery device candidate designed to deliver multiple 4mg doses to treat acute opioid overdose. 
AP007 (Sustained release nalmefene injectable) | A slow release injectable candidate designed to release an effective dose of nalmefene over an extended time period that is intended to treat addiction and reduce the potential for relapse in patients undergoing treatment for opioid use disorder.
SIAN (stabilized isoamyl nitrite) | A single-use intranasal spray device candidate being developed to deliver a stabilized form of isoamyl nitrite (SIAN) that is intended to be developed for use by first responders and medical personnel following a cyanide incident. 
Trobigard Auto-Injector®* (atropine sulfate, obidoxime chloride) | Combination drug-device auto-injector procured product candidate for potential use as a nerve agent countermeasure. 
*Trobigard has not been approved by the FDA or any other health regulatory authority but has been procured by various government buyers under special circumstances.

We have also been developing a suite of drug-device combination product candidates in an auto-injector platform based on our proprietary technology; primarily for military and other government use.
Therapeutics
Therapeutics Products
Our Therapeutics business unit contains a portfolio of specialty antibody-based therapeutics that address various existing and emerging PHTs. The current portfolio consists of the following products:

APPROVED THERAPEUTICS BUSINESS UNIT PRODUCTS

Anthrasil® [Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)]. Anthrasil is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA for the treatment of inhalational anthrax. Anthrasil is licensed by the FDA for the treatment of inhalational anthrax in adult and pediatric patients in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs. Anthrasil also received orphan drug designation for that indication, resulting in market exclusivity in the United States until March 2022. We currently have two contracts with HHS: a development and procurement contract that expires in April 2021, and a multiple award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for the collection of anti-anthrax plasma, as well as the manufacture of such plasma into bulk drug substance and finished drug product and delivery of finished product into the SNS. This contract covers extended plasma storage, and the options for manufacturing and product delivery, which are available to be exercised by HHS through September 2023. In addition to domestic government sales, Anthrasil has been sold to several foreign governments, including the Canadian government. 
BAT® [Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A,B,C,D,E,F,G)(Equine)]. BAT is the only heptavalent antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of botulism. BAT is licensed by the FDA for the treatment of symptomatic botulism following suspected or documented exposure to 

botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A, B, C, D, E, F or G in adults and pediatric patients. It is also licensed in Canada pursuant to Health Canada’s EUND regulations. BAT is also approved in Singapore and Ukraine. BAT is the only heptavalent botulism antitoxin available in the United States and Canada for treating naturally occurring botulism in adults or pediatric patients. Botulinum toxin is a nerve toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum that causes botulism, a serious paralytic illness. On May 8, 2020, we announced the finalization of a previously announced contract with HHS, valued at up to $550 million, if all options under the contract are exercised. The contract has two deliverables. The first deliverable, negotiated in September 2019 and valued at up to approximately $90 million, is to supply annual doses of BAT into the SNS for 10 years by converting existing bulk drug substance into final drug product. This deliverable also includes options for additional doses valued at up to approximately $94 million over 10 years. The second deliverable, valued at up to approximately $366 million, is for the production of additional doses of bulk drug substance over 10 years to maintain the plasma collection and production capability for botulism response planning. In addition to domestic government sales, BAT continues to be sold internationally, with deliveries to over 10 foreign governments in 2020.


Raxibacumab. Our raxibacumab product is the first fully human monoclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA for the treatment and prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis. Our raxibacumab product is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with inhalational anthrax in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs and for prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or appropriate. We assumed responsibility for a multi-year contract with BARDA from Human Genome Sciences, Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline LLC (collectively referred to as GSK) to supply the product to the SNS through November 2019. All deliveries under this contract are complete. We intend to submit a proposal for a follow-on contract with the USG to continue the supply of this medical countermeasure (MCM) to the SNS. In addition, we have initiated the process of transferring raxibacumab manufacturing from GSK to our facilities.
VIGIV [Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)]. VIGIV is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA to address certain complications from replicating virus smallpox 

vaccination. VIGIV is being procured by the USG and delivered into the SNS. VIGIV is prepared using plasma collected from healthy, screened donors who have been immunized with our ACAM2000 vaccine or previously immunized with the DryVax vaccine. Vaccinia is not the virus that causes smallpox, but it is similar enough to elicit a protective immune response when used as a smallpox vaccine. Individuals who are susceptible to vaccinia may develop a specific type of reaction or infection from ACAM2000 or other similar replicating virus vaccines, and these patients may benefit from treatment with VIGIV. VIGIV is licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for counteracting complications that can be associated with replicating virus smallpox vaccination. Although VIGIV has been sold to foreign governments, to date, the principal customer for VIGIV has been the USG, specifically HHS. On June 3, 2019, we announced a contract award by HHS valued at approximately $535 million over 10 years for the continued supply of VIGIV into the SNS for smallpox preparedness.


Therapeutics Product Candidates
The chart below highlights several of our Therapeutics business unit pipeline product candidates:

Product Candidate | Target Indication 
COVID-EIG(Equine-derived polyclonal hyperimmune with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2) | Potential treatment of severe COVID-19 disease. 
COVID-HIG(Human polyclonal hyperimmune with antibodies to SARS-CoV2) | Potential treatment of COVID-19 disease in severe hospitalized patients and post-exposure prophylaxis in individuals at high risk of exposure, such as front-line workers and military personnel.
FLU-IGIV (Human polyclonal hyperimmune with antibodies to Influenza A) | Treatment of Influenza A infection in hospitalized patients. 

Contract Development and Manufacturing
Our CDMO business unit is based on our established development and manufacturing infrastructure, technology platforms and expertise, as well as continuing capital expenditure projects to expand our capabilities. 
Our CDMO portfolio consists of development services, bulk drug substance manufacturing, fill, finish, and packaging of final drug product, or "molecule-to-market" offerings. These services are provided for innovator biopharmaceutical companies, government agencies and non-government organizations. The biologics technology platforms consist of mammalian, microbial, viral, plasma and gene therapy. 
We have nine development and manufacturing sites spread across multiple locations in the United States, 

Canada and Switzerland. Five of these sites currently provide CDMO services to customers and the others are either ready now or in various stages of investment to advance them for servicing CDMO customers.
•Our Winnipeg and Gaithersburg sites house our development services expertise;
•Our Bayview, Lansing, Winnipeg, Bern and Canton sites house our drug substance expertise; and 
•Our Camden, Winnipeg, Rockville and Hattiesburg sites house our drug product expertise. 


We currently have over 50 CDMO customers. Below is a description of the largest CDMO arrangements awarded during 2020.
BARDA COVID-19 Public-Private Partnership. On June 1, 2020, we announced that we had been issued a task order under our existing Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADM) agreement with BARDA for COVID-19 vaccine development and manufacturing. The task order has a contract value of up to $628 million and includes the reservation of manufacturing capacity valued at $542.7 million and $85.5 million for accelerating the planned expansion of viral and non-viral drug product fill/finish capacity.
Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine Arrangement. On July 2, 2020, we executed a large scale drug substance manufacturing agreement related to Johnson & Johnson's lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate for up to five years beginning in 2021. The first two years are valued at approximately $480 million, with the remaining three years providing optional flexible capacity to support volume commitments. This agreement was preceded by an agreement executed in April 2020 valued at approximately $135 million to provide CDMO services and capacity reservation to Johnson & Johnson.
AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine Arrangement. On July 26, 2020, following BARDA direction to release capacity to AstraZeneca, we executed a large-scale drug substance manufacturing agreement related to AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine candidate, valued at approximately $174 million through 2021, which followed an initial agreement, also executed in 2020, valued at approximately $87 million to provide CDMO services and capacity reservation to AstraZeneca.
We also have three capital investment projects in support of the growth of our CDMO business unit. First, we are nearing completion of a $50 million expansion at our Baltimore, Maryland - Camden drug product site, which was announced in 2018 of which approximately $7.5 million is funded by BARDA. Second, we are broadening our drug product capabilities at our Rockville, Maryland site, with $75 million in funding from BARDA. Third, we will be investing $75 million in our Canton, Massachusetts facility, to expand our viral-based service offering to include viral vector and gene therapy capabilities. Together, this represents a $200 million expansion of our manufacturing capability and capacity adding strength, diversity and durability to our network.

Marketing and Sales
Our product sales can be divided into two primary categories: i) sales to governments; and ii) commercial sales.
Government Procurement
For our Vaccines, Therapeutics and Devices business units, our largest customers are the USG and domestic non-government organizations. We also sell certain products to state governments, local governments and emergency management teams. In addition to U.S. sales, we sell our products to governments and non-governmental organizations outside of the United States, primarily to those governments and organizations with which the United States enjoys positive diplomatic relations. For our non-U.S. sales, we use a combination of our employees as well as third-party distributors and representatives to sell our products. 
Commercial Sales
In addition to direct sales primarily to state and local governments as described above, NARCAN® Nasal Spray is sold commercially through physician-directed or standing order prescriptions at retail pharmacies and to first responders including police, firefighters and emergency medical teams. 
Vivotif and Vaxchora are vaccines intended for use by travelers heading to regions where there is a risk of exposure to certain infectious diseases and, therefore, are sold to channels that address travel health. We sell to both wholesalers and distributors as well as directly to healthcare practitioners. The primary commercial customers of Vivotif and Vaxchora are private travel clinics, retail pharmacies and integrated hospital networks. Sales of these products were significantly reduced beginning in 2020 due to a sustained decline in international travel resulting from COVID-19 and we expect limited sales of these products in 2021 due to continuing travel disruptions.
Our CDMO business unit is supported by a dedicated group of sales and business development, marketing and customer experience, and commercial operations professionals qualified to represent our full breadth of service offerings to the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry and governments/non-government organizations.
Competition
 Our products and any product or product candidate that we acquire or successfully develop and commercialize are likely to compete with current products and product candidates that are in development for the same indications. Specifically, the competition for our products and product candidates includes the following:


•AV7909 and BioThrax®. AV7909 and BioThrax are currently procured, primarily by the USG, for prevention of anthrax disease. While there are no vaccines, other than BioThrax, approved by the FDA for prevention of anthrax disease, and none other than AV7909 and BioThrax that are currently procured by the SNS, we face potential future competition for the supply of anthrax vaccines if the USG chooses to procure products or product candidates for any programs currently in development. Altimmune, Inc., GC Pharma, Blue Willow Biologics, and Greffex are each currently developing anthrax vaccine product candidates, which are in various stages of clinical development. Of the product candidates, Altimmune announced completion of enrollment of a Phase 1 trial in August, 2020 and Blue Willow Biologics announced FDA clearance to begin Phase 1 study in October 2019.
•NARCAN® (naloxone HCl) Nasal Spray. NARCAN®Nasal Spray is the first FDA-approved intranasal naloxone spray for the emergency reversal of opioid overdoses. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. and its Canadian affiliate (collectively, Teva) have filed applications for generic versions of an intranasal naloxone spray based on NARCAN®Nasal Spray with the FDA and Health Canada. Teva has not launched its generic product in either jurisdiction, but may launch at risk, despite our patent infringement litigation (described in more detail below) that is currently proceeding against them. NARCAN®Nasal Spray also faces branded competition from other injectable naloxone, auto-injectors and improvised nasal kits, including Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc's. naloxone injection product and Kaléo's EVZIO™ (naloxone HCI injection) Auto-Injector and Teleflex Medical Inc's Intranasal Mucosal Atomization Device. NARCAN®Nasal Spray may face additional generic and branded competition in the future. 
•ACAM2000®. ACAM2000® faces competition from JYNNEOSTM, which is licensed by the FDA for the prevention of smallpox and monkeypox disease in adults 18 years of age and older determined to be at high risk for smallpox or monkeypox infection. JYNNEOS is also approved in Canada and in the European Union under the trade names IMVAMUNE and IMVANEX, respectively. ACAM2000 remains the primary smallpox vaccine stockpiled by the USG and offers key features for public health mass vaccination programs that are critical, including a single dose vaccination schedule and multi-dose vial presentation. 

While therapeutics generally do not compete directly with vaccines, our sales to the USG are dependent upon U.S. policy of stockpiling vaccines for emergency use. There is an approved smallpox therapeutic in the United States made by SIGA Technologies, Inc. (Siga) and in the event USG policy regarding smallpox vaccine and therapeutic stockpiling was to change, our sales could be adversely affected.
•Raxibacumab and Anthrasil®. Our raxibacumab product is the first FDA licensed fully human anthrax monoclonal antibody therapeutic and Anthrasil is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of inhalational anthrax in adult and pediatric patients in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs. However, Elusys Therapeutics, Inc. has obtained FDA licensure for Anthim® (obiltoxaximab) injection, a chimeric (or "partially human") antibody indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax. Obiltoxaximab is also approved in Canada and the EU.
•BAT®. Our botulinum antitoxin immune globulin product is the only heptavalent therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of symptomatic botulism. Direct competition is currently limited.
•VIGIV. Our VIGIV product is the only therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada to address adverse events from smallpox vaccination with replicating virus smallpox vaccines. While direct competition in terms of the treatment of smallpox vaccination side effects is limited, SIGA has obtained FDA approval for TPOXX® (tecovirimat), an oral therapy for the treatment of smallpox disease TPOXX® is currently procured by the SNS. Chimerix is also developing brincidofovir, a nucleotide analog lipid conjugate for treatment of smallpox. 
•RSDL®. In the United States, the RSDL Kit is the only medical device cleared by the FDA to remove or neutralize chemical warfare agents and T-2 toxin from the skin. Internationally, various Ministries of Defense have procured Fullers Earth, Dutch Powder and French Powder as a preparedness countermeasure for the decontamination of liquid chemical weapons from the skin.
•Vivotif®. Vivotif is the only FDA-approved oral typhoid vaccine. In the markets where Vivotif is licensed, it competes primarily with Sanofi Pasteur’s Typhim VI® vaccine, an injectable polysaccharide typhoid vaccine.


•Vaxchora®. In the United States, Vaxchora is the only FDA-licensed vaccine available indicated to prevent cholera. Vaxchora is subject to competition by Valneva's Dukoral® cholera vaccine in the EU. 
We also compete for CDMO services with a number of biopharmaceutical product development organizations, contract manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products and university research laboratories. 
•CDMO Services Business. Companies with which we compete for CDMO services include, among others: Lonza Group Ltd., Catalent, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific, FUJIFILM Dionsynth Biotechnologies. We also compete with in-house research, development and support service departments of other biopharmaceutical companies.
Geographical Reliance
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company's revenue from U.S. customers as a percentage of total revenues were 93%, 90% and 91%, respectively.
MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS
Our development and manufacturing network allows us to deploy capabilities and capacity for clinical and commercial supply needs. 
Supplies and Raw Materials
We currently rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to manufacture some of the supplies we require for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, as well as supplies and raw materials used in the production of our products. Typically, we acquire these supplies and raw materials on a purchase order basis and, when possible, in quantities we believe adequate to meet our needs. We obtain Alhydrogel® adjuvant 2%, used to manufacture AV7909 and BioThrax, from a single-source supplier for which we have no alternative source of supply. However, we maintain stored supplies of this adjuvant in quantities believed to be sufficient to meet our expected manufacturing needs. We also utilize single-source suppliers for other raw materials in our manufacturing processes.
We utilize single source suppliers for all components of NARCAN® Nasal Spray. It is manufactured by a third party, which operates a full service offering from formulation to final packaging. Materials for production of NARCAN® Nasal Spray, such as the naloxone active pharmaceutical ingredient and other excipients, along with the vial, stopper and device are produced around the world by other third parties and delivered to the primary manufacturer and 

released to manufacturing following appropriate testing.
We rely on single source suppliers for our plasma collection to support the Anthrasil, VIGIV and BAT programs. We work closely with our suppliers for these specialty programs and operate under long term agreements. We order quantities of material in advance in quantities believed to be sufficient to meet upcoming demand requirements. 
The rapid demand for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics in light of the current pandemic has caused significant demand for raw materials for the vaccine and therapeutics we are manufacturing. The USG has invoked the Defense Production Act to prioritize our ability to obtain some of these raw materials, but there is still competition from other manufacturers of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics that may limit our ability to manufacture on a timely basis.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We actively seek to protect intellectual property related to our Company's assets, including patent rights, trademark rights, trade secrets and proprietary confidential information, through defense and enforcement of existing rights and pursuit of protection on new and arising innovations. The duration of and the type of protection for patent rights depends upon many factors including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions or administrative term adjustments, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patents. We are a party to various license agreements, including those under which we license patents, patent applications, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. It is our policy to ethically consider the enforcement and defense of our intellectual property rights, and to respect the intellectual property rights of others. We are currently in litigation with Teva to enforce our patents related to NARCAN® Nasal Spray as described in greater detail below. 
REGULATION
Regulations in the United States and other countries have a significant impact on our product development, manufacturing and marketing activities.
Government Contracting
Our status as a USG contractor means that we are subject to various statutes and regulations, including:


•the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and agency-specific regulations supplemental to FAR, which comprehensively regulate the award, formation, administration and performance of government contracts;
•the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARs) and agency-specific regulations supplemental to DFARs, which comprehensively regulate the award, formation, administration and performance of DoD government contracts;
•the Department of State Acquisition Regulation (DOSAR) which regulates the relationship between a Department of State organization and a contractor or potential contractor;
•business ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and incorporate other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, the False Claims Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;
•export and import control laws and regulations, including but not limited to ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations); and
•laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.
USG agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors for compliance with applicable laws and standards. These regulations can impose stricter penalties than those normally applicable to commercial contracts, such as criminal and civil liability and suspension and debarment from future government contracting. In addition, pursuant to various regulations, our government contracts can be subject to unilateral termination or modification by the government for convenience, detailed auditing and accounting systems requirements, statutorily controlled pricing, sourcing and subcontracting restrictions and statutorily mandated processes for adjudicating contract disputes.
The Project BioShield Act of 2004. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 (Project BioShield) was enacted to augment market incentives for companies pursuing the development of MCMs of which the government is the only significant market. Project BioShield provided $5.6 billion over 10 years to develop, purchase, and stockpile MCMs for use in a public health emergency 

against Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear agents.
The Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006 and Reauthorization Acts. The Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006 (PAHPA) established a new, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within HHS; provided new authorities for a number of programs, including the creation of BARDA for the advanced research and development and procurement of MCMs for CBRN threats and emerging infectious diseases. The Pandemic All Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (PAHPRA) continued BARDA’s role and reauthorized Project BioShield funding through fiscal year 2018 and provided BARDA with additional appropriations to support advanced research and development. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2019 (PAHPAIA) reauthorized Project BioShield’s special reserve fund and authorized 10-year funding for product development. BARDA has used the incentives under Project BioShield and subsequent reauthorizations of it to build a robust pipeline of MCMs for multiple CBRN threat agents. It has also procured and stockpiled many of our related products for potential use in the event of a public health threat emergency, including BioThrax, ACAM2000, Anthrasil, BAT, VIGIV and raxibacumab.
Funding for BARDA is provided by annual appropriations by Congress. Congress appropriates annual funding for procurements of MCMs for the SNS (currently managed by ASPR) and for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to conduct biodefense research. This appropriation funding supplements amounts available under Project BioShield.
Emergency Use Authorization
As amended by Project BioShield and subsequent legislation, including PAHPRA and the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDCA permits the Secretary of HHS to authorize the introduction into interstate commerce of unapproved MCMs, or approved MCMs for unapproved uses, in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been declared by designated government officials (known as “emergency use”). The types of emergencies that trigger these authorities include public health emergencies announced by the Secretary of HHS, military emergencies announced by the Secretary of Defense, domestic emergencies announced by the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the identification of a material threat pursuant to Section 319-F-2 of the PHSA that is sufficient to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad. After one of the emergencies has been announced, the Secretary of HHS may authorize the issuance of, and the FDA Commissioner may issue, EUAs for the use of specific products based on criteria established by statute, 


including that the product at issue may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by (CBRN) threat agents when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. EUAs are subject to additional conditions and restrictions, are product-specific, and terminate when the emergency determination underlying the EUA terminates.
Under PAHPRA,the USG may also, at its discretion, purchase critical biodefense products for the SNS prior to FDA approval after the filing of a pre-EUA application with the FDA. BARDA is currently procuring AV7909 from us pursuant to this authority, a product candidate which has not yet been approved by the FDA.
Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) creates liability immunity for manufacturers of MCMs when the Secretary of HHS issues a declaration for their manufacture, administration or use. A PREP Act declaration is intended to provide liability immunity from claims under federal or state law for loss arising out of the administration or use of a covered MCM under a government contract. The Secretary of HHS has issued PREP Act declarations identifying BioThrax, ACAM2000, raxibacumab, Anthrasil, BAT and VIGIV, as covered MCMs. 
Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technology Act of 2002 (SAFETY Act). The SAFETY Act was enacted to create liability limitations for qualifying anti-terrorism technologies for claims arising from or related to an act of terrorism. BioThrax and RSDL are certified anti-terrorism products covered under the SAFETY Act. Although we are covered by the benefits of the SAFETY Act for BioThrax and RSDL, it may not provide adequate protection from all claims made against us.
Product Development for Therapeutics and Vaccines
Pre-Clinical Testing. We generally perform pre-clinical safety and efficacy testing on our product candidates before we initiate clinical trials.
Animal Rule. Conducting controlled clinical trials with human patients to determine efficacy may sometimes be unethical or unfeasible. Under the “Animal Rule,” under some circumstances, approval of product candidates can be based on clinical data from trials in healthy subjects that demonstrate adequate safety and immunogenicity as well as efficacy data from animal studies. 
Investigational New Drug Application. Before clinical testing may begin, the results of pre-clinical testing and other available clinical data must be submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The data must provide an 

adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical studies. 
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve administration of a product candidate to healthy human volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified physician under an FDA-reviewed protocol. Initial human clinical trials typically are conducted in the following three sequential phases. 
•Phase 1 involves introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects and early evidence of effectiveness.
•Phase 2 involves studies to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications, explore tolerance, optimal dosage, and safety risks.
•Phase 3 trials must demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, and permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and provide adequate information for drug labeling. 
Phase 4 studies may also be conducted following marketing approval to provide additional data related to drug use. The FDA may impose a temporary or permanent clinical hold, or other sanctions, if it believes that a clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. 
Good Clinical Practice. All phases of clinical studies must be conducted in conformance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practices (GCP) which are ethical and scientific quality standards for conducting clinical trials.
Marketing Approval – Biologics, Drugs and Vaccines
Biologics License Application/New Drug Application. For large molecule products, such as vaccines, products derived from blood and blood components, and antibodies, all data obtained from a development program, including research and product development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical trials, labeling and related information are submitted in a biologics license application (BLA) to the FDA and in similar regulatory filings with the corresponding agencies in other countries for review and approval. For small molecule drugs, this information is submitted in a new drug application (NDA) filing. The submission of an application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find the application complete and accept it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted. Most applications 


are subject to a substantial application fee and, if approved, will be assessed an annual fee. Under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), the FDA has the authority to grant waivers of certain user fees.
In reviewing a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant approval, request more information or data, or deny the application if it determines the application does not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness and/or that the drug is not safe for use under the conditions of use in the proposed labeling. The FDA will also typically inspect one or more clinical sites to ensure compliance with GCPs as well as the facility or facilities at which the candidate is manufactured to ensure compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs).
We currently intend to submit a BLA to the FDA for AV7909 by the end of 2021. The receipt of regulatory approval may take many years, and typically involves the expenditure of substantial financial resources. Accordingly, there can be no assurances we will receive approval for AV7909 from the FDA. The FDA may also impose conditions upon approval or significantly limit the indications approved for a given product and/or require, as a condition of approval, enhanced labeling, packaging, post-approval clinical trials, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials or restrictions on consumer advertising, which could negatively impact the commercial success of a product.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications and Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications. Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval under an NDA for innovator products, or an abbreviated new drug application for generic products. Relevant to ANDAs, the Hatch-Waxman amendments to the FDCA established a statutory procedure for submission and FDA review and approval of ANDAs for generic versions of branded drugs previously approved by the FDA (RLDs)). Because the safety and efficacy of RLDs have already been established by the brand company (sometimes referred to as the innovator), the FDA does not require ANDA applicants to independently demonstrate safety and efficacy of generic products. However, a generic manufacturer is typically required to demonstrate bioequivalence (i.e. that their product performs in the same manner). Bioequivalence is established when there is an absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent for absorption of the generic product and the listed drug. 
The third alternative is commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy of an existing product in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an 

NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings with respect to certain pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for certain label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the applicant.
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents of the applicant or that are held by third parties whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any subsequent applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make one of the following certifications to the FDA concerning patents: (1) the patent information concerning the RLD has not been submitted to the FDA; (2) any such patent that was filed has expired; (3) the date on which such patent will expire; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. 
If the RLD’s NDA holder or patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired. 
Although NARCAN Nasal Spray is protected by patents covering its manufacture, formulation, distribution system and method of use, multiple third parties have filed ANDAs seeking FDA approval of generic versions of NARCAN Nasal Spray. Notwithstanding our patents, it is possible that once its application is approved, an ANDA filer could introduce a competing naloxone hydrochloride product before our patents expire if it is determined that it does not infringe our patents, or that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, or if such company or 


companies decide, before applicable ongoing patent litigation is concluded, to launch a naloxone hydrochloride product at risk of being held liable for damages for patent infringement. As discussed herein, the FDA has approved the first ANDA for a generic version of NARCAN Nasal Spray.
Post-Approval Requirements. Any drug, biologic or medical device product for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, cGMPs and restrictions on advertising and promotion. Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product’s distribution or use and, potentially, withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. The FDA may also require post-approval clinical trials and/or safety labeling changes. 
Facilities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to be registered with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other laws. 
A company that is found to have improperly promoted unapproved or off-label uses or otherwise not to have met applicable promotion rules may be subject to significant liability under both the FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act.
Vaccine and Therapeutic Product Lot Protocol. Because the manufacturing process for biological products is complex, the FDA requires for many biologics, including most vaccines and immune globulin products, that each product lot undergo thorough testing for purity, potency, identity and sterility. Several of our vaccines are subject to lot release protocols by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. 
 Marketing Approval – Devices
Devices may fall within the definition of a Medical Device or may be a Combination Product including both a device for delivery of a drug product and the drug product itself. Medical Devices are also subject to FDA clearance or approval and extensive regulation under the FDCA. 
Medical devices are classified into one of three classes -- Class I, Class II or Class III - depending on the degree of risk and the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of each medical device. Medical devices deemed to pose lower risks are generally placed in either Class I or II. Pre-market review and clearance by the FDA for Class I and II medical devices is accomplished through a 

pre-market notification procedure, unless the device is exempt. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-supporting or implantable devices, are generally placed in Class III. 
Both before and after a medical device is commercially distributed, manufacturers and marketers of the device have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, record keeping, reports of adverse events, labeling and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Device manufacturers are subject to periodic and unannounced inspection by the FDA for compliance with cGMP requirements.
A combination product is a product comprising of two or more regulated components (e.g., a drug and device) that are combined into a single product, co-packaged, or sold separately but intended for co-administration, as evidenced by the labeling for the products. Like their constituent products—e.g., drugs and devices—combination products are highly regulated and subject to a broad range of post marketing requirements including cGMPs, adverse event reporting, periodic reports, labeling and advertising and promotion requirements and restrictions, market withdrawal and recall. 
The FDA also administers certain controls over the export of medical devices from the United States, as international sales of medical devices that have not received FDA approval are subject to FDA export requirements.
Regulation Outside of the U.S.
Currently, we maintain a commercial presence in the United States and Canada as well as certain other countries. In the European Union, medicinal products are authorized following a process that is similarly demanding as the process required in the United States. Medicinal products must be authorized in one of two ways, either through the decentralized procedure, which provides for the mutual recognition procedure of national approval decisions by the competent authorities of the European Union (EU) Member States or through the centralized procedure by the European Commission, which provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. Each foreign country subjects medical devices to its own regulatory requirements. We are also subject to many of the same continuing post-approval requirements in the EU as we are in the United States (e.g., good manufacturing practices). 
Potential Sanctions.


For all FDA-regulated products, if the FDA finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or that a product is ineffective or poses an unreasonable health risk, it can institute or seek a wide variety of enforcement actions and remedies, including but not limited to:
•restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;
•restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;
•restrictions on distribution or use of a product;
•requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;
•warning letters or untitled letters;
•withdrawal of the products from the market;
•refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that are submitted;
•recall of products;
•fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;
•suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;
•refusal to permit the import or export of our products;
•product seizure; and
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
Health regulatory authorities in other countries have similar rules and regulations although the specifics vary jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
Fraud, Abuse and Anti-Corruption Laws
The United States and most other jurisdictions have detailed requirements that apply to government and private health care programs, and a broad range of fraud and abuse laws, transparency laws, and other laws. Relevant U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute;
•The False Claims Act;
•The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act;
•The price reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992;

•The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program; and
•Analogous and similar state laws and regulations. 
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to criminal or civil penalties.
Our operations are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA by the activities of our partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents. As a public company, the FCPA also requires us to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all of our transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our operations are also subject to compliance with the U.K. Bribery Act, which applies to bribery activities both in the public and private sector, Canada’s Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and similar laws in other countries.
Regulations Governing Reimbursement
The marketing practices of U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers are also subject to federal and state healthcare laws related to government funded healthcare programs.
In the United States, certain of our products are reimbursed under federal and state health care programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, TriCare, and or state pharmaceutical assistance programs. Many foreign countries have similar laws.
Various U.S. federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federally funded health care programs, including federal and state anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, and anti-self-referral laws, which may apply to federal and state-funded Medicaid and other health care programs and private third-party payers.
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to criminal or civil penalties.
Additionally, drug pricing is an active area for regulatory reform at the federal and state levels, and significant changes to current drug pricing and reimbursement structures in the United States. continue to be enacted and considered.


Data Privacy Laws
A number of states in the United States have passed or introduced bills, which, if passed, impose operational requirements on U.S. companies similar to the requirements reflected in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which came into effect on January 1, 2020, requires covered companies that process personal information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new private right of action for data breaches. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorney generals are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The compliance and other burdens imposed by the EU's GDPR, CCPA and similar privacy laws and regulations may be substantial as they are subject to differing interpretations and implementation among jurisdictions. The restrictions imposed by such laws may require us to modify our data handling practices and impose additional compliance costs and burdens.
Other Industry Regulation
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export, use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents used in connection with our product development, are or may be applicable to our officers, directors and 10% stockholders pursuant to Section 16 under the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after copies of those filings are provided to us by those persons. In addition, we intend to make available on our website all disclosures that are required to be posted by applicable law, the rules of the SEC or the New York Stock Exchange listing standards regarding any amendment to, or waiver of, our code of business conduct and ethics. We have included our website address as an inactive textual reference only. The information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
HUMAN CAPITAL
We value the diversity of each of our employees and the contributions they make to helping us achieve our mission to protect and enhance life. We are 

committed to working together toward our long-term aspiration to protect and enhance one billion lives by 2030. One of the five core objectives of our current 2020-2024 strategic plan is to evolve the culture of our organization consistent with our strategic objectives and our values. We strive to create an environment that is professionally and personally rewarding by offering challenging work and projects for individual and team contribution, and opportunities for professional and personal development. Another core objective of our current strategic plan is to build scalable capabilities; this objective includes continuing to invest in growing and developing leadership, innovation and engagement at all levels of our workforce. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,200 employees. 
Health, Wellness and Safety
Employee safety and well-being is of paramount importance to us and was of particular focus in 2020 in light of COVID-19. In response to the pandemic, we adjusted our operations to ensure that only operation-critical development and manufacturing employees worked on-site, and we transitioned all other employees to remote work, providing productivity and collaboration tools and resources for them 
Ensuring the health and safety of our on-site employees demanded increased attention. We provided personal protective equipment to them and implemented new safety protocols. These included re-engineered workplace designs that facilitate physical distancing, temperature screening and access to COVID-19 testing. Frequency and methods of communication between management and employees was increased with regular all-hands virtual meetings to discuss what we were doing as a company to combat COVID-19 in conjunction with our USG and private sector partners, and what we were doing to protect our workers. 
In addition, we enhanced and promoted programs to support our employees’ physical and mental well-being. For example, in 2020 we provided supplemental paid time off to employees who were unable to work due to COVID-19 symptoms or diagnosis, or even to deal with family COVID issues. We arranged and paid for COVID-19 tests for people who work on-site. We also partnered with a leading provider of online mental health support and counseling to maintain and expand our employees’ access to offered mental health resources. 
Hiring and Talent Management 
In 2020, we hired approximately 700 new employees. More than 250 of these new hires were hired to work with numerous company employees in new roles working on our public-private partnership with the USG and other innovators related to 


COVID-19. We have consistent talent processes and systems across the company including performance management, training and development and succession planning. We use the Gallup Q12 instrument to measure employee engagement progress on an annual basis. 
Compensation and Benefits
Our programs support our pay-for-performance philosophy and enhance our total compensation package. Competitive bonuses and equity awards are granted subject to eligibility based on company and individual performance. We focus on results and behavior because we value how we do things as much as getting them done. We practice salary transparency whereby certain information is shared to enhance employees' transparency into the salaries they receive, which helps employees become more knowledgeable and confident their pay is fair and competitive. We recognize the need for ongoing skill enhancement and support continued learning through on-the-job assignments, training programs, tuition assistance, professional memberships and professional conference attendance. This past year, to thank employees for the extra-ordinary effort they gave during unprecedented times, leadership made a non-recurring special equity award with immediate vesting that was provided to all employees below the senior vice president level.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Commitment 
Diversity, equity and inclusion are integral parts of our culture. We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent reflecting a diversity of ideas, backgrounds, and perspectives. Diversity drives innovation in the products and services we develop, in the way we solve problems, and in the way we serve the needs of an increasingly global and diverse customer and partner base. We recognize the value that diversity contributes to our global organization and the competitive advantage we can maintain by having a broad range of talents, perspectives, and ideas with a commitment to continuously improving our business. We ensure every employee is treated fairly and equitably. We are also a proud supporter of our military veterans. We value the diversity that each employee brings, and while we look for people who share our core values, we thrive on our differences. Employees come from different backgrounds and take on a wide variety of roles, but they are all working toward the same mission — to protect and enhance life. 
Social, Environmental, and Community Responsibility 
Our mission to protect and enhance life applies not only to the products and services that we deliver, but also to how we are cognizant of our social and 

environmental responsibilities as well as serve the communities in which we live and work. Starting in 2012, we established a platform, that we call eGIVE (Give, Invest, Volunteer), that we have continued to expand since its inception. Through this platform, we have encouraged employees to make contributions to select charitable organizations and volunteer their time, which we have supported with paid time off to support socially responsible activities. 
As our organization has grown, we have continually explored ways in which we can have impact at broader scale. To that end, in December 2020, we initiated a comprehensive enterprise-wide Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) project to understand our current and desired ESG profile, engage internal and external stakeholders in the ESG conversation, identify priority ESG action items and issue our maiden sustainability report focused on our ESG initiatives by the end of 2021, consistent with our corporate strategy and our commitment to the communities in which we operate.
