      ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  GENERAL 
         We are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products and of inorganic chemical products. Our Company, a Delaware corporation, was formed in 2004 to hold the businesses of Huntsman Holdings, LLC, a company founded by Jon M. Huntsman. Mr. Huntsman founded the predecessor to our Company in 1970 as a small polystyrene plastics packaging company. Since then, we have grown through a series of significant acquisitions and now own a global portfolio of businesses. 
         We operate all of our businesses through Huntsman International, our 100% owned subsidiary. Huntsman International is a Delaware limited liability company and was formed in 1999. 
         Our principal executive offices are located at 10003 Woodloch Forest Drive, The Woodlands, Texas 77380, and our telephone number at that location is (281) 719-6000. 
   RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
         On January 30, 2017, our titanium dioxide manufacturing facility in Pori, Finland experienced fire damage and is currently not operational. The fire brigade responded quickly to extinguish the fire and there were no injuries. We have notified applicable customers and suppliers of this force majeure event. We do not currently have an estimated time frame for how long the facility will be off line, but we are committed to repairing the facility as quickly as possible. The Pori facility has a nameplate capacity of 130,000 metric tons, which represents approximately 15% of our total titanium dioxide capacity and approximately 10% of total European titanium dioxide demand. The site is insured for property damage as well as business interruption losses. According to our insurance policies, the respective retention levels (deductibles) for physical damage and business interruption are $15 million and 60 days, respectively. On February 9, 2017, we received a €50 million (approximately $52 million) payment from our insurer as an initial partial progress payment towards the overall pending claim. 
         On October 28, 2016, we filed an initial Form 10 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") as part of the process to spin off our Pigments and Additives and Textile Effects businesses in a tax-free transaction. On January 17, 2017, we announced that we will retain our Textile Effects business and we amended the Form 10 registration statement. We also announced that the name of the spin-off entity will be Venator Materials Corporation ("Venator"). Venator shares are expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker VNTR after the distribution to our stockholders. The completion of the spin-off is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the registration statement on Form 10 for Venator's common stock being declared effective by the SEC and certain other conditions described in the information statement included in the Form 10. The ongoing process to separate the Pigments and Additives business is proceeding and is targeted for the second quarter 2017. As noted above, there was fire damage sustained at our titanium dioxide facility in Pori, Finland. The potential impact of this interruption, if any, on the spin date is not yet known. 
         On December 30, 2016, our Performance Products segment completed the sale of its European surfactants business to Innospec Inc. for $199 million in cash plus our retention of trade receivables and payables for an enterprise value of $225 million. Under the terms of the transaction, Innospec acquired our manufacturing facilities located in Saint-Mihiel, France; Castiglione delle Stiviere, Italy; and Barcelona, Spain. The purchase price is subject to the finalization of working capital adjustments. We remain committed to our global surfactants business, including in the U.S. and Australia, where our differentiated surfactants businesses are backward integrated into essential feedstocks. Upon closing the transaction, we entered into supply and long-term tolling arrangements with Innospec in order to continue marketing certain core products strategic to our global agrochemicals, lubes and certain other 
 1

   businesses. In connection with this sale, we recognized a pre-tax gain in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $98 million. 
         On December 30, 2016, we made an early repayment of $260 million on our 2015 extended term loan B facility due 2019 ("2015 Extended Term Loan B") using proceeds from the sale of the European surfactants business and existing cash. 
   OVERVIEW 
         We operate in five segments: Polyurethanes, Performance Products, Advanced Materials, Textile Effects and Pigments and Additives. Our products comprise a broad range of chemicals and formulations which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers. Our products are used in a wide range of applications, including those in the adhesives, aerospace, automotive, construction products, personal care and hygiene, durable and non-durable consumer products, electronics, medical, packaging, paints and coatings, power generation, refining, synthetic fiber, textile chemicals and dye industries. We are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including MDI, amines, surfactants, maleic anhydride, epoxy-based polymer formulations, textile chemicals, dyes, titanium dioxide and color pigments. Our administrative, research and development and manufacturing operations are primarily conducted at the facilities listed in "Item 2. Properties" below, which are located in 29 countries. 
         As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 15,000 associates worldwide. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $9,657 million, $10,299 million and $11,578 million, respectively. 
   Our Products 
         We produce differentiated organic and inorganic chemical products. Our Polyurethanes, Performance Products, Advanced Materials and Textile Effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our Pigments and Additives segment produces primarily inorganic chemical products. 
         Growth in our differentiated products has been driven by the substitution of our products for other materials and by the level of global economic activity. Accordingly, the profitability of our differentiated products has been somewhat less influenced by the cyclicality that typically impacts the petrochemical industry. Titanium dioxide, within our Pigments and Additives segment, is cyclical and influenced by seasonal demand patterns in the coatings industry.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Form 10-K. 
   Polyurethanes 
   General 
         We are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of polyurethane chemicals, including MDI products, PO, polyols, PG and TPU (each discussed in more detail below under "Products and Markets"). Polyurethane chemicals are used to produce rigid and flexible foams, as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers. We focus on the higher-margin, higher-growth markets for specialty MDI and MDI-based polyurethane systems. Growth in our Polyurethanes segment has been driven primarily by the continued substitution of MDI-based products for other materials across a broad range of applications. We operate five primary polyurethane manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Europe and China. We also operate 19 strategically located downstream polyurethane formulation facilities, commonly referred to in the chemical industry as "systems houses," located in close proximity to our customers worldwide (see facilities listed in "Item 2. Properties" below), which enables us to focus on customer support, technical service and a differentiated product offering. We also operate a specialty polyol manufacturing facility focused on the insulation market and three downstream TPU manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Europe and China. 
         Our customers produce polyurethane products through the combination of an isocyanate, such as MDI, with polyols, which are derived largely from PO and EO. We are able to produce over 2,000 distinct MDI-based polyurethane products by modifying the MDI molecule through varying the proportion and type of polyol used and by introducing other chemical additives to our MDI formulations. As a result, polyurethane products, especially those derived from MDI, are continuing to replace traditional products in a wide range of end-use markets, including insulation in construction and appliances, cushioning for automotive and furniture, coatings, adhesives, wood binders for construction and furniture, footwear and other specialized engineering applications. 
         We are one of three North American producers of PO. We and some of our customers process PO into derivative products, such as polyols for polyurethane products, PG and various other chemical products. End uses for these derivative products include applications in the home furnishings, construction, appliances, packaging, automotive and transportation, food, paints and coatings and cleaning products industries. We also produce MTBE as a co-product of our PO manufacturing process. MTBE is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors." 
         In 1992, we were the first global supplier of polyurethane chemicals to open a technical service center in China. We have since expanded this facility to include an integrated polyurethanes formulation facility and a world scale research and development campus. In January 2003, we entered into two related joint ventures to build MDI production and finishing facilities near Shanghai, China in Caojing. In June 2006, HPS, a consolidated joint venture, began production at our MDI finishing plant. In September 2006, SLIC, an unconsolidated joint venture, began production at the MNB, aniline and crude MDI plants. We intend to expand the capacity of these facilities by 2018. These world-scale facilities strengthen our ability to service our customers in the critical Chinese market, the largest MDI market in the world, and will support the long-term demand growth that we believe this region will continue to experience. Additionally, in November 2012, we entered into an agreement with Sinopec to form a joint venture to build a world scale PO/MTBE plant in Nanjing, China. The facility is expected to be mechanically complete in early 2017 with beneficial commercial operations expected in the second half of 2017, and will utilize our proprietary PO/MTBE manufacturing technology. We own a 49% 
 5

   interest in the joint venture and account for our interest in the joint venture as an equity method investment. 
   Products and Markets 
         MDI is used primarily in rigid foam applications and in a wide variety of customized, higher-value flexible foam as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers. Polyols, including polyether and polyester polyols, are used in conjunction with MDI in rigid foam, flexible foam and other non-foam applications. PO is one of the principal raw materials for producing polyether polyols. The following chart illustrates the range of product types and end uses for polyurethane chemicals. 
 
        Polyurethane chemicals are sold to customers who combine the chemicals to produce polyurethane products. Depending on their needs, customers will use either component polyurethane chemicals produced for mass sales or polyurethane systems tailored for their specific requirements. By varying the blend, additives and specifications of the polyurethane chemicals, manufacturers are able to develop and produce a breadth and variety of polyurethane products. 
         Our strategy is focused on growing our differentiated product offering (specialty MDI and polyols, formulated MDI systems and TPU), which requires a greater emphasis on formulating capability to provide our downstream customers with the end effect required in their applications These differentiated products tend to require technical solutions, offer higher margins, lower volatility and are less dependent on industry utilization rates compared to sales of component MDI or component polyols. 
  MDI.    MDI has grown substantially over the past three decades, increasing by a factor of 6% or 7% CAGR, well in excess of global GDP. MDI has a substantially larger market size and a higher growth rate than other polyurethane isocyanates. This is primarily because MDI can be used to make polyurethanes with a broader range of properties and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications. We believe that MDI and formulated MDI systems, which combine MDI and polyols, will continue to grow at approximately double the rate of global GDP driven by the mega trends of energy management, food preservation, demographics and urbanization/transportation. MDI offers key products benefits of energy efficiency, comfort and durability aligned with these megatrends. We believe that MDI and formulated MDI systems will continue to substitute for alternative materials such as fiberglass in insulation, phenol formaldehyde in wood binders and TDI in automotive and furniture. 
 6

   Specialty cushioning and insulation applications, thermoplastic polyurethanes and adhesives and coatings will further contribute to the continued growth of MDI. MDI experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting its exposure to seasonal construction-related end markets such as insulation and composite wood products. Sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year. 
         TPU.    TPU is a high-quality, fully formulated thermal plastic derived from the reaction of MDI or an aliphatic isocyanate with polyols to produce unique qualities such as durability, flexibility, strength, abrasion-resistance, shock absorbency and chemical resistance. We can tailor the performance characteristics of TPU to meet the specific requirements of our customers. TPU is used in injection molding and small components for the automotive and footwear industries. It is also extruded into films for apparel, wires and cables for industrial use and in a wide variety of applications in the coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers markets. 
         Polyols.    Polyols are combined with MDI and other isocyanates to create a broad spectrum of formulated polyurethane systems. Demand for specialty polyols has been growing at approximately the same rate at which MDI consumption has grown. 
  Aniline.    Aniline is an intermediate chemical used primarily to manufacture MDI. The majority of our aniline is consumed internally with some sold to third parties. We believe that the lack of a significant spot market for aniline means that in order to remain competitive, MDI manufacturers must either be integrated with an aniline manufacturing facility or have a long-term, cost-competitive aniline supply contract. 
         PO.    PO is an intermediate chemical used mainly to produce a wide range of polyols and PG. Demand for PO depends largely on overall economic demand, especially that of consumer durables. Strategically, we use PO produced at our world scale PO/MTBE facility in Port Neches, Texas, downstream in our formulated MDI systems. We are also currently constructing a PO/MTBE facility in Nanjing, China with the strategic aim of supplying PO downstream into our China business, accelerating our differentiated growth in the world's largest PU market. In addition, we also have an important internal strategic outlet for PO, downstream into our Performance Products amines business, which generates significant added value to the PO molecule. 
         MTBE.    MTBE is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline. While MTBE has been effectively eliminated in the United States, demand continues to grow in other regions of the world. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors." In 2011, we announced the signing of a license agreement with Chinese chemicals manufacturer Yantai Wanhua Polyurethanes Co., Ltd, for the production of PO and MTBE. In November 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with Sinopec to construct and operate a PO/MTBE facility in China. Under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and Sinopec holds a 51% interest. See "Manufacturing and Operations" below and "Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
         It is important to recognize the strategic link between PO, polyols and MDI. MTBE is a co-product of the PO manufacturing process which generates cash in the gasoline market. Our strategic focus is on growing our differentiated (specialty MDI and polyols, formulated MDI based systems and 
 7

   TPU) sales and the diagram below provides an overview of that focus with an approximation of the number of grades, formulations, products and stock keeping units which we produce and sell. 
 
  Sales and Marketing 
         We market our polyurethane chemicals to over 3,500 customers in more than 90 countries. Our sales, marketing and technical resources are organized to support major regional markets and key end-use markets, some of which requires a coordinated global approach, such as key accounts across the automotive sector. These key end-use markets include the commercial and residential insulation, appliance, automotive, footwear, furniture and coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers industries. We sell both directly and indirectly to customers, the latter via a network of distributors and agents who in turn sell our products to customers who cannot be served as cost effectively by our internal sales groups. 
         We provide a wide variety of polyurethane solutions as components (i.e., the isocyanate or the polyol) or in the form of "systems" in which we provide the total isocyanate and polyol formulation to our customers. Our ability to deliver a range of polyurethane solutions and technical support tailored to meet our customers' needs is critical to our long-term success. We have strategically located our downstream polyurethane systems houses close to our customers, enabling us to focus on customer support and technical service. We believe this customer support and technical service system contributes to customer retention and also provides opportunities for identifying further product and service needs of customers. 
         Our strategy is to grow the number of and capability of our downstream facilities both organically and inorganically. As a result, we have made a number of "bolt-on" acquisitions in recent years to expand our downstream footprint and align with our strategic intent. 
         We believe that the extensive market knowledge and industry experience of our sales teams and technical experts, in combination with our strong emphasis on customer relationships, have facilitated our ability to establish and maintain long-term customer supply positions. Our sales strategy is to continue to increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers by providing innovative solutions, quality products, reliable supply, competitive prices and superior customer service.

     Manufacturing and Operations 
         Our world-scale MDI production facilities are located in Geismar, Louisiana; Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and through our joint ventures in Caojing, China. These facilities receive aniline, which is a primary material used in the production of MDI, from our facilities located in Geismar, Louisiana; Wilton, U.K.; and Caojing, China. We believe that this relative scale and product integration of our large facilities is necessary to provide cost competitiveness in MDI production. The following table sets forth the annual production capacity of polyurethane chemicals at each of our polyurethanes facilities: 

 | | MDI | | Polyols | | TPU | | Aniline | | Nitrobenzene | | PO | | PG | | MTBE |

Represents our approximately 85% share of capacity under our consolidated Rubicon LLC manufacturing joint venture with Chemtura Corporation. 


        At our Geismar, Rotterdam and Caojing facilities we utilize sophisticated proprietary technology to produce MDI. This technology contributes to our position as a low cost MDI producer. In addition to MDI, we use a proprietary manufacturing process to manufacture PO. We own or license all technology and know-how developed and utilized at our PO facility. Our process combines isobutane and oxygen in proprietary oxidation (peroxidation) reactors, thereby forming TBHP and TBA, which are further processed into PO and MTBE, respectively. Because our PO production process is less expensive relative to other technologies and allows PO co-products to be processed into saleable or useable materials, we believe that our PO production technology possesses several distinct advantages over its alternatives. 
   Joint Ventures 
  Rubicon Joint Venture.    Chemtura Corporation is our joint venture partner in Rubicon LLC, which owns aniline, nitrobenzene and DPA manufacturing facilities in Geismar, Louisiana. We are entitled to approximately 85% of the nitrobenzene and aniline production capacity of Rubicon LLC, and Chemtura Corporation is entitled to 100% of the DPA production. In addition to operating the joint venture's aniline, nitrobenzene and DPA facilities, Rubicon LLC operates our wholly-owned MDI, polyol and maleic anhydride facilities at Geismar and is responsible for providing other auxiliary services to the entire Geismar complex. As a result of this joint venture, we are able to achieve greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would otherwise have been able to obtain. Rubicon LLC is consolidated in our financial statements.

 Chinese MDI Joint Ventures.    We are involved in two related joint ventures which operate MDI production facilities in Caojing, China. SLIC, our manufacturing joint venture with BASF and three Chinese chemical companies, produces MNB, aniline and crude MDI. We effectively own 35% of SLIC and account for our investment under the equity method. HPS, our splitting joint venture with Shanghai Chlor-Alkali Chemical Company, Ltd, manufactures pure MDI, polymeric MDI, MDI variants and formulated MDI systems. We own 70% of HPS and it is consolidated in our financial statements. These projects have been funded by a combination of equity invested by the joint venture partners and borrowed funds. The total production capacity of the SLIC facilities is 700 million pounds per year of MDI, of which HPS is entitled to 50%, and the splitting capacity of the HPS facility is 350 million pounds per year of MDI. 
         SLIC is in the process of expanding capacity in Caojing by 530 million pounds per year of MDI and HPS is also expanding splitting capacity. We anticipate that the expansion will be complete with beneficial commercial operations in the first half of 2018. 
         Chinese PO/MTBE Joint Venture.    In November 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with Sinopec. The joint venture involves the construction and operation of a PO/MTBE facility in China. Under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and Sinopec holds a 51% interest. Our total equity investment is anticipated to be approximately $85 million, net of license fees from the joint venture. At the end of 2016, cumulative capital contributions were approximately $85 million, net of license fees from the joint venture. Mechanical completion of the project is expected in early 2017. We expect beneficial commercial operations during the second half of 2017 as soon as supply for the key raw material isobutane is available. 
   Raw Materials 
         The primary raw materials for MDI-based polyurethane chemicals are benzene and PO. Benzene is a widely available commodity that is the primary feedstock for the production of MDI and aniline. Historically, benzene has been the largest component of our raw material costs. We purchase benzene from third parties to manufacture nitrobenzene and aniline, almost all of which we then use to produce MDI. 
         A major cost in the production of polyols is attributable to the costs of PO. The integration of our PO business with our polyurethane chemicals business gives us access to a competitively priced, strategic source of PO and the opportunity to develop polyols that enhance our range of MDI products. The primary raw materials used in our PO production process are butane/isobutane, propylene, methanol and oxygen. 
   Competition 
         Our major competitors in the polyurethane chemicals market include BASF, Covestro, Dow, Wanhua Chemical Group and LyondellBasell. While these competitors and others produce various types and quantities of polyurethane chemicals, we focus on MDI and MDI-based formulated polyurethane systems. Our polyurethane chemicals business competes in two basic ways: (1) where price is the dominant element of competition, our polyurethane chemicals business differentiates itself by its high level of customer support, including cooperation on technical and safety matters; and (2) elsewhere, we compete on the basis of product performance, our ability to react quickly to changing customer needs and providing customers with innovative solutions to their needs.

     Performance Products 
   General 
         Our Performance Products segment has leading global positions in the manufacture and sale of amines, surfactants and maleic anhydride and serves a wide variety of consumer and industrial end markets. Our Performance Products segment is organized by region and product family. Our product families are: Amines; Maleic Anhydride (including catalyst and licensing); Surfactants (including LAB); and Upstream Intermediates. 
         We produce a wide range of amines, many of which are sold into specialty markets such as epoxy curing agents, oil exploration and production, agrochemicals, and fuel and lubricant additives. We believe we are the largest global producer of polyetheramines, one of the largest producers of 2-(2-amino ethoxy) ethanol, sold under our DGA® brand, the second largest producer of ethyleneamines and morpholine and the second largest North American producer of ethanolamines. We are the only producer and largest supplier of propylene carbonate and ethylene carbonate in North America. Many of the markets for these products have growth rates in excess of global GDP. 
         We believe we are the largest global producer of maleic anhydride, a highly versatile chemical intermediate that is used to produce UPRs, which are mainly used in the production of fiberglass reinforced resins for marine, automotive and construction products. Maleic anhydride is also used in the production of lubricants, food additives and artificial sweeteners. We are also the leading licensor of maleic anhydride manufacturing technology and the largest supplier of butane fixed bed catalyst used in maleic anhydride manufacturing. 
         We consume internally produced and third-party-sourced base petrochemicals in the manufacture of our surfactants, LAB and ethanolamines products. We produce a broad range of surfactants, which are primarily used in detergency, personal care, agrochemical, oilfield and industrial applications. We manufacture LAB for use as an intermediate in laundry detergents and a higher molecular weight alkylate used as a lubricant additive. 
         We also use internally produced and third-party-sourced base petrochemicals to produce EG, which is primarily used in the production of polyester fibers, PET packaging and antifreeze. 
         Beginning in 2013, our Performance Products segment initiated a restructuring program to refocus its surfactants business in Europe. In connection with this program, in 2014 we completed the sale of our European commodity surfactants business, including the ethoxylation facility in Lavera, France to Wilmar. Additionally, in 2014 we ceased production at our Patrica, Italy surfactants facility. In December 2015, we announced plans for a reorganization of our commercial and technical functions and a refocused divisional business strategy to better position our segment for growth in coming years and we launched a program to capture growth opportunities, improve manufacturing cost efficiency and reduce inventories. In 2016, we expanded our EO capacity by 265 million pounds at our Port Neches, Texas facility. On December 30, 2016, we completed the sale of our European surfactants business to Innospec Inc. for $199 million in cash plus our retention of trade receivables and payables for an enterprise value of $225 million. We remain committed to our global surfactants business, including in the U.S. and Australia, where our differentiated surfactants businesses are backward integrated into essential feedstocks. 
         We operate 14 Performance Products manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia.

           The following chart illustrates the primary raw materials used and range of product types produced by the Performance Products segment: 
 
  Products and Markets 
  Amines.    Amines are a family of intermediate chemicals that are produced by reacting ammonia with various ethylene and propylene derivatives. Generally, amines are valued for their properties as a reactive agent, emulsifier, dispersant, solvent or corrosion inhibitor. Growth in demand for amines is highly correlated with GDP growth. However, certain segments of the amines market, such as polyetheramines, have historically grown at rates in excess of GDP growth due to new product development, technical innovation and end-use substitution. As amines are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer-specific end-use applications, pricing does not generally fluctuate directly with movements in underlying raw materials. Our Amines business is organized around the following product groups: 

Product Group | Applications 
Polyetheramines | Epoxy composites, polyurethane foams and insulation, construction and flooring, paints and coatings, lubricant and fuel additives, adhesives, agrochemicals, oilfield chemicals, printing inks, pigment dispersion
Ethyleneamines | Chemical building block used in lubricant and fuel additives, epoxy hardeners, wet strength resins, chelating agents, fungicides 
Ethanolamines | Wood preservatives, herbicides, construction products, gas treatment, metalworking, personal care 
Other specialty Amines, including DGA® Agent | Gas treating, ag chemicals, personal care, lubricant and fuel additives, polyurethane foams, fabric softeners, paints and coatings, refinery processing, water treating 


        Polyetheramines are produced by reacting polyol with ammonia. They provide sophisticated performance characteristics as an additive in the manufacture of highly customized epoxy formulations, enabling customers to penetrate new markets and substitute for traditional curing materials.

           Our ethyleneamines are manufactured by reacting EDC and caustic soda with ammonia to produce a range of various ethyleneamines homologues having different molecular weights. Most other producers utilize a reductive amination process, which yields a light slate of ethyleneamines. We believe our heavier slate of homologues allows access to a greater range of markets. 
         Ethanolamines are a range of chemicals produced by the reaction of EO with ammonia. There are a limited number of competitors due to the technical and cost barriers to entry. 
         Our amines are used in a wide variety of mainly industrial applications, including composites, paints and coatings, polyurethane foam, fuel and lubricant additives, and solvents. Our key amines customers include Proctor & Gamble, Chevron, Lubrizol, Air Products, Hexion, Afton, Infineum, Univar, Monsanto and PPG. 
  Maleic Anhydride (including catalyst and licensing).    Maleic anhydride is a highly versatile chemical intermediate that is used to produce UPRs, which are the main ingredient in fiberglass reinforced resins used for marine and automotive applications and commercial and residential construction products. Maleic anhydride is also used in the production of lubricants, food additives and artificial sweeteners. 

   
Product Group | Applications 
Maleic Anhydride | Boat hulls, automotive, construction, lubricant and fuel additives, countertops, agrochemicals, paper and food additives
Maleic Anhydride Catalyst and Technology Licensing | Maleic anhydride, BDO and its derivatives, and PBT manufacturers 


        Maleic anhydride is produced by oxidizing either benzene or normal butane through the use of a catalyst. Our maleic anhydride technology is a proprietary fixed bed butane process with solvent. We believe that our process is superior in the areas of feedstock, energy efficiency and solvent recovery. The maleic anhydride-based route to BDO manufacture is currently the preferred process technology and is favored over the other routes, which include PO, butadiene and acetylene as feedstocks. As a result, the growth in demand for BDO has resulted in increased demand for our maleic anhydride technology and catalyst. Generally, changes in price have resulted from a combination of changes in industry capacity utilization and underlying raw material costs. 
         We license our maleic anhydride technology and supply our catalysts to licensees and to worldwide merchant customers. Revenue from licensing and catalyst comes from new plant commissioning, as well as current plant retrofits and catalyst change schedules. Our licensing group also licenses technology on behalf of other Performance Products businesses and other segments. 
         Our key maleic anhydride customers include AOC, Reichhold, Tate & Lyle, Afton, CCP Composites, Cranston, Dixie, Gulf Chemical, Lubrizol and MFG Chemical. 
         Surfactants (including LAB).    Surfactants or "surface active agents" are substances that combine a water soluble component with a water insoluble component in the same molecule. While surfactants are most commonly used for their detergency in cleaning applications, they are also valued for their emulsification, foaming, dispersing, penetrating and wetting properties in a variety of industries. 
         We are a leading global manufacturer of nonionic, anionic, cationic and amphoteric surfactants products and are characterized by our breadth of product offering and market coverage. Following the 
 13

   sale of our European surfactants business to Innospec at the end of 2016, we now have certain products toll manufactured in Europe. 

   
Product Group | Applications 
Surfactants | Home and personal care, agricultural chemicals, construction, paper de-inking, lubricants
Specialty Alkylates | Precursors for lubricant additives 
LAB | Consumer detergents, industrial and institutional detergents 


        Demand growth for surfactants used in basic detergency applications is relatively stable and exhibits little cyclicality. However, many product applications for surfactants can demand new formulations with improved performance characteristics, which affords considerable opportunity for innovative surfactants manufacturers like us to provide surfactants and blends with differentiated specifications and properties. We continue to strengthen and diversify our surfactant product offering into formulated specialty surfactant products for use in various industrial applications such as leather and textile treatment, foundry and construction, agrochemicals, fuels and lubricants, personal care and polymers and coatings. 
         For basic surfactants, pricing tends to have a strong relationship to underlying raw material prices and usually lags raw material price movements. Surfactants used in more specialty applications are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer-specific end-use application. Our key surfactants customers include L'Oreal, Monsanto, Nufarm, Clorox, Henkel, Colgate, Procter & Gamble and Unilever. 
         LAB is a surfactant intermediate, which is produced through the reaction of benzene with either normal paraffins or linear alpha olefins. Nearly all the LAB produced globally is converted into LAS, a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer, industrial and institutional laundry detergents. We also manufacture a higher-molecular-weight alkylate, which is used as an additive to lubricants. Our key customers for LAB and specialty alkylates include Colgate, Lubrizol, Procter & Gamble and Unilever. 
  Upstream Intermediates.    We consume internally produced and third-party-sourced base petrochemicals in the manufacture of our surfactants, LAB, and ethanolamines products, which are primarily used in detergency, consumer products and industrial applications. We also produce EG, which is primarily used in the production of polyester fibers and PET packaging. 
         We consume our internally produced EO to produce three types of EG: MEG, DEG and TEG. MEG is consumed primarily in the polyester (fiber and bottle resin) and antifreeze end markets and is also used in a wide variety of industrial applications including synthetic lubricants, plasticizers, solvents and emulsifiers. DEG is consumed internally for the production of Morpholine and DGA® Agent and polyols. TEG is used internally for the production of polyols and is sold into the market for dehydration of natural gas. We continue to optimize our EO and EG operations depending on the fundamental market demand for EG. 

   
Product Group | Applications 
EG | Polyester fibers and PET bottle resins, heat transfer and hydraulic fluids, chemical intermediates, natural gas and hydrocarbon treating agents, unsaturated polyester resins, polyester polyols, plasticizers, solvent

The Port Neches, Texas facility benefits from extensive logistics infrastructure, which allows for efficient sourcing of other raw materials and distribution of finished products. 
         A number of our facilities are located within large integrated petrochemical manufacturing complexes. We believe this results in greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would be able to obtain if these facilities were stand-alone operations. These include our LAB facility in Chocolate Bayou, Texas; our maleic anhydride facilities in Pensacola, Florida, Geismar, Louisiana and Moers, Germany and our ethyleneamines facility in Freeport, Texas. 
   Joint Ventures 
  Ethyleneamines Joint Venture.    Since July 1, 2010, we have consolidated the results of AAC, our 50%-owned joint venture with the Zamil Group. AAC operates an ethyleneamines manufacturing plant in Jubail, Saudi Arabia. The plant has an approximate annual capacity of 60 million pounds. We purchase and sell all of the production from this joint venture. 
         Maleic Anhydride Joint Venture.    Since the second quarter of 2011, we have consolidated the results of Sasol-Huntsman, our 50%-owned maleic anhydride joint venture. This entity operates a manufacturing facility in Moers, Germany with the capacity to produce 232 million pounds of maleic anhydride. The output from the facility is sold in the European region.

All of the ethylene is used to produce EO and all of the propylene is used to produce PO at our Port Neches, Texas facility (primarily for our Polyurethanes segment). We have the capacity to use approximately 1,000 million pounds of ethylene each year in the production of EO and ethyleneamines. Accordingly, we purchase or toll the remainder of our ethylene requirements from third parties. We consume all of our EO in the manufacture of our EG, surfactants, carbonates and amines products. We also use internally produced PO and DEG in the manufacture of these products. 
         In addition to internally produced raw materials, the main raw materials used in the production of our amines are EDC, caustic soda, ammonia, hydrogen, methylamines and acrylonitrile. The majority of these raw materials are available from multiple sources in the merchant market at competitive prices. 
         Maleic anhydride is produced by the reaction of normal butane with oxygen using our proprietary catalyst. The principal raw material is normal butane, which is purchased pursuant to long-term contracts and delivered to our Pensacola, Florida site by barge, to our facility in Geismar, Louisiana via pipeline and to our Moers, Germany site by railcar. Our maleic anhydride catalyst is toll-manufactured by a third party under a long-term contract according to our proprietary methods. These raw materials are available from multiple sources at competitive prices. 
         In the production of surfactants and LAB, our primary raw materials, in addition to internally produced and third-party sourced EO and ethylene, are synthetic and natural alcohols, paraffin, alpha olefins, benzene and nonylphenol. All of these raw materials are widely available in the merchant market at competitive prices.

  Raw Materials 
         The principal raw materials we purchase for the manufacture of basic and advanced epoxy resins are epichlorohydrin, bisphenol A, MDA, phenol and aminophenols. We also purchase amines, polyols, isocyanates, acrylic materials, hardeners and fillers for the production of our formulated polymer systems and complex chemicals and additives. Raw material costs constitute a sizeable percentage of the costs for certain applications. We have supply contracts with a number of suppliers. The terms of our supply contracts vary, but, in general, these contracts contain provisions that set forth the quantities of product to be supplied and purchased. Formula pricing is sometimes used if advantageous for the business. 
         Additionally, we produce large volumes of some of our most important raw materials, such as BLR and its basic derivatives, which are the basic building blocks of many of our products. Approximately 63% of the BLR we produce is consumed internally in our downstream products. The balance of our BLR is sold in the merchant market, allowing us to increase the utilization of our production plants and lower our overall BLR production cost. We believe that manufacturing a large proportion of our own BLR gives us a competitive advantage over other epoxy-based polymer systems formulators, who buy BLR from third-party suppliers. This position helps protect us from pricing pressure from BLR suppliers and aids in providing us a stable supply of BLR in difficult market conditions. 
         We consume certain amines produced by our Performance Products segment and isocyanates produced by our Polyurethanes segment, which we use to formulate Advanced Materials products.

     Sales and Marketing 
         During 2016, approximately 75% of our sales were generated with approximately 2,050 direct customers through our global sales and technical services network and the remaining 25% is generated through our distribution partners. Our sales and technical services representatives work directly with our existing customers forming strong relationships and uncovering new opportunities. 
         In determining the markets on which we focus, we look at growth opportunity and value proposition. Consumption markets are primarily in developed economies such as Europe and North America, while production markets are primarily in Asia like China, India, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Turkey and Bangladesh. Our downstream marketing team engages with leading brands and retailers in developed economies while our sales force and manufacturing footprint are primarily in Asia, closer to the manufacturing and sourcing base for textiles. We believe that this set-up also enables us to take advantage of continuous demand growth due to demographic and lifestyle changes in emerging markets. 
         For our textile effects products, we focus on providing effect competence and process competence to our customers. Effect competence, which we define as delivering value-added effects to our customers' products, enables us to capitalize on new and innovative technologies and to assist our customers in their efforts to differentiate themselves from competitors. Process competence, which we define as applying know-how and expertise to improve customers' processes, allows us to utilize our technical service to reduce cost, enhance efficiency and offer recommendations to improve the ecological and environmental footprint in the wet processing of textiles. 
         We maintain strong customer relationships through the delivery of high levels of technical service and product innovation. There are 14 technical services laboratories in North America, South America, Europe and Asia that are close to our customers in these markets, which enables us to serve our customers with greater speed and flexibility. 
   Manufacturing and Operations 
         We are a global business serving customers in three principal geographic regions: EAME, the Americas and Asia. To service our customers efficiently, we maintain manufacturing plants around the world with a strategy of global, regional and local manufacturing employed to optimize the level of

95%-owned and consolidated manufacturing joint venture with Guangzhou Sheng'an Package Company Limited. 
(3)
Chemical Formulations operations were transferred to Huntsman Pursan Chemicals, a majority-owned joint venture, in 2016. 


  Joint Venture 
         In September 2015, the Textile Effects segment established a joint venture agreement with Huntsman Pursan Chemicals, a 60%-owned consolidated joint venture, for the manufacture, formulation and sale of textile chemicals and dyes in Turkey. The joint venture extends the long-term partnership between the two companies to a strategic level of collaboration and strengthens Textile Effects' competitive position in the Turkish textile sector. 
 Raw Materials 
         The manufacture of textile effects products requires a wide selection of raw materials (approximately 1,000 different chemicals), including amines, ethoxylates, acrylics and sulfones. No one raw material represents greater than 5% of our textile effects raw material expenditures. Raw material costs constitute a sizeable percentage of sales for certain applications. We have tolling arrangements with several Chinese suppliers, but the majority of our raw materials are not purchased under long-term contracts. The terms of our supply contracts vary, but, in general, these contracts contain provisions that set forth the quantities of product to be supplied and purchased. 
 Competition 
         We are a major global solutions provider for textile chemicals, dyes and digital inks in our chosen markets. Competition within the textile chemicals and dyes markets is generally fragmented with few competitors who can offer complete solutions for the entire textile markets. Our major competitors that compete in both textile chemicals and dyes are Archroma (businesses formerly owned by Clariant and BASF) and Dystar (owned by Kiri-Longsheng). Key competitors within dyes include Longsheng, Runtu, Jihua and Dystar. For textile chemicals, key competitors include Archroma, Transfar/Tannatex and CHT, while key competition in Digital Inks includes Kiian/Jteck/Sawgrass, Sensient/Xennia and DuPont. 
 24

          
        We believe that our competitive strengths include our product offering, which is characterized by its broad and deep technology range, high quality, significant integration between products and service, reliable technical expertise, long-standing relationships with customers, and strong business infrastructure in Asia. We are a leader in environmentally sustainable chemistry with products that help customers enhance efficiency and reduce their environmental footprint. We believe that we have more customer service capability and account management capability than any of our competitors worldwide. In addition, we engage regularly with downstream brands and retailers on industry and sustainability issues. 
   Pigments and Additives 
         Our Pigments and Additives segment manufactures titanium dioxide, functional additives, color pigments, timber treatment and water treatment products. Our broad product range, coupled with our ability to develop and supply specialized products into technically exacting end-use applications, has positioned us as a leader in the markets we serve. In 2014, we acquired the Performance Additives and Titanium Dioxide businesses ("Rockwood Acquisition") of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. ("Rockwood"), broadening our specialty titanium dioxide product offerings and adding significant scale and capacity to our titanium dioxide facilities. The Rockwood Acquisition positioned us as a leader in the specialty and differentiated titanium dioxide industry segments, which includes products that sell at a premium and have more stable margins. The Rockwood Acquisition also provided us with complementary functional additives, color pigments, timber treatment and water treatment businesses. 
         Our Pigments and Additives segment has 27 manufacturing facilities operating in 10 countries with a total production capacity of approximately 1.3 million metric tons per year. We operate eight titanium dioxide manufacturing facilities in Europe, North America and Asia and 19 color pigments, functional additives, water treatment and timber treatment manufacturing and processing facilities in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. 
         We have substantially transformed our Pigments and Additives segment in recent years and have firmly established ourselves as a market leader in the industries in which we operate. Our Pigments and Additives segment spent $1.3 billion from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016 on acquisitions, restructuring and integration. We have recently identified plans for additional business improvements in our Pigments and Additives segment, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2018 and deliver additional adjusted EBITDA to our business. As a result of these efforts, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on market recovery and growth opportunities, and maximize profitability as demand and prices increase. 
         On October 28, 2016, we filed an initial Form 10 registration statement with the SEC as part of the process to spin off our Pigments and Additives and Textile Effects businesses in a tax-free transaction. On January 17, 2017, we announced that we will retain our Textile Effects business and we amended the Form 10 registration statement. We also announced that the name of the spin-off entity will be Venator. Venator shares are expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker VNTR after the distribution to our stockholders. The completion of the spin-off is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the registration statement on Form 10 for Venator's common stock being declared effective by the SEC and certain other conditions described in the information statement included in the Form 10. The ongoing process to separate the Pigments and Additives business is proceeding and is targeted for the second quarter 2017. As noted in "Recent Developments" above, there was fire damage sustained at our titanium dioxide facility in Pori, Finland. The potential impact of this interruption, if any, on the spin date is not yet known.

     Products and Markets 
  Titanium Dioxide.    Titanium dioxide is derived from titanium bearing ores and is a white inert pigment that provides whiteness, opacity and brightness to thousands of everyday items, including coatings, plastics, paper, printing inks, fibers, food and personal care products. We are one of the six major producers of titanium dioxide that collectively account for approximately 60% of global TiO2 production capacity according to TZ Mineral International Pty Ltd. ("TZMI"), an independent consulting company that reports market data for the chemicals sector. Producers of the remaining 40% are primarily single-plant producers that focus on regional sales. We are among the three largest global titanium dioxide producers, with nameplate production capacity of approximately 782,000 metric tons per year, accounting for approximately 11% of global titanium dioxide production capacity. We are able to manufacture a broad range of titanium dioxide products from functional to specialty. Our specialty products sell at a premium into specialized applications such as fibers, catalysts, food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. By operating both sulfate and chloride processes, we also have the ability to use a wide range of titanium feedstocks, which enhances the competitiveness of our manufacturing operations, by providing flexibility in the selection of raw materials. This helps insulate us from price fluctuations for any particular feedstock and allows us to reduce our raw material costs. 
         Global TiO2 demand growth rates tend to track GDP growth rates over the medium term; however, this varies by region. Developed markets such as the U.S. and Western Europe exhibit higher consumption per person but lower demand growth rates, while emerging markets such as Asia exhibit much higher demand growth rates. The TiO2 industry experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting the high exposure to seasonal coatings end-use markets. Coating sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year. 
         We own a portfolio of brands including TIOXIDE®, HOMBITAN®, HOMBITEC®, UVTITAN® and ALTIRIS® used in connection with materials, which are produced in our eight manufacturing facilities around the globe. We service over 2,300 customers in most major industries and geographic regions. Our global manufacturing footprint allows us to service the needs of both local and global customers, including A. Schulman, AkzoNobel, Ampacet, BASF, Clariant, DSM, Flint, PPG, PolyOne, Sherwin-Williams and Sun Chemical. 
         There are two manufacturing processes for the production of titanium dioxide, the sulfate process and the chloride process. We believe that the chloride process accounts for approximately 45% of global production capacity. Our production capabilities are distinguished from some of our competitors because of our ability to manufacture titanium dioxide using both sulfate and chloride manufacturing processes, which gives us the flexibility to tailor our products to meet our customers' needs. Most end-use applications can use pigments produced by either process, although there are markets that prefer pigment from a specific manufacturing routefor example, the inks market prefers sulfate products and the automotive coatings market prefers chloride products. Regional customers typically favor products that are available locally. The sulfate process produces titanium dioxide in both the rutile and anatase forms, the latter being used in certain high-value specialty applications. 
         Once an intermediate titanium dioxide pigment has been produced using either the chloride or sulfate process, it is "finished" into a product with specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications. Co-products from both processes require treatment prior to disposal in order to comply with environmental regulations. In order to reduce our disposal costs and to increase our cost competitiveness, we have developed and marketed the co-products of our titanium dioxide manufacturing. We sell approximately 60% of the co-products generated by our business. 
         We have an established broad customer base and have successfully differentiated ourselves by establishing ourselves as a market leader in a variety of niche market segments where the innovation 
 26

   and specialization of our products is rewarded with higher growth prospects and strong customer relationships. 

   
Product Type | Rutile titanium dioxide | Anatase titanium dioxide | Nano titanium dioxide 
Characteristics | Most common crystal form of titanium dioxide; harder and more durable | Softer, less abrasive pigment, preferred for some specialty applications | Ultra-fine titanium dioxide and other titanium dioxide specialties

 Color Pigments.    We are a leading global producer of colored inorganic pigments for the construction, coating, plastics and specialty markets. We are one of three global leaders in the manufacture and processing of liquid, powder and granulated forms of iron oxide color pigments. We also sell natural and synthetic inorganic pigments and metal carboxylate driers. The cost effectiveness, weather resistance, chemical and thermal stability and coloring strength of iron oxide make it an ideal colorant for construction materials, such as concrete, brick and roof tile, and for coatings and plastics. We produce a wide range of color pigments and are the world's second largest manufacturer of technical grade ultramarine blue pigments, which have a unique blue shade and are widely used to correct colors, giving them a desirable clean, blue undertone. These attributes have resulted in ultramarine blue being used world-wide for polymeric applications such as construction plastics, food packaging, automotive polymers, consumer plastics, coatings and cosmetics. 
         Our products are sold under a portfolio of brands used in connection with items that are targeted to the construction sector such as DAVIS COLORS, GRANUFIN and FERROXIDE and the following brands HOLLIDAY PIGMENTS, COPPERAS RED® and MAPICO used for products focused predominantly on the coatings and plastics sectors. 
         Our products are also used by manufacturers of colorants, rubber, paper, cosmetics, pet food, digital ink, toner and other industrial uses delivering benefits in other applications such as corrosion protection and catalysis.

        Iron oxide pigment's cost effectiveness, weather resistance, chemical and thermal stability and coloring strength make it an ideal colorant for construction materials, such as concrete, brick and roof tile, and for coatings such as paints and plastics. We are one of the three largest synthetic inorganic color pigments producers which together represent more than 50% of the global market for iron oxide pigments. The remaining market share consists primarily of Chinese competitors. 
         Made from clay, our ultramarine blue pigments are non-toxic, weather resistant and thermally stable. Ultramarine blue is used world-wide for food contact applications. Our synthetic ultramarines are permitted for unrestricted use in certain cosmetics applications. Ultramarine blue is used extensively in plastics and the paint industry. We focus on supplying our customers with technical grade ultramarine blues and violets to high specification markets such as the cosmetics industry. 
         We are now commissioning a new production facility in Augusta, Georgia for the synthesis of iron oxide pigments, which we purchased from Rockwood. During commissioning, the facility has experienced delays producing products at the expected specifications and quantities, causing us to question the capabilities of the Augusta technology. Based on the facility's performance during the commissioning process, we have concluded that production capacity at our Augusta facility will be substantially lower than originally anticipated. On February 6, 2017, we filed a lawsuit against Rockwood, Albemarle Corporation (as Rockwood's successor) and certain former Rockwood executives to recover damage for fraud and breach of contract involving the Augusta technology. 
  Timber Treatment and Water Treatment.    We manufacture wood protection chemicals used primarily in residential and commercial applications to prolong the service life of wood through protection from decay and fungal or insect attack. Wood that has been treated with our products is sold to consumers through major branded retail outlets such as Lowe's. 
         We manufacture our timber treatment chemicals in the U.S. and market our products primarily in North America through Viance, LLC ("Viance"), our 50%-owned joint venture with Dow Chemical formed in 2007. Our residential construction products such as ACQ, ECOLIFE® and Copper Azole are sold for use in decking, fencing and other residential outdoor wood structures. Our industrial construction products such as Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) are sold for use in telephone poles and salt water piers and pilings. 
         We manufacture our water treatment chemicals in Germany, and these products are used to improve water purity in industrial, commercial and municipal applications. We are one of Europe's largest suppliers of polyaluminium chloride (PAC) based flocculants with approximately 140,000 metric 
 28

   tons of production capacity. Our main markets are municipal and industrial waste water treatment and the paper industry. 
   Sales and Marketing 
         We serve over 9,000 customers through our Pigments and Additives segment. These customers produce paints and coatings, plastics, paper, printing inks, fibers and films, pharmaceuticals, food, cosmetics, materials for the construction industry, catalyst applications and protect wood and treat water with our chemicals. Approximately 85% of our Pigments and Additives sales are made directly to customers through our own global sales and technical services network. This network enables us to work directly with our customers and develop a deep understanding of our customers' needs and to develop valuable relationships. The remaining 15% of sales are made through our distribution network. We maximize the reach our distribution network by utilizing specialty distributors in selected markets. 
         Larger customers are typically served via our own sales network and these customers often have annual volume targets with associated pricing mechanisms. Smaller customers are served through a combination of our global sales teams and a distribution network, and the route to market decision is often dependent upon customer size and end application. 
         We sell iron oxides primarily through our global sales force whereas our ultramarine sales are predominantly through specialty distributors. We sell the majority of our timber treatment products directly to end customers via our joint venture Viance. 
         Our focus is on marketing products and services to higher growth and higher value applications. For example, we believe that our Pigments and Additives segment is well-positioned to benefit from growth sectors, such as fibers and films, catalysts, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food, where customers' needs are complex resulting in fewer companies that have the capability to support them. We maximize reach through specialty distributors in selected markets. Our focused sales effort, technical expertise, strong customer service and local manufacturing presence have allowed us to achieve leading market positions in a number of the countries where we manufacture our products. 
   Manufacturing and Operations 
         As of December 31, 2016, our Pigments and Additives segment has 27 manufacturing facilities operating in 10 countries with a total production capacity of approximately 1.3 million metric tons per year.

This facility is owned and operated by LPC, a manufacturing joint venture that is owned 50% by us and 50% by Kronos. The capacity shown reflects our 50% interest in LPC. 


  Joint Ventures 
  U.S. Titanium Dioxide Joint Venture.    LPC is our 50%-owned unconsolidated joint venture with Kronos. We share production offtake and operating costs of the plant with Kronos, though we market our share of the production independently. The operations of the joint venture are under the direction of a supervisory committee on which each partner has equal representation. Our investment in LPC is accounted for using the equity method. 
  U.S. Timber Treatment Joint Venture.    Viance is our 50%-owned joint venture with Dow Chemical. Viance markets our timber treatment products. Our joint venture interest in Viance was acquired as part of the Rockwood Acquisition on October 1, 2014. The joint venture sources all of its products through a contract manufacturing arrangement at our Harrisburg, North Carolina facility, and we bear a disproportionate amount of working capital risk of loss due to the supply arrangement whereby we control manufacturing on Viance's behalf. As a result, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and began consolidating Viance upon the Rockwood Acquisition on October 1, 2014. 
 Raw Materials 
         The primary raw materials used in our Pigments and Additives segment are as follows: 

   
 | Titanium Dioxide | Functional Additives | Color Pigments | Timber Treatment | Water Chemicals
Primary raw materials | Titanium bearing ore, sulfuric acid, chlorine | Barium and zinc based inorganics | Iron oxide particles, scrap iron, copperas alkali | DCOIT, copper, monoethanolamine | Aluminum oxide 


        The primary raw materials that are used to produce titanium dioxide are various types of titanium feedstock, which include ilmenite, rutile, titanium slag (chloride slag and sulfate slag) and synthetic rutile. According to TZMI, the world market for titanium-bearing ores has a diverse range of suppliers with the four largest accounting for approximately 40% of global supply. The majority of our titanium-bearing ores are sourced from India, Africa, Canada and Norway. Ore accounts for approximately 45% 
 30

   of titanium dioxide variable manufacturing costs, while utilities (electricity, gas and steam), sulfuric acid and chlorine collectively account for approximately 30% of variable manufacturing costs. 
         The majority of the titanium-bearing ores market is transacted on short-term contracts, or longer-term volume contracts with market-based pricing re-negotiated several times per year. This form of market-based ore contract provides flexibility and responsiveness in terms of pricing and quantity obligations. 
         The primary raw materials for functional additives production are barite and zinc. We currently source material barite from China, where we have long standing supplier relationships and pricing is negotiated largely on a purchase by purchase basis. The quality of zinc required for our business is mainly mined in Australia but can also be sourced from Canada and South America. The majority of our zinc is sourced from two key suppliers with whom we have long standing relationships. 
         We source our raw material for the majority of our color pigments business from China, the U.S., France and Italy. Key raw materials are iron powder and metal scrap that are sourced from various mid-size and smaller producers primarily on a spot contract basis. 
         The primary raw materials for our timber treatment business are dichloro-octylisothiazolinone ("DCOIT") and copper. We source the raw materials for the majority of our timber treatment business from China and the U.S. DCOIT is sourced on a long term contract whereas copper is procured from various mid-size and larger producers primarily on a spot contract basis. 
         The primary raw materials for our water treatment business are aluminum hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, which are widely available from a number of sources and typically sourced through long term contracts. We also use sulfuric acid which we source internally. 
   Competition 
         The global markets in which our Pigments and Additives segment operates are highly competitive and vary according to product. 
         Competition within the standard grade titanium dioxide market is based on price, product quality and service. Our key competitors are Chemours, Tronox, Kronos and Cristal, each of which is a major global producer with the ability to service all global markets and Billions, a Chinese titanium dioxide producer. If any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. Moreover, the sulfate based titanium dioxide technology used by our Pigments and Additives segment is widely available. Accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing. 
         Competition within the specialty titanium dioxide market and the color pigments market is based on customer service, technical expertise in the customers' applications, product attributes (such as product form and quality) and price. Product quality is particularly critical in the technically demanding applications in which we focus as inconsistent product quality adversely impacts consistency in the end-product. Our primary competitors within specialty titanium dioxide include Fuji Titanium Industry, Kronos and Precheza. Our primary competitors within color pigments include Lanxess AG, Cathay Pigments Group, Ferro Corporation and Shanghai Yipin Pigments Co., Ltd. 
         Competition within the functional additives market is primarily based on application know-how, brand recognition, product quality and price. Key competitors for barium-based additives include Solvay S.A., Sakai Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., 20 Microns Ltd. and Chinese barium producers. Key competitors for zinc-based additives include Chinese lithopone producers. 
 31

           Competition within the timber treatment market is based on price, customer support services, innovative technology and product range. Our primary competitors are Lonza Group and Koppers. Competition within the water treatment market is based on proximity to customers and price. Our primary competitors are Kemira and Feralco.

We own approximately 3,015 unexpired global patents and have approximately 1,370 patent applications (including provisionals) currently pending. While a presumption of validity exists with respect to issued U.S. patents, we cannot assure that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Furthermore, we cannot assure the issuance of any pending patent application, or that if patents do issue, that these patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. Additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner. 
         We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that confidentiality and other agreements into which we enter and have entered will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. 
         In addition to our own patents and patent applications and proprietary trade secrets and know-how, we are a party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing us to use trade secrets, know-how and related technology and/or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities. We also have licensed or sub-licensed intellectual property rights to third parties. 
         We have associated brand names with a number of our products, and we have approximately 4,080 global trademark registrations and 235 pending registrations. Some of these registrations and applications include filings under the Madrid system for the international registration of marks and may confer rights in multiple countries. However, there can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will provide meaningful protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors, or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted. 
         Because of the breadth and nature of our intellectual property rights and our business, we do not believe that any single intellectual property right (other than certain trademarks for which we intend to 
 32

   maintain the applicable registrations) is material to our business. Moreover, we do not believe that the termination of intellectual property rights expected to occur over the next several years, either individually or in the aggregate, will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
   EMPLOYEES 
         As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 15,000 associates in our operations around the world. Approximately 3,000 of these employees are located in the U.S., while approximately 12,000 are located in other countries. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 
GEOGRAPHIC DATA 
         For sales revenue and long-lived assets by geographic areas, see "Note 26. Operating Segment Information" to our consolidated financial statements. 
   ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS 
   General 
         We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, pollution, protection of the environment, product management and distribution, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation. Actual or alleged violations of safety laws, environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some environmental laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations. Accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities. Information related to environmental, health and safety ("EHS") matters may also be found in other areas of this report including "Item 1A. Risk Factors," "Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesEnvironmental Expenditures" to our consolidated financial statements and "Note 21. Environmental Health and Safety Matters" to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Environmental, Health and Safety Systems 
         We are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable EHS legal requirements, and we have developed policies and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of EHS legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements, improve the safety of our employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants. Although EHS legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with, these EHS management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and reducing overall risk to us. 
 Environmental Remediation 
         We have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials. Similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that 
 33

   was disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses. Under some circumstances, the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources. 
         In cases where our potential liability arises from historical contamination based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of a business or specific facility, we frequently obtain an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre-closing conditions. We have successfully exercised our rights under these contractual covenants for a number of sites and, where applicable, mitigated our ultimate remediation liability. We cannot assure you, however, that the liabilities for all such matters subject to indemnity will be honored by the prior owner or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters. 
         Based on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material effect on our financial statements. However, if such indemnities are not honored or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to such costs, then such expenditures may have a material effect on our financial statements. At the current time, we are unable to estimate the total cost, exclusive of indemnification benefits, to remediate contamination sites. 
   Regulatory Matters 
   Greenhouse Gas Regulation and Climate Change 
         Globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHGs"), such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth's climate. At the Durban negotiations of the Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in 2012, a limited group of nations, including the European Union (the "EU"), agreed to a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in GHG emissions. More significantly, the EU GHG Emissions Trading System ("ETS"), established pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol to reduce GHG emissions in the EU, continues in its third phase. The EU parliament has used a process to formalize "backloading"the withholding of GHG allowances during the trading period from 2014 to 2016 with additional allowances auctioned during 2019 to 2020to prop up carbon prices. As backloading is only a temporary measure, a sustainable solution to the imbalance between supply and demand requires structural changes to the ETS. The European Commission proposes to establish a market stability reserve to address the current surplus of allowances and improve the system's resilience. The reserve will start operating in 2019. In addition, the EU has announced the binding target to reduce domestic GHG emissions by at least 40% below the 1990 level by 2030. The European Commission proposed an objective of increasing the share of renewable energy to at least 27% of the EU's energy consumption by 2030. The European Council endorsed this target, which is binding at the EU level. The European Commission also proposed a 30% energy savings target for 2030. The European Council, however, endorsed an indicative target of 27% to be reviewed in 2020 having in mind a 30% target. 
         In addition, at the 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, the U.S. and nearly 200 other nations entered into an international climate agreement, which entered into effect in November 2016. Although the agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. The U.S. is one of over 100 nations that have indicated an intent to comply with the agreement. 
         Federal climate change legislation in the U.S. appears unlikely in the near-term. As a result, domestic efforts to curb GHG emissions will continue to be led by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (the "EPA") GHG regulations and the efforts of states. To the extent that our domestic operations are subject to the EPA's GHG regulations, we may face increased capital and operating costs associated with new or expanded facilities. Significant expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the Clean Air Act's (the "CAA") requirements for 
 34

   pollutants regulated under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs. Some of our facilities are also subject to the EPA's Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule, and any further regulation may increase our operational costs. In addition, under a consent decree with states and environmental groups, the EPA is due to propose new source performance standards for GHG emissions from refineries. These standards could significantly increase the costs of constructing or adding capacity to refineries and may ultimately increase the costs or decrease the supply of refined products. Either of these events could have an adverse effect on our business. 
         We are already managing and reporting GHG emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to U.S. federal and state requirements, Kyoto Protocol obligations and/or ETS requirements. Although these sites are subject to existing GHG legislation, few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs, although it is possible that GHG emission restrictions may increase over time. Potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet GHG emission restrictions and/or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. Currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites. 
         Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations

      ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
   RISKS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED SPIN-OFF 
   The proposed spin-off of our Pigments and Additives businesses is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, may require significant time and attention of our management and may have an adverse effect on us if not completed. 
         On October 28, 2016, we announced plans to spin off our Pigments and Additives business into a separate, publicly traded company, Venator. Completion of the proposed spin-off is subject to various conditions and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions that could delay, prevent, or otherwise adversely affect the spin-off. Completion of the spin-off will be contingent upon several factors, including, but not limited to, authorization and approval of our Board of Directors, receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS, receipt of a tax opinion regarding the 
 36

   tax-free status of the spin-off, completion of new financing arrangements, execution of ancillary agreements, and the effectiveness of a registration statement with the SEC. There can be no assurance that the spin-off will be completed as expected, if at all. 
         In pursuing the proposed spin-off, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected, and we may be subject to certain risks and consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:
 

 execution of the proposed spin-off will require significant time and attention from management, which may postpone the execution of other
initiatives that may have been beneficial to us; 
 completion of the spin-off will require strategic, structural and process realignment and restructuring actions within our operations, which
could lead to a disruption of our operations and loss of, or inability to recruit key personnel needed to operate and grow our businesses and to complete the proposed spin-off; 
 completion of the spin-off may require certain management and procedural redundancies as we prepare for the spin-off, which may result in
operating inefficiencies; and 
 we will be required to pay certain costs and expenses relating to the spin-off, such as legal, accounting, and other professional fees, whether
or not it is completed. 

         We may also experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the spin-off. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock. 
   We may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits from the proposed spin-off. 
         We may not achieve some or all of the financial, operational, managerial, and other anticipated benefits from the proposed spin-off, or the spin-off may not provide such benefits on the scale we anticipate for a variety of reasons. In addition, we will incur one-time costs in connection with the spin-off that may negate some of the benefits we expect to achieve. 
   If the proposed spin-off of our Pigments and Additives business is completed, the trading price of our common stock will likely decline. 
         We expect the trading price of our common stock immediately following the proposed spin-off to be lower than immediately preceding the spin-off, as the trading price of our common stock will no longer reflect the value of our Pigments and Additives business. In addition, we can not assure you that that the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies following the completion of the spin-off, as adjusted for any changes in the combined capitalization of these companies, will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed spin-off not occurred. Until the market has fully evaluated the business of our Company without its Pigments and Additives segment, the price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly. Similarly, until the market has fully evaluated Venator, the price at which Venator's common stock trades may fluctuate significantly. 
   The proposed spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. 
         The proposed spin-off is intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355, 361 and/or 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). We are seeking, and completion of the spin-off is conditioned upon the receipt of, a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to the effect that our retention of Venator Class A common stock will not be in pursuance of a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of federal income tax, that certain post-spin-off exchanges of such Venator stock for our Company's indebtedness will be treated as tax-free under Section 355 and 361 of the Code and that certain payments or 
 37

   transfers of assets and liabilities that may occur following the spin-off will be treated as part of the spin-off transaction (the "IRS Ruling"). If the IRS Ruling is received, our tax counsel is expected to issue an opinion that our pro rata distribution of all outstanding Venator Class B common stock to our stockholders qualifies as a tax-free transaction under Sections 355, 361 and/or 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and that certain elements of the restructuring transactions undertaken as part of the spin-off will also qualify for tax-free treatment under Sections 355, 361 and/or 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code (the "Tax Opinion"). 
         The tax-free treatment of the spin-off will be contingent on the continued validity of the IRS Ruling and the Tax Opinion, both of which will be based on certain facts, representations and undertakings. If any of such facts, representations or undertakings are not correct, are incomplete, or are violated, the IRS Ruling could be revoked or modified by the IRS and our Company's ability to rely on the Tax Opinion could be jeopardized. If the spin-off distribution, and/or related internal transactions, were determined to be taxable, Huntsman or Venator could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, if the spin-off were deemed to be taxable, each holder of Huntsman common stock who received shares of Venator would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of Venator received. 
         Even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment, the distribution may result in a corporate-level taxable gain to our Company if 50 percent or more, by vote or value, of Huntsman or Venator common stock, is treated as acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution. In that event, while our Company would recognize a taxable gain as described above, the distribution would be tax-free to our common stockholders. 
   RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 
   Our industry is affected by global economic factors including risks associated with volatile economic conditions. 
         Our financial results are substantially dependent on overall economic conditions in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Declining economic conditions in all or any of these locationsor negative perceptions about economic conditionscould result in a substantial decrease in demand for our products and could adversely affect our business. The timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain, and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time. For example, our operations in Asia have been impacted by slower growth in China, which continues to adversely affect demand for some of our products. Uncertain economic conditions and market instability make it particularly difficult for us to forecast demand trends. As a consequence, we may not be able to accurately predict future economic conditions or the effect of such conditions on our financial condition or results of operations. We can give no assurances as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future economic cycles impacting the industries in which we operate. 
   The markets for many of our products are cyclical and volatile, and we may experience depressed market conditions for such products. 
         The cyclicality that the markets for many of our products experience occurs as a result of alternating periods of tight supply, causing prices and margins to increase, followed by periods of lower capacity utilization, resulting in oversupply and declining prices and margins. The volatility these markets experience occurs as a result of changes in the demand for products as a consequence of global economic activity, changes in energy prices and changes in customers' requirements. For example, demand for our products depends in part on the housing and construction industries, which are cyclical in nature and have historically been impacted by downturns in the economy. In addition, margins for MTBE sales are volatile and seasonal. The supply-demand balance is also impacted by capacity additions or reductions that result in changes in utilization rates. The cyclicality and volatility 
 38

   of our industry results in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over the business cycle. 
         Primarily as a result of oversupply in the market, global prices for titanium dioxide declined throughout 2015 before reaching a trough in the first quarter of 2016. Although this market has experienced recent success in implementing price increases and increasing margins, there can be no assurances that the market will recover fully to historically normalized levels. Furthermore, the market could deteriorate to conditions worse than the trough experienced in the first quarter of 2016. If selling prices and margins do not recover fully to historically normalized levels or worsen, our results of operations and/or financial condition could be negatively impacted. 
   Disruptions in production at our manufacturing facilities may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. 
         Manufacturing facilities in our industry are subject to planned and unplanned production shutdowns, turnarounds, outages and other disruptions. Any serious disruption at any of our facilities could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to increase production or qualify with our customers, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Long-term production disruptions may cause our customers to seek alternative supply which could further adversely affect our profitability. 
         Unplanned production disruptions may occur for external reasons including natural disasters, weather, disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political unrest or terrorism, or internal reasons, such as fire, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems. Any such production disruption could have a material impact on our operations, operating results and financial condition. 
         In addition, we rely on a number of vendors, suppliers, and in some cases sole-source suppliers, service providers, toll manufacturers and collaborations with other industry participants to provide us with chemicals, feedstocks and other raw materials, along with energy sources and, in certain cases, facilities that we need to operate our business. If the business of these third parties is disrupted, some of these companies could be forced to reduce their output, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection. If this were to occur, it could adversely affect their ability to provide us with the raw materials, energy sources or facilities that we need, which could materially disrupt our operations, including the production of certain of our products. Moreover, it could be difficult to find replacements for certain of our business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases. All of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
         While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that could disrupt our business, we cannot provide assurances that our plans would fully protect us from the effects of all such disasters or from events that might increase in frequency or intensity due to climate change. In addition, insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters. In areas prone to frequent natural or other disasters, insurance may become increasingly expensive or not available at all. Furthermore, some potential climate-driven losses, particularly inundation due to sea-level rise, may pose long-term risks to our physical facilities such that operations cannot be restored in their current locations. 
 39

     Our results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, legal restrictions and taxes. 
         We conduct a majority of our business operations outside the U.S., and these operations are subject to risks normally associated with international operations. These risks include the need to convert currencies that may be received for our products into currencies in which we purchase raw materials or pay for services, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. We transact business in many foreign currencies, including euros, Swiss francs, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupees, Brazilian reals and Thai bahts. We translate our local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported international sales and earnings may be reduced because the local currency may translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Because we currently have significant operations located outside the U.S., we are exposed to fluctuations in global currency rates which may result in gains or losses on our financial statements. 
         Other risks of international operations include trade barriers, tariffs, exchange controls, cash repatriation restrictions, national and regional labor strikes, social and political risks, general economic risks and required compliance with a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, including monetary policies, tax laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (and foreign equivalents), export controls and regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Any changes in tariffs or trade barriers could make our products less competitive compared to other producers not subject to the same tariffs or trade barriers. Any decision to repatriate cash as dividends could subject us to foreign and U.S. federal and state income taxes without any offsetting foreign tax credit relief. Although we maintain an anti-corruption compliance program throughout our Company, violations of our compliance program may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, in foreign jurisdictions where legal processes may vary from country to country, we may experience difficulty in enforcing agreements. In jurisdictions where bankruptcy laws and practices vary, we may experience difficulty collecting foreign receivables through foreign legal systems. The occurrence of these risks, among others, could disrupt the businesses of our international subsidiaries, which could significantly affect their ability to make distributions to us. 
         We operate in a significant number of jurisdictions, which contributes to the volatility of our effective tax rate. Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our effective tax rate. In addition, generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP" or "U.S. GAAP") have required us to place valuation allowances against our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in a significant number of tax jurisdictions. These valuation allowances result from analysis of positive and negative evidence supporting the realization of tax benefits. Negative evidence includes a cumulative history of pre-tax operating losses in specific tax jurisdictions. Changes in valuation allowances have resulted in material fluctuations in our effective tax rate. Economic conditions may dictate the continued imposition of current valuation allowances and, potentially, the establishment of new valuation allowances. While significant valuation allowances remain, our effective tax rate will likely continue to experience significant fluctuations. Furthermore, certain foreign jurisdictions may take actions to delay our ability to collect value-added tax refunds. 
   Our efforts to grow and transform our businesses may require significant investments; if our strategies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. 
         We continuously evaluate opportunities for growth and change. These initiatives may involve making acquisitions, entering into partnerships and joint ventures, divesting assets, restructuring our existing operations and assets, creating new financial structures and building new facilitiesany of which could require a significant investment and subject us to new kinds of risks. We have incurred 
 40

   indebtedness to finance these opportunities, and we may incur additional indebtedness to finance future initiatives. We could also issue additional shares of stock of our Company or our subsidiaries to finance such initiatives. If our strategies for growth and change are not successful, we could face increased financial pressure, such as increased cash flow demands, reduced liquidity and diminished access to financial markets, and the equity value of our businesses could be diluted. 
         The implementation of strategies for growth and change may create additional risks, including:
 

 diversion of management time and attention away from existing operations; 
 requiring capital investment that could otherwise be used for the operation and growth of our existing businesses; 
 disruptions to important business relationships; 
 increased operating costs; 
 limitations imposed by various governmental entities; 
 use of limited investment and other baskets under our debt covenants; and 
 difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter. 

         Our inability to mitigate these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our strategies for growth and change could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may fail to fully achieve the savings or growth projected for current or future initiatives notwithstanding the expenditure of substantial resources in pursuit thereof. See "Risks Related to the Proposed Spin-Off" above for specific risks related to the proposed spin-off of our Pigments and Additives business. 
   We may have difficulties integrating acquired businesses and as a result, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. 
         We have completed a number of acquisitions and we will continue to acquire additional businesses and enter into joint ventures as part of our business strategy. Growth through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks, including:
 

 inability to efficiently operate new businesses or to integrate acquired businesses and products; 
 inability to accurately predict delays in realizing the costs and benefits of acquisitions, partnerships, or joint ventures; 
 unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of an acquired or existing business; 
 difficulties in retaining key employees of acquired businesses; 
 difficulties in realizing projected synergies; and 
 exposure to unanticipated liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures, product liability or illegal activities conducted by an
acquired company or a joint venture partner. 

         Our inability to address these risks could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
   Significant price volatility or interruptions in supply of our raw materials may result in increased costs that we may be unable to pass on to our customers, which could reduce our profitability. 
         We purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials from third-party suppliers and the cost of these raw materials represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses. The prices for a number 
 41

   of these raw materials generally follow price trends of, and vary with market conditions for, crude oil and natural gas feedstocks, which are highly volatile and cyclical. For example, the market for crude oil and natural gas feedstocks experienced depressed pricing throughout 2015 and 2016, leading to favorable prices for the raw materials that we purchase from third parties. Lower raw material prices, however, can lead to downward pressure on selling prices for certain of our products leading to reduced revenue. Any rebound in the pricing for such feedstocks could adversely affect our operating expenses. Our supply agreements typically provide for market-based pricing and provide us only limited protection against price volatility. While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding product price increases, we are not always able to raise product prices immediately or at all. Timing differences between raw material prices, which may change daily, and contract product prices, which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often, have had and may continue to have a negative effect on our cash flow. Any cost increase that we are not able to pass on to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
         In general, the feedstocks and other raw materials we consume are organic chemical commodity products that are readily available at market prices. There are, however, several raw materials for which there are only a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier. For example, titanium-containing feedstocks suitable for use in our titanium dioxide facilities are available from a limited number of suppliers around the world. To mitigate potential supply constraints, we frequently enter into supply agreements with particular suppliers, evaluate alternative sources of supply and evaluate alternative technologies to avoid reliance on limited or sole-source suppliers. In addition, where supply relationships are concentrated, particular attention is paid by the parties to ensure strategic intentions are aligned to facilitate long-term planning. If certain of our suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under present supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials from other sources and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished products to recoup the higher raw materials costs. Any interruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our costs or decrease our revenues, which could reduce our cash flow. The inability of a supplier to meet our raw material needs could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and results of operations. 
         The number of sources for and availability of certain raw materials is also specific to the particular geographical region in which a facility is located. Political and economic instability in the countries from which we purchase our raw material supplies could adversely affect their availability. In addition, if raw materials become unavailable within a geographic area from which they are now sourced, then we may not be able to obtain suitable or cost effective substitutes. We may also experience higher operating costs such as energy costs, which could affect our profitability. We may not always be able to increase our selling prices to offset the impact of any higher production costs or reduced production levels, which could reduce our earnings and decrease our liquidity. 
   The industries in which we compete are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors that have greater financial resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
         The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. Among our competitors are some of the world's largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources. Changes in the competitive landscape could make it difficult for us to retain our competitive position in various products and markets throughout the world. Some of the companies with whom we compete may be able to produce products more economically than we can. Furthermore, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. 
         While we are engaged in a range of research and development programs to develop new products and processes, to improve and refine existing products and processes, and to develop new applications 
 42

   for existing products, the failure to develop new products, processes or applications could make us less competitive. Moreover, if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. 
         Further, it is possible that we could abandon certain products, processes, or applications due to potential infringement of third party intellectual property rights or that we could be named in future litigation for the infringement or misappropriation of a competitor's or other third party's intellectual property rights, which could include a claim for injunctive relief and damages, and, if so, such adverse results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. In addition, certain of our competitors in various countries in which we do business, including China, may be owned by or affiliated with members of local governments and political entities. These competitors may get special treatment with respect to regulatory compliance and product registration, while certain of our products, including those based on new technologies, may be delayed or even prevented from entering into the local market. 
         Certain of our businesses use technology that is widely available. Accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low in certain product segments of our business. The entrance of new competitors into any of our businesses may reduce our ability to maintain margins or capture improving margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing. Further, petroleum-rich countries have become more significant participants in the petrochemical industry and may expand their roles significantly in the future. Increased competition in any of our businesses could compel us to reduce the prices of our products, which could result in reduced margins and loss of market share and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
   We are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems, and any failure to adequately protect our critical information technology systems could materially affect our operations. 
         We rely on information technology systems across our operations, including for management, supply chain and financial information and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability and capacity of these systems. Information technology system failures, network disruptions or breaches of security could disrupt our operations, cause delays or cancellations of customer orders or impede the manufacture or shipment of products, processing of transactions or reporting of financial results. An attack or other problem with our systems could also result in the disclosure of proprietary information about our business or confidential information concerning our customers or employees, which could result in significant damage to our business and our reputation. 
         We have put in place security measures designed to protect against the misappropriation or corruption of our systems, intentional or unintentional disclosure of confidential information, or disruption of our operations. Current employees have, and former employees may have, access to a significant amount of information regarding our operations which could be disclosed to our competitors or otherwise used to harm us. Moreover, our operations in certain locations, such as China, may be particularly vulnerable to security attacks or other problems. Any breach of our security measures could result in unauthorized access to and misappropriation of our information, corruption of data or disruption of operations or transactions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
         In addition, we could be required to expend significant additional amounts to respond to information technology issues or to protect against threatened or actual security breaches. We may not be able to implement measures that will protect against all of the significant risks to our information technology systems.

     Our significant debt level, a portion of which is subject to variable interest rates, makes us vulnerable to downturns and may limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to obtain additional financing or to refinance our debt. 
         We have significant outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2016, our total consolidated outstanding debt was $4,196 million (including current portion of debt); our debt to total capitalization ratio was approximately 74%; our combined outstanding variable rate borrowings were approximately $2.2 billion; and our current portion of debt totaled $60 million. Our debt level and the fact that a significant percentage of our cash flow is required to make payments on our debt could have important consequences for our business, including but not limited to the following:
 

 we may be more vulnerable to business, industry or economic downturns, making it more difficult to respond to market conditions; 
 cash flow available for other purposes, including the growth of our business, may be reduced; 
 our ability to refinance or obtain additional financing may be constrained, particularly during periods when the capital markets are unsettled; 
 our competitors with lower debt levels may have a competitive advantage relative to us; and 
 part of our debt is subject to variable interest rates, which makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates (for example, a 1%
increase in interest rates, without giving effect to interest rate hedges or other offsetting items, would increase our annual interest rate expense by approximately $22 million). 

         Our debt level also impacts our credit ratings. Any decision by credit rating agencies to downgrade our debt ratings could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing and could result in increased interest and other costs. 
   Agreements governing our debt may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or to obtain additional financing. 
         The agreements governing our debt arrangements contain certain restrictive covenants. These covenants may limit or prohibit our ability to among other things, incur additional indebtedness; make certain prepayments of debt; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; issue stock; make investments; create liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate; and transfer or sell assets. Some of our strategies may necessitate receiving consents or waivers under our debt arrangements, which could be withheld. 
         Our failure to comply with any of our debt covenants, or our failure to make payments of principal or interest on our debt, could result in a default, or trigger cross-default or acceleration provisions, under our debt agreements. An event of default could result in our debt obligations becoming immediately due and payable, cause our creditors to terminate their lending commitments, or force us or one or more of our subsidiaries into bankruptcy or liquidation. Any of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For more information regarding our debt covenants, see "Note 15. DebtCompliance with Covenants" to our consolidated financial statements. 
   Economic conditions and regulatory changes following the United Kingdom's likely exit from the EU could adversely impact our operations, operating results and financial condition. 
         Following a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom (the "U.K.") approved an exit from the EU, it is expected that the U.K. government will initiate a process to leave the EU (often referred to as Brexit). The referendum triggered short-term financial volatility, including a decline in the value of the pound sterling in comparison to both the U.S. dollar and euro. The future 
 44

   effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to the EU or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Given the lack of comparable precedent and the uncertainty around when the U.K. government will initiate the process to leave the EU, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU would have and how such withdrawal would affect our Company. 
         We derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales outside the U.S., including 29% from Europe. The consequences of Brexit, together with what may be protracted negotiations around the terms of Brexit, could introduce significant uncertainties into global financial markets and adversely impact the markets in which we and our customers operate. Brexit could also create uncertainty with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we and our customers in the U.K. are subject and lead to divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. government determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. 
         While we are not experiencing any immediate adverse impact on our financial condition as a result of Brexit, adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our future operations, operating results and financial condition. All of these potential consequences could be further magnified if additional countries were to exit the EU. 
   Our operations involve risks that may increase our operating costs, which could reduce our profitability. 
         Although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing and marketing of chemical and other products. These hazards include: chemical spills, pipeline leaks and ruptures, storage tank leaks, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other hazards incident to the manufacturing, processing, handling, transportation and storage of dangerous chemicals. We are also potentially subject to other hazards, including natural disasters and severe weather; explosions and fires; transportation problems, including interruptions, spills and leaks; mechanical failures; unscheduled downtimes; labor difficulties; remediation complications; and other risks. In addition, some equipment and operations at our facilities are owned or controlled by third parties who may not be fully integrated into our safety programs and over whom we are able to exercise limited control. Many potential hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities. Furthermore, we are subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure, exposure of contractors on our premises as well as other persons located nearby, workers' compensation and other matters. 
         We maintain property, business interruption, products liability and casualty insurance policies which we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices, as well as insurance policies covering other types of risks, including pollution legal liability insurance, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. Each of these insurance policies is subject to customary exclusions, deductibles and coverage limits, in accordance with industry standards and practices. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
         In addition, we are subject to various claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. We are a party to various pending lawsuits and proceedings. For more information, see "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" below. 
 45

          
  We are subject to many environmental, health and safety regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability. 
         We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment and human health and safety, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. Actual or alleged violations of environmental, health and safety, or EHS, laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations and substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some EHS laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. 
         Many of our products and operations are subject to the chemical control laws of the countries in which they are located. These laws include the regulation of chemical substances and inventories under the Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA") in the United States and the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals ("REACH") and the Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures ("CLP") regulations in Europe. Analogous regimes exist in other parts of the world, including China, South Korea, and Taiwan. In addition, a number of countries where we operate, including the United Kingdom, have adopted rules to conform chemical labeling in accordance with the globally harmonized system. Many of these foreign regulatory regimes are in the process of a multi-year implementation period for these rules. 
         Additional new laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted by various regulatory agencies globally. For example, in the U.S., the EPA finalized revisions to its Risk Management Program in January 2017. The revisions include new requirements for certain facilities to perform hazard analyses, third-party auditing, incident investigations and root cause analyses, emergency response exercises, and to publically share chemical and process information. Compliance for many of the rule's new requirements will be required beginning in 2021. In January 2017, the EPA temporarily delayed the rule's effect until March 21, 2017, and has indicated that it may further delay the rule's implementation. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration is likewise considering changes to its Process Safety Management standards. In addition, TSCA reform legislation was enacted in June 2016, and the EPA has begun the process of issuing new chemical control regulations. The costs of compliance with any new laws or regulations cannot be estimated until the manner in which they will be implemented has been more precisely defined. 
         Our international operations may also be impacted by new laws or regulations. For example, pursuant to the CLP, an EU Member State can propose a classification for a substance to the European Chemicals Agency ("ECHA"), which upon review by ECHA's Committee for Risk Assessment ("RAC"), can be submitted to the European Commission for adoption by regulation. On May 31, 2016, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety ("ANSES") submitted a proposal to ECHA that would classify titanium dioxide a Category 1B Carcinogen classification as presumed to have carcinogenic potential for humans by inhalation. Potential outcomes before both the RAC and the Commission is a final classification as a Category 1B Carcinogen (described by the EU regulation as "presumed to have carcinogenic potential for humans, classification is largely based on human evidence"), a Category 2 Carcinogen classification (described by the EU regulation as "suspected human carcinogens," classification on the basis of evidence obtained from human and/or animal studies, but which is not sufficiently convincing to place the substance in category 1A or 1B), or a decision of no classification, with the Commission making the final decision. Our Company, together with other companies, relevant trade associations and the European Chemical Industry Council ("Cefic") sector group, the Titanium Dioxide Manufacturers Association ("TDMA"), submitted comments opposing any classification of titanium dioxide as carcinogenic, based on evidence from multiple epidemiological studies covering more than 24,000 production workers at 18 titanium dioxide manufacturing sites over several decades that found no increased incidence of lung cancer as a result of workplace exposure to titanium dioxide and other 
 46

   scientific studies that concluded that the response to lung overload studies with poorly soluble particles upon which the ANSES proposed classification is based is unique to the rat and is not seen in other animal species or humans. If ECHA were to recommend, and the European Commission were to subsequently adopt, either a Category 1B or Category 2 Carcinogen classification, it could require that many end-use products manufactured would be classified as containing a potential carcinogenic component, which could negatively impact public perception of products containing titanium dioxide, limit the marketability of and demand for titanium dioxide or products containing titanium dioxide and potentially have spill-over, restrictive effects under other EU laws, e.g., those affecting medical and pharmaceutical applications, cosmetics, food packaging and food additives. Such classifications would also affect manufacturing operations by subjecting us to new work place requirements that could significantly increase costs. The resulting restrictions in the market place and impact on operations and profitability would be less significant in the event of a Category 2 classification for titanium dioxide compared to the Category 1B classification proposed by ANSES. 
         Furthermore, governmental, regulatory and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection could result in increased pressure for more stringent regulatory control with respect to the chemical industry. In addition, these concerns could influence public perceptions regarding our products and operations, the viability of certain products, our reputation, the cost to comply with regulations, and the ability to attract and retain employees. Moreover, changes in EHS regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations. Accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability. For example, several of our products are being evaluated under REACH and CLP regulations and actions thereunder could negatively impact sales. 
   Regulatory requirements to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
         Our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the Earth's climate. There are existing efforts to address GHG emissions at the international, national, and regional levels. For example, the 2015 Paris climate summit agreement resulted in voluntary commitments by numerous countries to reduce their GHG emissions. The agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016 and could result in additional firm commitments by various nations with respect to future GHG emissions. The EU also regulates GHGs under the EU ETS and China has begun pilot programs for carbon taxes and trading of GHG emissions in selected areas. Domestically, the EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan rules in 2015 that establish carbon pollution standards for power plants, called CO2 emission performance rates. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the implementation of the Clean Power Plan. This stay will remain in effect until the conclusion of the appeals process. It is not yet clear how the courts will rule on the legality of the Clean Power Plan. If the rules are upheld at the conclusion of this appellate process, and depending on how states decide to implement these rules, they may result in national or regional credit trading schemes. Collectively, these rules and agreements may affect the long term price and supply of electricity and natural gas and demand for products that contribute to energy efficiency and renewable energy. These various regulations and agreements are likely to result in increased costs to purchased energy, additional capital costs for installation or modification of GHG emitting equipment, and additional costs associated directly with GHG emissions (such as cap and trade systems or carbon taxes), which are primarily related to energy use. Compliance with these regulations and any more stringent restrictions in the future may increase our operational costs. 
         In addition, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, 
 47

   floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur in areas where we or our clients operate, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. 
         We could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future EHS laws. Capital expenditures and costs relating to EHS matters will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations. Capital expenditures and costs beyond those currently anticipated may therefore be required under existing or future EHS laws. 
         Furthermore, we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties or at off-site locations where we disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre-dated our purchase of our businesses. We may therefore incur additional costs and expenditures beyond those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future EHS laws. 
   Our operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected by legal claims against us, including antitrust claims. 
         We face risks arising from various legal actions, including matters relating to antitrust, product liability, intellectual property and environmental claims. It is possible that judgments could be rendered against us in these cases or others for which we could be uninsured or not covered by indemnity, or which may be beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. Over the past few years, antitrust claims have been made against chemical companies, and we have been named as a defendant in the antitrust suits discussed in "Item 3. Legal ProceedingsAntitrust Matters." In this type of litigation, the plaintiffs generally seek treble damages, which may be significant. An adverse outcome in any antitrust claim could be material and significantly impact our operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
   Financial difficulties and related problems experienced by our customers, vendors, suppliers and other business partners could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
         During periods of economic disruption, more of our customers than normal may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, restructurings and liquidations, which could affect our business by reducing sales, increasing our risk in extending trade credit to customers and reducing our profitability. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer's financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer's receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer. 
   Our business is dependent on our intellectual property. If our intellectual property rights cannot be enforced or our trade secrets become known to our competitors, our ability to compete may be adversely affected. 
         Proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses and other technology is important to our business. While a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us in the U.S., there can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Furthermore, if any pending patent application filed by us does not result in an issued patent, or if patents are issued to us, but such patents do not provide meaningful protection of our intellectual property, then our ability to compete may be adversely affected. Additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
         We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. While it is our policy to enter 
 48

   into agreements imposing confidentiality obligations upon our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, these confidentiality obligations may be breached, may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized access, use or disclosure of our trade secrets and know-how. In addition, others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. 
         We may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. We may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation or infringement in countries where effective patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and judicial systems may be unavailable, or may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. law. 
         The failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets or proprietary know-how or the failure of adequate legal remedies for related actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
   Conflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks, political events and general instability, along with increased security regulations related to our industry, could adversely affect our business. 
         Conflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks and political events have precipitated economic instability and turmoil in international commerce and the global economy. The uncertainty and economic disruption resulting from hostilities, military action or acts of terrorism may impact any or all of our facilities and operations or those of our suppliers or customers. Accordingly, any conflict, military action or terrorist attack that impacts us or any of our suppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Furthermore, instability and turmoil, particularly in energy-producing nations, may result in raw material cost increases. 
         Changes in social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently develop and sell products, could adversely affect our business. For example, a number of governments have instituted regulations attempting to increase the security of chemical plants and the transportation of hazardous chemicals, which could result in higher operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. 
   If our subsidiaries do not make sufficient distributions to us, then we will not be able to make payment on our debts. 
         Our debt is generally the exclusive obligation of Huntsman International and our guarantor subsidiaries. Because a significant portion of our operations are conducted by nonguarantor subsidiaries, our cash flow and our ability to service indebtedness, including our ability to pay the interest on our debt when due and principal of such debt at maturity, are dependent to a large extent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from such nonguarantor subsidiaries. Any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances by our nonguarantor subsidiaries to us could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, and any restrictions imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our nonguarantor subsidiaries. In addition, payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings. 
         Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and, except for our guarantor subsidiaries, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on our debt or to make any funds 
 49

   available for those amounts, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of, our debt. Any right that we have to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary, and the consequent right of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the sale of their assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by that subsidiary. 
   Regulatory or market changes with respect to MTBE may materially reduce our sales and/or materially increase our costs. 
         We produce MTBE, an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline. Because of the allegations that MTBE has contaminated some water supplies, its use has become controversial in the U.S. and elsewhere, and its use has been effectively eliminated in the U.S. market. We currently market MTBE, either directly or through third parties, to gasoline additive customers located outside the U.S. This business has been profitable to us over time, and future legislative or regulatory initiatives or changing consumer opinion outside the U.S. restricting MTBE or changing consumer opinion could materially adversely affect our ability to market and sell MTBE and our profitability. Expansion of our PO/MTBE operations, including our joint venture with Sinopec in China, will further expose us to these risks. 
         While we could use all or a portion of our precursor TBA to produce saleable products other than MTBE, this would require significant capital expenditures to modify our facilities. Moreover, the sale of other products would produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of MTBE. 
   Our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations are currently underfunded, and under certain circumstances we may have to significantly increase the level of cash funding to some or all of these plans, which would reduce the cash available for our business. 
         We have unfunded and underfunded obligations under some of our domestic and foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rates used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which would reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, a decrease in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plans and future contributions, as well as the periodic pension cost in subsequent fiscal years. 
         With respect to our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") has the authority to terminate an underfunded tax-qualified pension plan under limited circumstances in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. In the event our tax-qualified pension plans are terminated by the PBGC, we could be liable to the PBGC for the entire amount of the underfunding and, under certain circumstances, the liability could be senior to our notes. With respect to our foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans, the effects of underfunding depend on the country in which the pension and postretirement benefit plan is established. For example, in the United Kingdom and Germany semi-public pension protection programs have the authority in certain circumstances to assume responsibility for underfunded pension schemes, including the right to recover the amount of the underfunding from us.

  RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK AND DEBT SECURITIES 
   Certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and, therefore, limit your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value. 
         Certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, such as limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders, the inability of stockholders to call special meetings and certain provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our Company, even if some of our stockholders were to consider such a change of control to be beneficial. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. Therefore, our Board of Directors could elect to issue preferred stock that has special voting or other rights that could make it even more difficult for a third party to acquire us, which may reduce or eliminate your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value. 
   We have purchased, and may continue to purchase, a portion of our equity and debt securities, which could impact the market for our equity and debt securities and likely would negatively affect our liquidity. 
         Consistent with past practices, we may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem our equity and debt securities in open market purchases, accelerated repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, partial or full calls for redemption or otherwise. Any such repurchases or redemptions and the timing and amount thereof would depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Such transactions could negatively affect our liquidity.
