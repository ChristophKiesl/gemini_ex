Introduction 
 We are a blank check company incorporated on February 10, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. 
 In February 2021, we issued an aggregate of 5,750,000 shares of our Class B common stock (the “Founder Shares”) to our Sponsor in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, a purchase price of approximately $0.004 per share. The number of Founder Shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such Founder Shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares upon completion of our initial public offering (our “Public Offering”). The per share purchase price of the Founder Shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the Company by the aggregate number of Founder Shares issued. In October 2021, in connection with our Public Offering, our Sponsor forfeited a total of 90,000 Founder Shares to us for no consideration, and we then issued 30,000 Founder Shares to each of our three independent directors at their original purchase price. Also in October 2021, in connection with our Public Offering, we effected a stock dividend of 1,150,000 Founder Shares on the Founder Shares, which resulted in our Sponsor owning 6,810,000 Founder Shares. Such stock dividend has been accounted for retroactively to all periods. The holders of our Founder Shares prior to our Public Offering are referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our “initial stockholders.” 
 On the Closing Date, we consummated our Public Offering of 24,000,000 units (the “Units”) and, on October 22, 2021, the underwriters in our Public Offering purchased an 3,600,000 additional Units upon the full exercise of their over-allotment option, resulting in the sale of 27,600,000 Units in the aggregate. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to us of $276,000,000. Each Unit consists of one share of our Class A common stock and three quarters of one warrant. Each whole warrant (a “public warrant”) entitles the holder thereof to purchase one whole share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, and only whole warrants are exercisable. The warrants will become exercisable on the 30th day after the completion of our initial business combination and will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 
 On the Closing Date, simultaneously with the consummation of our Public Offering, we completed a private placement of 11,600,000 private placement warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per warrant to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds to us of approximately $11,600,000 and, on October 22, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the over-allotment option, we completed a private placement of 1,440,000 additional Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of $1.00 per warrant to our Sponsor, generating additional gross proceeds to us of approximately $1,440,000 (such private placements, collectively, the “Private Placement”). Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one whole share of our Class A common stock at $11.50 per share. The Private Placement Warrants (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. 
 Approximately $281,520,000 of the net proceeds from our Public Offering and the Private Placement has been deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the “Trust Account”). 
 We received gross proceeds from our Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants of $276,000,000 and $13,040,000, respectively, for an aggregate of $289,040,000. $281,520,000 of the gross proceeds were deposited into the Trust Account. The $281,520,000 of net proceeds held in the Trust Account includes $9,660,000 of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions that will be released to the underwriters of our Public Offering upon completion of our initial business combination. Of the gross proceeds from our Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants that were not deposited in the Trust Account, $5,520,000 was used to pay underwriting discounts and commissions in our Public Offering, approximately $195,000 was used to repay loans and advances from our Sponsor, and the balance was reserved to pay accrued offering and formation costs, business, legal and accounting due diligence expenses on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses.

  The Founder Shares that we issued prior to the Closing Date will automatically convert into shares of our Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts sold in our Public Offering and related to the closing of the initial business combination, the ratio at which the shares of our Class B common stock will convert into shares of our Class A common stock will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of our Public Offering plus all shares of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial business combination (after giving effect to any redemptions of shares of our Class A common stock by public stockholders and excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination and any private placement warrants issued to our Sponsor, any affiliate of our Sponsor or any of our officers or directors upon conversion of any working capital loans). 
 On November 9, 2021, we announced that, commencing November 12, 2021, holders of the Units sold in our Public Offering may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A common stock and public warrants included in the Units. The shares of Class A common stock and public warrants that are separated will trade on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbols “BMAC” and “BMAC WS,” respectively. Those Units not separated will continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol “BMAC.U” 
 Our Company 
 The Company was established by Rhett Bennett, founder of various natural resource companies in the oil and gas, metals and other sectors (the “Black Mountain Entities”), including Black Mountain Oil & Gas LLC, Black Mountain Oil & Gas II LLC, Black Mountain Sand LLC, Black Mountain Metals LLC, Black Mountain Minerals LLC, Wing Resources LLC and Black Mountain Midstream LLC, many of which he continues to lead as Chief Executive Officer. Since 2007, Rhett Bennett has led the growth of the Black Mountain Entities across several business units, including exploration and production operations, commercial saltwater disposal, midstream and in-basin frac sand mining. We believe that the experience, capabilities and strong reputation of Rhett Bennett and the other members of our management team will make us an attractive partner to potential target businesses, enhance our ability to complete a successful business combination and bring value to the business following such combination. 
 We believe that there are currently many attractive investment opportunities in the energy sector. Low commodity prices have stressed the balance sheets and financial and operational flexibility of many companies and have resulted in a number of restructurings, forced corporate sales, mergers and the disposition of assets. Additionally, public equity and debt providers have substantially reduced their investments in the exploration and production sector, which has raised the cost of capital for most non-investment grade exploration and production companies and limited M&A transaction volume due to the decrease in qualified buyers. Certain company and asset valuations in the energy sector have reached historic lows as a result of current market dislocation. We believe these market conditions have also put a focus on technologies that can increase oil and gas productivity and reduce costs. 
 We intend to identify and acquire a business that could benefit from a hands-on owner with extensive transactional, financial, managerial and investment experience in the energy value chain that presents potential for an attractive risk-adjusted return profile under our stewardship. Even fundamentally sound companies can often underperform their potential due to underinvestment, a temporary period of dislocation in the markets in which they operate, over-levered capital structures, excessive cost structures, incomplete management teams and/or inappropriate business strategies. We believe that our management team has a unique and differentiated perspective based upon our broad, 24-year heritage investing across global energy markets. We believe that we are well positioned to identify attractive risk-adjusted returns in the marketplace and that our contacts and transaction sources, ranging from industry executives, private owners, private equity funds and investment bankers will enable us to pursue a broad range of opportunities. We believe many businesses in the exploration and production industry or broader energy value chain could benefit from access to public markets but have been unable to do so due to a number of factors, including the time and expense required to conduct a traditional initial public offering, market volatility and pricing uncertainty.

  Past performance of our management team or businesses associated with Rhett Bennett or any of our other officers or directors is not a guarantee either (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of such businesses or our officers and directors as indicative of our future performance of an investment in the Company or the returns the Company will, or is likely to, generate going forward. 
 In addition, our officers have agreed not to act as officers of other blank check companies until the earlier of our execution of a definitive agreement for an initial business combination, our liquidation or such time as such officer ceases to be an officer of the company. However, our Sponsor, officers and directors may act as investors or directors or otherwise participate in other blank check companies during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such company may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates, though we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to complete an initial business combination. 
 Human Capital Management 
 We currently have two officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 We have registered our Units, Class A common stock and public warrants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act’), and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials (as applicable) sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), or reconciled to GAAP, or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that any applicable requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
