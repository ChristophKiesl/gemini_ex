Item 1. Business.
Overview
Drive Shack Inc., which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, together with its subsidiaries, as the Company, we and us, is an owner and operator of golf-related leisure and social entertainment venues and courses focused on bringing people together through competitive socializing, by combining sports and entertainment with elevated food and beverage offerings. The Company was formed in 2002 and its common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol as “DS.” Our mission is to become the largest venue-based competitive socializing and entertainment platform in the country. 
We conduct our business through three operating segments: (1) Entertainment Golf, (2) Traditional Golf and (3) corporate.
•Entertainment Golf | Drive Shack
Drive Shack offers leisure and social entertainment through its golf-related leisure and large-format entertainment venues with gaming and premier golf technology, a chef-inspired menu, craft cocktails, and engaging social events throughout the year. Each Drive Shack venue features expansive, climate-controlled, suite style bays with lounge seating; augmented-reality golf games and virtual course play; a restaurant and multiple bars; an outdoor patio with lawn games; and arcade games. 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company owned or leased four Drive Shack venues located in Orlando, Florida; West Palm Beach, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Richmond, Virginia. Additionally, the Company is committed to leases in New Orleans, Louisiana and in Manhattan (Randall’s Island), New York for its entertainment golf venues. Drive Shack venues are freestanding 60,000 square feet open-air venues built on approximately 12 acres.
•Traditional Golf | American Golf 
American Golf, acquired by the Company in December 2013, is one of the largest operators of golf properties in the United States. As an owner, lessee, and manager of golf courses and country clubs for over 45 years, we believe American Golf is one of the most experienced operators in the traditional golf industry. As of December 31, 2020, we owned, leased or managed 60 properties across 9 states, and have more than 30,000 members. American Golf is focused on delivering lasting experiences for our guests who played over 2.2 million rounds at our properties during 2020.
Our traditional golf operations are organized into three principal categories based on the nature of the revenue streams generated by the following properties: (1) public properties (leased and owned), (2) private properties (leased and owned) and (3) managed properties (public and private).
Public Properties.   Our 30 leased public properties generate revenues principally through daily green fees, golf cart rentals and food, beverage and merchandise sales.  Amenities at these properties generally include practice facilities, pro shops and food and beverage facilities.  At certain locations, our public properties have larger clubhouses with extensive banquet facilities. In addition, The Players Club is a fee-based monthly membership program offered at most of our public properties, with membership benefits ranging from daily range access and off-peak course access to the ability to participate in golf clinics.
Private Properties.   Our five leased or owned private properties, which are open primarily to members and their guests, generate revenues principally through initiation fees, membership dues, food, beverage and merchandise sales, and guest fees. Amenities at these properties typically include practice facilities, full-service clubhouses with a pro shop, locker room facilities and multiple food and beverage outlets, including grills, restaurants and banquet facilities.
Managed Properties. Our 25 managed properties are operated by American Golf pursuant to management agreements with the owners of each property.  We recognize revenue from each of these properties in an amount equal to a management fee and the reimbursements of certain operating costs.
During 2020, the Company sold one public owned golf property for an aggregate sale price of $34.5 million, resulting in a gain of $16.6 million. As of December 31, 2020, we have successfully sold 25 of our 26 owned golf properties for a total aggregate sales price of $204.2 million.
During 2020, the Company entered into a total of four new management agreements. One of the new management agreements related to the golf property sold during the year and another related to a terminated lease but in both instances, the Company was retained as manager.
See Note 5 in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.
Growth Strategy
We believe that golf as a sport and form of entertainment continues to expand from spending time at an elite exclusive country club to include a more hip, upbeat, social experience, which increases demand across a broader potential base of customers. As a result of this expansion, the hospitality and leisure spaces associated with these new forms of a traditional sport are evolving to appeal to a different, vibrant and new audience and customer base in the leisure and entertainment industry.The rapidly growing competitive socializing market combines entertainment, sports, and dining to address the shift in consumer preferences for social and interactive experiences. This more than $1 trillion market is led by the interest of the 72-million-person millennial segment of consumers. Research across this segment indicates that 78% of millennials prefer to spend money on an experience versus buying something material and that 70% of consumers prefer to dine at entertainment formats versus traditional casual restaurants for group occasions. 
As we build our brand through the existing operation of Drive Shack locations and through the new Puttery locations, we continue to strengthen our position in this growing industry. We believe there is significant opportunity for Drive Shack to capture market share given the industry disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic and the structural decline of dated businesses, coupled with the rising demand for social and interactive entertainment options. We have strategically aligned our Drive Shack and Puttery businesses to provide competitive, social and interactive experiences to capitalize on this unique and timely opportunity, as we feel other entertainment concepts in our industry have failed to address the shift in consumer preferences. There are a variety of consumers who seek out active socializing options. We will use data and testing to understand their unique drivers and mindsets, test consumer behaviors, spending habits, and finally optimize to find the most effective way to target, acquire, and retain consumers.
We believe Drive Shack is the only company comprised of a truly integrated portfolio of both Entertainment and Traditional Golf businesses, which provides us with a unique opportunity to unlock top site locations by leveraging the operational experiences and municipal relationships developed by our Traditional Golf business. 
•New Venue Development and Growth | Puttery 
The Puttery is our new, indoor entertainment golf experience set to debut in summer 2021, with the first two venues opening in Dallas, Texas and Charlotte, North Carolina
Puttery is expected to expand our business by diversifying our experiential offerings with a modern spin on indoor mini golf through auto-scoring technology that presents digital scores to guests in real-time. Each location will feature a series of tech-enabled miniature golf courses anchored by bars and other social spaces and exceptional food and beverage offerings that will serve to create engaging and fun experiences for our guests.
Our Puttery venues require much less space, approximately 15,000 – 20,000 sq. ft. of indoor new or existing retail space. The new smaller format is expected to expand venue potential by hundreds of markets due to the vast availability of real estate, shorter development timelines, less capital risk and higher development yields compared to large format venues.
Puttery enables us to expand our national footprint with growth potential across hundreds of markets due to shorter development timelines, lower capital risk and higher potential development yields. Advanced data and demographic analytics will allow us to strategically evaluate and develop a robust pipeline of target sites in prioritized markets across the United States. As we look to further grow our Puttery brand, the smaller format offers us the opportunity to improve investment returns and take advantage of the vast availability of retail space at a potential discount.
Today, we have agreements in place with landlords to develop our first two Puttery locations. We plan to launch our first Puttery in the summer of 2021 in Dallas, Texas, followed soon thereafter by a second location in Charlotte, North Carolina. We will analyze the performance of these first two locations, assessing whether results are in line with our projections and financial expectations. Optimizations and adjustments will be made, if needed, to further refine our operational and financial models as we expand our Puttery national footprint. We have previously announced plans for 
an additional five Puttery locations that will open or be near completion by the end of 2021 and open an additional 10 locations by the end of 2022.
•A Modernized Socializing Experience
Current Consumer Preferences. Our portfolio of current and future entertainment venues directly addresses consumers’ changing preferences and provides a new type of leisure with multiple experiences under one roof, including:
•Social Entertainment – A unique and curated experience where guests can interact, compete and socialize in a sophisticated, fun setting.
•Sports – Technology forward activities and robust gaming platforms that promote competition and create unique and lasting experiences.
•Food & Beverage – A complete social experience is rounded out by exceptional food and beverage options. Along with heightened visual and audio cues, craft cocktails and curated food choices will enhance the overall experience for every consumer.
•Inclusivity – An activity and experience that allows everyone to participate and enjoy, regardless of skill level.
Our focus is on creating an environment that enables friendly competition and connecting with friends and family, providing our guests with memorable and meaningful experiences. These experiences are designed to cater to a range of audiences and competitive appetites, to attract new guests and to drive loyalty and advocacy among our existing guests.
Innovation. Golf as a sport and form of entertainment continues to transform. We believe innovation is at the essence of creating the modernized, broadly appealing golf and entertainment experience. In an industry with a high degree of competition, innovation serves as a key differentiator. We strive to innovate across all our offerings including technology powered golf games, food and beverage menu offerings, and venue formats. Our proprietary gaming software allows us the ability to consistently develop and launch new games. In 2021, we also plan to introduce Puttery, our new smaller format venues, providing a modern spin on the classic game of mini golf through the innovative use of auto-scoring technology that presents digital scores to guests in real-time. 
Technology. We have arrangements with our golf ball tracking technology partners for both our Drive Shack venues and new smaller format Puttery venues. We pair these ball-tracking technologies with our in-house proprietary gaming software to create state-of-the-art gaming experiences. We have purposefully designed our gaming software to be ultra-flexible, allowing us to develop, test, and launch new games continuously.
Our Drive Shack venues are equipped with radar-based TrackMan™ technology, which provides precision ball tracking, in real time, affording us the ability to bring our augmented reality gaming to the next level. Our proprietary gaming software provides us with the unique ability to continuously develop and release cutting edge, fun and engaging games. Our current suite of proprietary games includes Darts, Monster Hunt, ShackJack and Pro Range. We intend to refresh our existing games and supplement with new releases periodically. In addition, our partnership with TrackMan™ provides our guests with access to an extensive portfolio of world-famous virtual golf courses. These games and virtual golf courses are suitable for all skill sets and competitive appetites.
Elevated Food & Beverage. Our venues feature chef-inspired food offerings alongside inventive craft cocktails. Our menus feature a thoughtfully curated selection of shareable food options, further enabling the socializing nature of our venues. In March 2020, we launched a new food menu focusing on upscaling our menu items. Our new menu is designed and tailored to consumer preferences and lifestyle trends, offering unique flavors, and high-quality fresh ingredients to create a premium selection of options to appeal to our broad range of guests. 
Alongside our new food menu, will be our revamped beverage offerings that will feature a variety of beers, craft cocktails, non-alcoholic cocktails, canned wine and seltzers, and premium spirits. Our beer selection will consist of local and regional craft beers that will vary by venue locations. In certain locations, we have partnerships with local breweries which source and produce exclusive beverages in both our Drive Shack and Puttery venues. 
We plan to rollout new seasonal or limited time offerings, to supplement our core menu and give our guests more reasons to keep coming back as well as attract new guests. 
Events. Our venues provide an electric atmosphere for experiential event options spanning corporate events to social gatherings. Each venue features climate-controlled bays, 300-plus television screens, a rooftop terrace with fire pits, and private indoor and outdoor meeting spaces fully equipped with A/V technology and wi-fi, that can accommodate a variety of group sizes up to 1,200 guests. Our event packages feature an elevated chef-inspired catering menu and beverage packages, that are customizable to our guests. Our dedicated event team handles everything from planning to execution to create memorable and meaningful experiences for all our event participants.
While the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on our large group events business in 2020, we promoted unique, safe and socially distant packages for small group gatherings. Our 2-Bay Package was created to encourage small event bookings across our Drive Shack locations, which allows for groups of 10 people or less to reserve two bays and includes a generous food and beverage credit and two hours of golf play.
•Site selection, development, and the experience
Site Selection. Our site selection process is integral to the successful execution of our growth strategy. Our site selection process is led by our Real Estate Committee and integrates a variety of analytical measures with an evaluation of key factors of the overall quality and viability of potential sites. These factors include but are not limited to size and quality of land and existing real estate space; population demographics, such as target population density and household income levels; competition levels in the market; site visibility, accessibility and traffic volume; proximity to other entertainment facilities, restaurants and bars; and market or landlord incentives.
Venue Development. Our Drive Shack venue formats are generally open-air 60,000 square feet venues on average built on approximately 12 to 15 acres of land. This format features 72 to 96 plus climate-controlled bays with lounge seating and an approximately 200 yard outfield. The total investment cost of a new Drive Shack venue ranges from $25 to $40 million. We may either enter into a long-term ground lease or purchase the land for our Drive Shack venue format. The average development time for our large format Drive Shack venue is 18 to 24 months.
We are currently committed to leases in New Orleans, Louisiana and in Manhattan (Randall’s Island), New York for future Drive Shack entertainment golf venues.

Our new smaller format Puttery venues are targeted at between 15,000 to 20,000 square feet of existing indoor space. This format will feature multiple courses, depending on venue size and layout. The total investment cost of a new smaller format Puttery venue is expected to range from $7 to $11 million, exclusive of landlord incentives. We believe the development timeline for our new smaller format Puttery venues will average 6 to 9 months in total and will vary based on the unique layout of each venue.
We plan to open our first two Puttery venues in Dallas, Texas and Charlotte, North Carolina in summer 2021 and plan to open or be near completion of five additional Puttery venues by the end of 2021.     
On occasion, we expect that our various venue formats may be smaller or larger or cost more or less than our targeted range, depending on the specific circumstances of the selected site or market. 
Transcending the Experience. At Drive Shack, we look to create meaningful and memorable experiences by combining world class golf technology, great drinks, delicious food and welcoming environments. Our Drive Shack venues are organized and designed to spread and amplify guest energy and revolutionize the golf and competitive socializing experience. We encourage our guests to interact with other guests by way of carefully placed bars and lounges, social event areas, outdoor patios and climate-controlled bays. The lighting, finishes and furniture are contemporary yet comfortable and are purposely organized for group interaction and a social atmosphere. Whether a golfer or not we want everyone to feel comfortable experiencing our version of golf.
Our new smaller format Puttery venues consist of character filled, exciting, adult focused mini-golf and leisure spaces with social interaction in mind. Each location is customized to create unique ways to mingle with your friends for a night out, have drinks with colleagues or meet new people. These bar forward mini-golf spaces blend vintage golf with upscale casual lifestyle through the strategic placement of the lounges, bars, courses and VIP spaces within each venue. The courses are intimate, transformative and designed specifically to keep people connected and socializing while playing technology enhanced mini golf. Beverage and food opportunities are plentiful with multiple bars and a full-service kitchen. Our lounge furniture and finishes are all created with a comfortable yet upscale experience.
Marketing
•Growing Brand Awareness
Continuing to build and grow brand awareness is our priority. Our strategy consists of multiple layers, which includes local and national data and demographic profiles to identify interests and behaviors, competitors and consumption habits of our target consumers. We expect that our new agency partners are developing creative content and messaging that will both continue to grow our Drive Shack and American Golf business and bring the Puttery brand successfully to market. Marketing will always be a full funnel strategy, including paid and earned media, digital, social, video, out-of-home, events, customer relationship management (“CRM”), influencer marketing, content creation, and celebrity collaboration. Our CRM and loyalty programs are being built to help ensure that we are targeting and retaining our core consumers and using data driven analytics to build messaging that will grow retention and brand loyalty.
•Embracing Local Communities
Local Partnerships. Each Drive Shack venue prides itself on forging bonds with local partners in the community. For example, our core Drive Shack venue in Richmond has a continued partnership with a local brewery, which created and produces an exclusive premium beer for our venue; while our Drive Shack venue in Raleigh has recently partnered with a local female-owned brewery, to create a new, soon to be released, specialty beverage. We have also collaborated with a local specialty ice cream shop to create a new scratch rendition of the classic ice cream sandwich inspired by Drive Shack and Arnold Palmer, called the Chilly Palmer. We plan to continue to explore local partnerships and collaborations that may vary by venue and geographic location. 
•Customized Programming and Promotions
Unique Programs. Our guest experience is enhanced by ongoing events and programs designed to engage a range of guest desires, including quarterly Social Leagues and Summer Swing Academy, which introduces young kids to golf in a fun, relaxed environment. Intended to drive new and repeat guests to our venues, we introduced Limited Time Offers ("LTOs") that are rolled out on a quarterly basis. The LTOs typically include three new food and three new beverage offerings that have been created and inspired by our talented chefs in each of our Drive Shack venues
We also have designed some of our programming around seasonal events, including March Madness, National Beer Day, and Easter, with our family themed Easter Egg Hunt. We prioritized innovating new ways for guests to compete within the venue and in 2020, we developed a new, repeatable tournament model, Drive Shack Open, for use at our large format entertainment venues. The Drive Shack Open is geared towards more competitive, avid golfers and is structured as a single-day tournament, with four-person teams, a team entry fee and prizes awarded to teams based on scores. In December 2020, we debuted our first Drive Shack Open tournament, which was met with huge demand as all available team slots were sold out in advance of the tournament. We have also developed an in-venue tournament model, Monster Hunt Challenge, that is geared towards less serious players and non-golfers. The Monster Hunt Challenge is structured as a 4-week tournament model built specifically for competition with "high score" tournament mentality for both groups and solo players, with unlimited entries at a low cost per entry fee and prizes awarded based on highest score.
Promotional Campaigns. We periodically develop promotional programs to attract new guests and increase the length of stay and spend per visitor. Our promotional programs include Happy Hour specials, offering discounted food and beverage selections during specified periods of time. We also launched a new winter promotion “$12 Tuesdays” offering $12 per hour bay play to appeal to our existing guests and to encourage new guests to experience our version of golf in climate-controlled bays. We also launched a 2-Bay promotional package in Fall 2020 that allows for groups of 10 guests or less to reserve two bays and includes a generous food and beverage credit and two hours of play for a reasonable set price. This has been a successful promotion and event revenue has increased meaningfully since the launch. Additionally, we offered a half-price game play promotion through most of 2020 following the reopening of our three Gen 2.0 Drive Shack venues in the second quarter after their temporary closures due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March 2020. In Orlando, we created a game play promotional pass in December 2020 upon the reopening of that venue. 
Intellectual Property
We have registered the trademark Drive Shack® and American Golf® and their primary logos and the trademarks relating to Puttery and have registered or applied to register certain additional trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark 
Office and in various foreign countries. We consider our trade name and our logo to be important features of our operations and seek to actively monitor and protect our interest in this property in the various jurisdictions where we operate. We also have certain trade secrets, such as our recipes, processes, proprietary information and certain software programs that we protect by requiring all of our employees to accept an agreement to keep trade secrets confidential in connection with their onboarding process.
Policies with Respect to Certain Other Activities
Subject to the approval of our board of directors, we have the authority to offer our common stock or other equity or debt securities to raise cash financing, in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities and may engage in such activities in the future. We also may make loans to, or provide guarantees of certain obligations of, our subsidiaries. We may engage in the purchase and sale of investments. Our officers and directors may change any of these policies and any investment guidelines without a vote of our stockholders. Our board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval (subject in certain cases to NYSE shareholder approval requirements), to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate, including in exchange for cash or property.
Competition 
We operate in a highly competitive industry and compete primarily on the basis of location, featured facilities, quality and breadth of product offerings and price. As a result, competition for market share in the industry in which we compete is significant.
Our Entertainment Golf business competes with restaurants, dining and social clubs and other entertainment attractions including movie theaters, sporting events, bowling alleys, sports activity centers, arcades and entertainment centers, nightclubs and theme parks. Many of the entities operating these businesses are larger and better capitalized, have a greater number of stores, have been in business longer and are better established with stronger name recognition in the markets where our Entertainment Golf and new smaller format Puttery venues are located or are planned to be located. As a result, they may be able to invest greater resources than we can in attracting customers and succeed in attracting customers who would otherwise come to our venues. In addition, the competition is subject to frequent innovations in the products and services offerings which could significantly impact our ability to attract and retain new and recurring guests.
Our Traditional Golf properties compete on a local and regional level with other country clubs and golf properties. The level of competition in the Traditional Golf business varies from region to region and is subject to change as existing facilities are renovated or new facilities are developed.
For more information about the competition we face generally and in our Entertainment and Traditional Golf businesses specifically, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Competition in the industry in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.”
Seasonality 
Seasonality can affect our results of operations. Our Traditional Golf business is subject to seasonal fluctuations as colder temperatures and shorter days reduce the demand for outdoor activities. As a result, the Traditional Golf business generates a disproportionate share of its annual revenue in the second and third quarters of each year. In addition, our Entertainment Golf business and our new smaller format Puttery venues could be significantly impacted on a season-to-season basis, based on corporate event and social gathering volumes during holiday seasons and school vacation schedules. For this reason, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indicator of our current and/or future performance.
Government Regulation of Our Business
Our properties and operations are subject to a number of environmental laws. As a result, we may be required to incur costs to comply with the requirements of these laws, such as those relating to water resources, discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by regulated materials. Under these and other environmental requirements, we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases from currently owned, formerly owned or operated facilities.
Environmental laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability on a property owner without regard to whether the property owner knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. We may use certain substances and generate certain wastes that may be deemed hazardous or toxic under such laws, and from time to time have incurred, and in the future may incur, costs related to cleaning up contamination resulting from historic uses by us or by previous owners of certain of our current or former properties or our treatment, storage or disposal of wastes at facilities owned by others. Our facilities are also subject to risks associated with mold, asbestos and other indoor building contaminants. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of regulated materials may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use, transfer or obtain financing for our property. We may be required to incur costs to remediate potential environmental hazards, mitigate environmental risks in the future, or comply with other environmental laws and regulations.
In addition, in order to build, improve, upgrade or expand some of our facilities, we may be subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act and, for projects in California, the California Environmental Quality Act. Both acts require that a specified government agency study any proposal for potential environmental impacts and include in its analysis various alternatives. Any improvement proposal may not be approved or may be approved with modifications that substantially increase the cost or decrease the desirability of implementing the project.
We are also subject to regulation by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions. These regulations impact a number of aspects of operations, including golf course maintenance and food handling and preparation.
The ownership and operation of our facilities subjects us to federal, state and local laws regulating zoning, land development, land use, building design and construction, and other real estate-related laws and regulations.
Our facilities and operations are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the ADA. The ADA generally requires that we remove architectural barriers when readily achievable so that our facilities are made accessible to people with disabilities. In addition, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, included additional compliance requirements for golf facilities and recreational areas. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. Federal legislation or regulations may further amend the ADA to impose more stringent requirements with which we would have to comply.
We are also subject to various local, state and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. For instance, we must comply with provisions regulating equal employment, wage and hour practices and licensing requirements and regulations for the sale of food and alcoholic beverages.
Taxation
On February 23, 2017, the Company revoked its election to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or a REIT, effective January 1, 2017. The Company operated in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes through December 31, 2016. Since January 1, 2017, we have generally been subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and distributions to stockholders paid on or after January 1, 2017 are not deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial. Although we have net operating loss carryforwards that may be available to reduce our taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes and thereby reduce such tax liability, a portion of such carryforwards may be limited in its use due to certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the Code. Therefore, no assurances can be given that those losses will remain usable or will not become subject to limitations (including under the "ownership change" provisions under Section 382 of the Code). In particular, if the Company has undergone or were to undergo an “ownership change” for purposes of Section 382 of the Code, the Company could incur materially greater tax liability than if the Company had not undergone such an ownership change. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Tax Status and the 1940 Act.”
Employees
Entertainment Golf
As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 551 employees in our Entertainment Golf segment including: 481 hourly venue employees, 36 venue managers and 34 corporate personnel.
Traditional Golf

Our board of directors consists of a majority of independent directors under the NYSE listing standards. The Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of our board of directors are composed exclusively of independent directors. We have adopted corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics, which delineate our standards for our directors, officers and employees.
