ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

The Company
As of April 30, 2021 Casey’s General Stores, Inc. (“Casey’s”) and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (Casey’s, together with its subsidiaries, are referred to herein as the “Company” or “we”) operate convenience stores under the names "Casey's" and “Casey’s General Store” (hereinafter referred to as “Casey’s Store” or “Stores”) in 16 Midwestern states, primarily in Iowa, Missouri, and Illinois. The Company also operates two stores under the name "Tobacco City", selling primarily tobacco and nicotine products, one liquor store, and one grocery store. The Casey's Stores carry a broad selection of food (including freshly prepared foods such as pizza, donuts, and sandwiches), beverages, tobacco and nicotine products, health and beauty aids, automotive products, and other nonfood items. In addition, all but three offer fuel for sale on a self-service basis. 
Our fiscal year runs from May 1 through April 30 of each year. On April 30, 2021, there were a total of 2,243 stores in operation. There were 40 stores newly constructed in fiscal 2021, and we closed 11 stores in fiscal 2021. We also acquired 5 stores in fiscal 2021; 2 of those stores were opened in fiscal 2021, and 3 will be opened during the 2022 fiscal year. Finally, we opened 5 acquisitions purchased in the prior year. Three distribution centers are in operation (in Ankeny, Iowa adjacent to our corporate headquarters, which we call the Store Support Center, in Terre Haute, Indiana and in Joplin, Missouri) from which certain grocery and general merchandise items are supplied to our stores. Casey’s, with its principal business office, and Store Support Center located at One SE Convenience Blvd., Ankeny, Iowa 50021-8045 (telephone 515-965-6100), was incorporated in Iowa in 1967.
Approximately 55% of all our stores were opened in areas with populations of fewer than 5,000 persons, while approximately 19% of our stores were opened in communities with populations exceeding 20,000 persons. The Company competes on the basis of price, as well as on the basis of traditional features of convenience store operations such as location, extended hours, product offerings, and quality of service.
The Company’s internet address is www.caseys.com. Each year we make available through our website all of our SEC filings, including current reports on Form 8-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our annual report on Form 10-K, and amendments to those reports, free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with the SEC. Additionally, you can go to our website to read our Financial Code of Ethics for the CEO and Senior Financial Officers, Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and committee charters. In the event of a waiver to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, any required disclosure will be posted to our website.
General
Casey's purpose is to make the lives of our guests and communities better every day. Smaller communities often are not served by national-chain convenience stores. We have succeeded in operating Casey’s Stores in smaller towns by offering, at competitive prices, a broader selection of products than does a typical convenience store. We have also succeeded in meeting the needs of residents in larger communities with these offerings. We currently own most of our real estate, including substantially all of our stores, all three distribution centers, a construction and support services facility, and the Store Support Center facility.
The Company derives its revenue primarily from the retail sale of fuel and the products offered in our stores. Our sales historically have been strongest during the first and second fiscal quarters (May through October) relative to the third and fourth fiscal quarters (November through April). In warmer weather, guests tend to purchase greater quantities of fuel and certain convenience items such as beer, isotonics, water, soft drinks, and ice.
Corporate Subsidiaries
Casey's Marketing Company ("CMC") and Casey's Services Company ("CSC") were organized as Iowa corporations in March 1995. Casey’s Retail Company ("CRC") was organized as an Iowa corporation in April 2004. CGS Stores, LLC was organized in April 2019 as an Iowa limited liability company. Heartland Property Company, LLC was organized in September 2019 as a Delaware limited liability company. CMC, CSC, and CRC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Casey’s. CGS Stores, LLC and Heartland Property Company, LLC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of CMC.
CRC owns and operates stores in Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Michigan, holds the rights to the Company's trademarks, service marks, trade names, and other intellectual property, and performs most “corporate” functions of the enterprise. CMC owns and operates stores in Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin, and is responsible for all of our wholesale operations, including all three distribution centers. CGS Stores, LLC owns and operates stores in Tennessee. CSC provides a variety of construction, maintenance and transportation services for all stores. 
Store Operations
Products Offered
Our focus at Casey’s is to design, develop and deliver value to guests through a differentiated product assortment where the right products are optimally placed, priced and aggressively promoted to drive traffic, revenue and profit. It is our practice to continually make additions to the Company’s product line, especially products with higher gross profit margins. As a result, we have added various prepared food items to our product line over the years, facilitated by the installation of kitchens, which now are in most stores.
We began selling handmade pizza in 1984, and it was available in 2,235 stores (99.6%) as of April 30, 2021. Although pizza is our most popular prepared food offering, we continue to expand our prepared food product line, which currently includes made to order cheesy breadsticks, sandwiches/wraps, wings, popcorn chicken, chicken tenders, breakfast croissants and biscuits, breakfast pizza, breakfast burritos, hash browns, quarter-pound hamburgers and cheeseburgers, potato cheese bites and other seasonal items. As of April 30, 2021, the Company was selling donuts in 2,236 (99.7%) of our stores in addition to cookies, brownies, and other bakery items. 
The growth in our prepared food program reflects management’s strategy to promote high-margin products that are compatible with convenience store operations. In the last three fiscal years, retail sales of nonfuel items have generated about 41% of our total revenue, but they have resulted in approximately 72% of our revenue less cost of goods sold (excluding depreciation and amortization). Revenue less cost of goods sold (excluding depreciation and amortization) as a percentage of revenue on prepared food items averaged approximately 61% for the three fiscal years ended April 30, 2021—substantially higher than the impact of retail sales of fuel, which averaged approximately 11%.
Each Casey’s store typically carries over 3,000 food and non-food items. The selection is a blend of differentiated Casey’s Private Label products, as well as favored national and regional brands, many of which can be found in larger format stores. Our assortment includes product across the following categories: 
•Non-Alcoholic Beverages (Soft Drinks, Energy, Water, Sports Drinks, Juices, Coffee, Tea & Dairy)
•Alcoholic Beverages (Beer, Wine and Spirits) 
•Packaged Foods (Snacks, Candy, Packaged Bakery & other food items)
•Tobacco & Nicotine Products
•Frozen Foods (Ice, Ice Cream, Meals & Appetizers)
•Non-Foods (Health & Beauty Aids, Automotive, Electronic Accessories, Housewares and Pet Supplies)
•Services (Lotto/Lottery & Prepaid Cards)
During fiscal 2021, Casey’s invested heavily in it’s Private Brand product portfolio to support the corporate re-branding that was unveiled in October. We expanded our portfolio to over 175 Casey’s Brand items, more than doubling our product count from last year, bringing even more value to our guests. We launched over 100 new or reformulated items which included significant packaging improvements .
All but three Casey’s Stores offer retail motor fuel products for sale on a self-service basis. Gasoline and diesel fuel are sold under the Casey’s name.
Store Design
Casey’s Stores are primarily freestanding and, with a few exceptions to accommodate local conditions, conform to standard construction specifications. The current larger store design measures approximately 2,900 square feet devoted to sales area, 550 square feet to kitchen space, 400 square feet to storage, and 2 large multi-stall public restrooms. There is also a smaller store design that is generally designated for smaller communities that measures approximately 1,700 square feet devoted to sales area with the remaining areas similar in size, and 2 single user restrooms. Store lots have sufficient frontage 
and depth to permit adequate drive-in parking facilities on one or more sides of each store. Each new store typically includes 5 to 10 islands of fuel dispensers and storage tanks with capacity for 60,000 to 70,000 gallons of fuel. The merchandising display follows a standard layout designed to encourage a flow of guest traffic through all sections of every store. All stores are air-conditioned and have modern refrigeration equipment. Nearly all the store locations feature a bright sign which displays Casey’s name and trade/service marks. 
All Casey’s Stores remain open at least sixteen hours per day, seven days a week. Hours of operation may be adjusted on a store-by-store basis to accommodate guest traffic patterns. As of April 30, 2021, we operated 384 stores on a 24-hour basis, and another 1,640 have expanded hours. Store hours have continued to shift back to pre-COVID 19 levels, as we temporarily reduced hours at many locations in response to the pandemic. All stores maintain a bright, clean interior and provide prompt checkout service. 
Store Locations
The Company traditionally has located its stores in smaller towns not served by national-chain convenience stores. Management believes that a Casey’s Store provides a service generally not otherwise available in small towns and that a convenience store in an area with limited population can be profitable if it stresses sales volume and competitive prices. Our store-site selection criteria emphasize the population of the immediate area and daily highway traffic volume. We can operate effectively at a highway location in a community with a population of as few as 400.
Fuel Operations
Fuel sales are an important part of our revenue and earnings. Approximately 55% of Casey’s total revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021 was derived from the retail sale of fuel. The following table summarizes (dollars and gallons in thousands) fuel sales for the last three fiscal years ended April 30:

 | Year ended April 30,
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Number of gallons sold | 2,180,772 | | | 2,293,609 | | | 2,296,030 | 
Total retail fuel sales | $ | 4,825,466 | | | $ | 5,517,412 | | | $ | 5,848,770
Percentage of total revenue | 55.4 | % | | 60.1 | % | | 62.5 | %
Percentage of revenue less cost of goods sold (excluding depreciation and amortization and credit card fees) | 15.8 | % | | 11.1 | % | | 8.0 | %
Average retail price per gallon | $ | 2.21 | | | $ | 2.41 | | | $ | 2.55 
Average revenue less cost of goods sold per gallon (excluding depreciation and amortization and credit card fees) | 34.91 | ¢ | | 26.81 | ¢ | | 20.30 | ¢
Average number of gallons sold per store* | 981 | | | 1,055 | | | 1,097 | 


* | Includes only those stores in operation at least one full year on April 30 of the fiscal year indicated.

Average retail prices of fuel during the year decreased 8.3% from prior year. The total number of gallons we sold during this period decreased by 4.9%. Same-store gallons sold were impacted by softer demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Average revenue less cost of goods sold (excluding depreciation and amortization and credit card fees) per gallon increased by 30.2%, which was influenced by COVID-19 demand dynamics, macroeconomic factors with regard to certain oil producing nations and the efforts of our centralized fuel team. Our centralized fuel team, coupled with fuel procurement improvements, continues to grow profitability and has been instrumental in sustaining higher than normal average revenue less cost of goods sold per gallon (excluding depreciation and amortization and credit card fees). 
Percentage of revenue less cost of goods sold (excluding depreciation and amortization and credit card fees) represents the fuel gross profit divided by the gross fuel sales dollars. As retail fuel prices fluctuate in a period of consistent gross margin per gallon, the percentage will also fluctuate in an inverse relationship to fuel price. For additional information concerning the Company’s fuel operations, see Item 7 herein.
Distribution and Wholesale Arrangements
CMC supplies all stores with groceries, food, health and beauty aids, and general merchandise from the distribution centers. The stores place orders for merchandise electronically to the Store Support Center, and the orders are filled with shipments in Company-operated delivery trucks from one of the distribution centers, based on route optimization for the fleet 
network. Most of our existing and proposed stores are within the three distribution centers' optimum efficiency range—a radius of approximately 500 miles around each distribution center. 
In fiscal 2021, a majority of the food and nonfood items supplied to stores from the distribution centers were purchased directly from manufacturers. With few exceptions, long-term supply contracts are not entered into with the suppliers of products sold by Casey’s Stores. We believe the practice enables us to respond to changing market conditions with minimal impact on margins.
Human Capital
Our employees, who we refer to as Team Members, are critical to our business operations and the success of the Company. As of April 30, 2021, we had 17,960 full-time, and 19,245 part-time, Team Members. Approximately 35,043 are store Team Members, approximately 242 are field management and related Team Members, approximately 387 work in and support our three distribution centers, approximately 436 are fuel or grocery drivers and approximately 1,097 work out of the Store Support Center, or perform Store Support Center functions which support the organization.
We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements with our Team Members and believe the working relationship with our Team Members is good.
COVID-19 Response: From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company established a cross-functional task-force for the continuous monitoring of the impact of COVID-19 on our Team Members and business operations and to implement measures to manage Team Member and guest safety and other risks. In addition, throughout the pandemic, our Team Members, who were designated as “essential workers”, safely and diligently ensured our distribution centers remained open and operational and that our guests continued to be served.
In response to COVID-19, the Company implemented a number of health, safety and other measures, in which it has invested over $38 million in fiscal 2021 ($50 million since the start of the pandemic), which at certain times throughout the past year have included the following: increased all store and distribution center Team Member pay by an additional $2 per hour; provided additional operational bonuses to key field support Team Members; provided additional paid leave for impacted Team Members; provided additional paid flextime; mandated working remotely where possible; implemented health checks intended to maintain well-being in all distribution centers; provided personal protective equipment and implemented a store mask mandate; offered a $50 vaccination bonus for fully vaccinated Team Members; established 6-foot markings in stores to encourage social distancing; installed plexiglass shields at cash registers; designated exclusive shopping times for higher-risk guests; implemented enhanced cleaning and hygiene practices throughout our stores, at our fuel dispensers, distribution centers, and the Store Support Center.
Total Rewards: We believe that the future success of the Company depends in large part on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate qualified Team Members. As such, we are committed to providing market-competitive pay and benefits for all positions and offer performance-based compensation opportunities to a large portion of our full-time Team Member base. In addition, the Company offers a 401(k) plan to eligible employees, with a generous 6% match made in the form of Company stock, and all full-time and part-time associates are eligible for competitive health and welfare benefits, including medical, dental, vision, disability, life insurance and other benefits.
Diversity and Inclusion: The Company is committed to building a diverse and inclusive workforce across the organization, which it believes is set by example with its Board of Directors and extended leadership team. The Board consists of nine members, seven (or 78%) of which are diverse as to gender, race and/or ethnicity. The extended leadership team consists of twenty-six members, of which thirteen (or 50%) are diverse as to gender, race and/or ethnicity. We have a strict Anti Harassment and Discrimination Policy of which all Team Members are trained and expected to follow. Additionally, we have several mechanisms, including an Ethics and Compliance Hotline, under which Team Members and guests can report incidents confidentially or anonymously and without fear of retaliation.
Education and Training: The Company, including its established Learning and Development Department, which serves all levels of the organization, invests significant resources of time and money in educating and training Team Members by providing them with educational, development and leadership opportunities. These opportunities are provided through a mix of formal onboarding training, safety training, in-person classes, virtual modules and “on-the-job” learning. In addition, the Company has a formal leadership development program, which seeks to provide Team Members with skills necessary for leading their teams and advancing in their careers.
Competition
Our business is highly competitive. Food, including prepared foods, and nonfood items similar or identical to those sold by the Company are generally available from various competitors in the communities served by Casey’s Stores. We believe our stores located in smaller towns compete principally with other local grocery and convenience stores, similar retail outlets, and, to a lesser extent, prepared food outlets, restaurants, and expanded fuel stations offering a more limited selection of grocery and food items for sale. Stores located in more heavily populated communities may compete with local and national grocery and drug store chains, quick serve restaurants, expanded fuel stations, supermarkets, discount food stores, and traditional convenience stores. Examples of convenience store chains competing in the larger towns served by Casey’s Stores include Quik Trip, Kwik Trip, Kum & Go, and other regional chains. Some of the Company’s competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. These competitive factors are discussed further in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
Trademarks and Service Marks
The names "Casey’s" and “Casey’s General Store” and the marks consisting of the Casey’s design logos (with the words “Casey’s” and “Casey’s General Store”) and the weathervane are registered trademarks and service marks under federal law. We believe these marks are of material importance in promoting and advertising the Company’s business. The Company has a number of other registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks that are significant to the Company from an operational and branding perspective (e.g. "Casey’s Pizza",  "Casey's Here for Good", “Casey’s Rewards”, “Casey’s Cash”, etc.).

Government Regulation (dollars in thousands)
The United States Environmental Protection Agency and several states, including Iowa, have established requirements for owners and operators of underground fuel storage tanks (USTs) with regard to (i) maintenance of leak detection, corrosion protection, and overfill/spill protection systems; (ii) upgrade of existing tanks; (iii) actions required in the event of a detected leak; (iv) prevention of leakage through tank closings; and (v) required fuel inventory record keeping. Since 1984, our new stores have been equipped with noncorroding fiberglass USTs, including some with double-wall construction, overfill protection, and electronic tank monitoring. We currently have 5,102 USTs, 4,241 of which are fiberglass and 861 are steel, and we believe that all capital expenditures for electronic monitoring, cathodic protection, and overfill/spill protection to comply with the existing UST regulations have been completed. Additional regulations or amendments to the existing UST regulations could result in future expenditures.
Several states in which we do business have trust fund programs with provisions for sharing or reimbursing corrective action or remediation costs incurred by UST owners, including the Company. For the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, we spent approximately $849 and $718, respectively, for assessments and remediation. Substantially all of these expenditures were submitted for reimbursement from state-sponsored trust fund programs. As of April 30, 2021, approximately $24,181 has been received from such programs since inception. The payments are typically subject to statutory provisions requiring repayment of the reimbursed funds for noncompliance with upgrade provisions or other applicable laws. None of the reimbursements received are currently expected to be repaid by the Company to the trust fund programs. At April 30, 2021, we had an accrued liability of $368 for estimated expenses related to anticipated corrective actions or remediation efforts, including relevant legal and consulting costs. We believe we have no material joint and several environmental liability with other parties.
