Item 1. Business.
Overview
Etsy offers markets, services and technology that empower creative entrepreneurs and shape a positive future for business. Our mission is to reimagine commerce in ways that build a more fulfilling and lasting world. As of December 31, 2016, our platform connected 1.7 million active Etsy sellers and 28.6 million active Etsy buyers, in nearly every country in the world. 
We believe we are creating a new economy, which we call the “Etsy Economy.” The Etsy Economy is where creative entrepreneurs find meaningful work and access to both global and local markets for their goods, and where thoughtful consumers discover and buy unique goods and build connections with the people who sell them. Our community is made up of these creative entrepreneurs and thoughtful consumers as well as the Etsy employees who maintain our platform and build innovative technology, the retailers who participate in our Etsy Wholesale offering, the production partners who offer manufacturing assistance to Etsy sellers and the shareholders who have invested in our commitment to our mission. 
Supporting creative entrepreneurs is the heart and soul of Etsy. We have a seller-aligned business model: we make money when our Etsy sellers make money, so we continue to invest in building the platform they depend on.
Our markets provide creative entrepreneurs with access to thoughtful consumers around the world. Buyers come to Etsy.com to find what they are looking for among nearly 45 million unique items across more than 50 retail categories. We also offer a wide range of Seller Services and tools that are specifically designed to help creative entrepreneurs start, manage and scale their businesses. 
In 2016, Etsy sellers generated Gross Merchandise Sales (“GMS”) of $2.8 billion, of which approximately 48% came from purchases made on mobile devices. We are a global company and 30.4% of our 2016 GMS came from an Etsy seller or an Etsy buyer outside of the United States. 
Our revenue is diversified, generated from a mix of market activities and the Seller Services we provide to Etsy sellers to help them start, manage and scale their businesses. Our largest market is Etsy.com. In 2017, we plan to launch a dedicated craft supplies market called Etsy Studio. We also own A Little Market, or ALM, a handmade and supplies market for sellers and buyers in France. Markets revenue is primarily made up of two components: the 3.5% transaction fee an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction on Etsy.com and the $0.20 listing fee she pays for each item she lists on Etsy.com. Seller Services revenue includes the fees Etsy sellers pay us for services, which include Direct Checkout, our payment processing service; Promoted Listings, our ad service for prominent placement in on-site search results; Shipping Labels, which allow Etsy sellers to directly purchase shipping labels through our platform; and Pattern by Etsy, launched in April 2016, which enables Etsy sellers to easily create their own custom website. Other revenue typically includes revenue generated from commercial partnerships.
Etsy was founded in June 2005 in Brooklyn, New York. On April 21, 2015, we completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) and our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “ETSY.”
Values and Impact
At Etsy, values are not a nice-to-have; they’re an integral part of how we do business. We work hard to ensure that our values guide our decision making and are integrated into every aspect of our business and operations. Our values help drive our business forward as a force for good and help us build the Etsy Economy.
We believe that a growing number of consumers consider the environmental and social impact of their purchases. We also believe that consumers will demand more of the businesses they support and that the companies best positioned to succeed will build win-win solutions that are good for people, the planet and profit. As such, we believe that values and impact alignment is critical to growing our business sustainably and positioning us for success in the future.
In 2016, we formed our Values Aligned Business (“VAB”) team, whose mandate is to ensure that Etsy’s mission, values and impact goals are embedded in all aspects of our culture, products, services, business and leadership. The VAB team is conducting a review process to ensure that our values continue to live up to these ideals. We are committed to the spirit of our 
1

current values as we focus on ways to deepen our impact and continue to: incorporate and build human connection in commerce, act with courage, serve our community, be accountable and drive diversity and inclusion.
We are a mindful, transparent and humane business. We believe that business interests and social and environmental responsibility are interwoven and aligned and that the power of business should be used to strengthen communities and empower people. To demonstrate our commitment, we monitor our efforts to minimize the harm and maximize the benefit that we have on people and the planet and then publish an annual Progress Report to publicly report our results.
We plan and build for the long term. We want to build a company that lasts, and we plan to measure our success in years and decades. Etsy sellers in particular depend on us and on our platform to grow their businesses, so we will strive to make decisions that are best for the long-term health of our ecosystem. Our ecosystem consists of Etsy and the people and communities around the world who benefit from our platform. 
We value craftsmanship in all we make. Craftsmanship is the marriage of skill and passion. We are an engineering-driven company, and we think of our code as craft: we are makers of the products and services that members of our community use, and we approach the work we do with the same care and inspiration as do Etsy sellers.
We believe fun should be part of everything we do. Our mission includes fostering a world in which personal fulfillment and purpose is a key element of success. We believe that this way of working is connected and joyful.
We keep it real, always. We have the courage and the will to do business in ways that are unconventional and impactful. When we believe that we are not being true to our values or our mission, we are not afraid to change course.
We are also dedicated to creating a net positive environmental, social and economic impact through our business. For example, in 2016 we established our goal of running Etsy.com as a carbon neutral market. We took steps toward this aspiration with the launch of Etsy Solar, a program which helps our seller community in the United States go solar and creates carbon offsets for our Etsy.com market. We also committed to power our offices and data centers with 100% renewable electricity by 2020 and currently have onsite solar at our Brooklyn and Hudson (New York) offices. 
Our Community
Our community includes Etsy sellers, Etsy buyers, Etsy employees, our partners and investors.
Etsy Sellers: Creative Entrepreneurs
Etsy sellers join our community to participate in our vibrant markets to express their creativity and turn their passion into a business while connecting to thoughtful consumers around the world. As of December 31, 2016, there were 1.7 million active sellers on our platform, 15.2% of which have been selling on Etsy.com for more than four years.

Etsy Sellers

We support a diverse group of artists, makers, designers and collectors from around the world—from the solo artisan to the full-time jewelry maker with staff; from the antique furniture collector to the textile graphic designer partnering with a small-batch manufacturer. 
We survey our sellers every two years and in November 2016, we conducted a survey of Etsy sellers who made a sale in the preceding 12 months. The 2016 seller survey, which included responses from 5,000 sellers, reveals a unique population of creative entrepreneurs who are building businesses on their own terms—prioritizing flexibility, independence and creativity. Digital platforms and mobile devices make it increasingly easy for these entrepreneurs to reach a global audience and for them to conduct business whenever and from wherever they'd like. Etsy sellers range from hobbyists to professional merchants, and have a broad range of personal and professional goals. The 2016 seller survey showed some Etsy sellers are looking for extra pocket money, while others depend on their shops to support themselves and their families. According to our 2016 seller survey, among Etsy sellers:


• | 87% identify as women;


• | 73% consider their Etsy shop to be a business;


• | 33% use their creative business as their sole occupation;


• | 97% run their shops from their homes;


• | 81% aspire to grow their sales in the future; and


• | 62% started their Etsy shop as a way to supplement income.

Etsy Buyers: Thoughtful Consumers
Etsy buyers visit Etsy.com to discover a broad selection of unique goods that are hard to find elsewhere, with items ranging from a $5 ornament, to a $50 hand-knit sweater, to a $2,000 custom-made table. In a 2016 survey of Etsy.com buyers, 91% agreed that Etsy offers products they cannot find elsewhere. We believe many Etsy buyers are motivated by more than simply price and convenience; we believe they also value craftsmanship, artistry, uniqueness, authenticity and sustainability. In our markets, Etsy buyers can enjoy a personalized shopping experience and build relationships through direct interactions with Etsy sellers. Etsy buyers can also purchase customized items, bespoke goods or unique and unexpected craft supplies from Etsy sellers. By buying in our markets, Etsy buyers are supporting creative entrepreneurs in their local communities and around the world. As of December 31, 2016, there were 28.6 million active buyers on our platform. 
Etsy Employees 
We too are members of our community. Whether drafting our policies, talking with Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers in our online forums, enhancing search functionality to help buyers better find what they're looking for or building new services and tools that help sellers start, manage and scale their businesses, our employees create genuine and lasting connections in our community. Etsy employees build personal relationships with Etsy sellers by visiting their shops, inviting them to our offices for lunch or celebrating with them at in-person events. In addition, our employees, including management, are encouraged to perform support rotations to foster connections with Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers and to help us better understand their needs.
We pride ourselves on our values-based and purpose-driven work culture. We focus on maximizing our employees’ professional and personal well-being. We evaluate employee performance on traditional business metrics and on adherence to our mission and values.
We believe employee engagement comes from fulfilling work focused on serving the needs of our sellers and buyers and from ample personal and professional growth opportunities. We invest heavily in employee development by offering coaching, skills workshops and training. We actively encourage personal education through arts and crafts workshops and employee-taught classes called “Etsy School,” covering subjects ranging from screen printing to Python programming. We also offer our employees paid time off to volunteer so that they can support the causes and organizations they are passionate about. In 2016, we introduced a 26-week gender-blind parental leave policy that is available to all Etsy employees globally. Through this policy we aim to support and enable parents to play equal roles in building successful companies and nurturing their families. Fortune magazine has recognized us as a great place to work every year since 2013. 
Etsy engineering is widely known for its thought-leading approaches to software development as well as its unique engineering culture. Our engineering team coined the phrase “Code as Craft” to describe our love for building software and our melding of 
3

engineering discipline and individual craftsmanship. We believe our engineers have the skills, practices and experience needed to embrace the change the future inevitably brings. 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,043 employees worldwide, with 648 in our offices in Brooklyn, New York. Of those employees, we had 319 in engineering, 124 in product, 187 in member operations, 276 in corporate and 137 in marketing. 
We believe that a diverse workforce makes us a better company, and we strive to create opportunities for underrepresented groups to join, thrive and advance at Etsy. For example, we proactively work and recruit to improve the gender balance at all levels of our company. As of December 31, 2016, 56% of employees identified as female. As of December 31, 2016, 58% of managers and 36% of product, engineering and technical operations employees identified as female. We are committed to improving the diversity within our workforce, and we publish an annual Progress Report that details our progress toward this goal. 
Our Partners
Our community also includes retailers who participate in our Etsy Wholesale offering and production partners who assist Etsy sellers who want to scale their businesses through our Etsy Manufacturing offering. Within Etsy Wholesale, retailers, nearly all of which are local boutiques, use our platform to connect directly with Etsy sellers and to add unique and distinctive items to their store offerings. As of December 31, 2016, there were 25,000 retailers on the platform. Etsy Manufacturing helps Etsy sellers who want to grow their business and connect directly with production partners. For example, an Etsy seller might work with a cut-and-sew shop to make clothes she has designed, a casting house that casts wax models for her jewelry designs or a digital printer that prints her photographs on household items.
Investors
We consider investors important stakeholders in our business. We strive to maintain transparent and open communications with the investment community, as appropriate, and appreciate those who support and believe in our long-term mission to reimagine commerce. 
Our Opportunity
We believe that the nature of commerce is changing: people are choosing to purchase goods online or from a mobile device, consumers are looking for unique items rather than mass produced goods and more people than ever are seeking employment outside of the traditional nine-to-five workplace. We believe that these trends create a strong, long-term market opportunity for Etsy allowing us to continue to expand our markets globally by attracting buyers who want something different than a conventional, mass-produced retail shopping experience and sellers who are engaging in their creative passion, working for themselves and defining success on their own terms. 
The retail landscape continues to change as more people around the world choose to purchase goods online or from a mobile device. eMarketer, a market research company, estimated that worldwide retail ecommerce sales were $2 trillion in 2016, up from $1.5 trillion in 2015. They expect worldwide retail ecommerce to generate double-digit growth each year through 2020, and sales to reach $4 trillion by the end of the four-year period. (Source: eMarketer - Worldwide Retail Ecommerce Sales: The eMarketer Forecast for 2016.) Whereas most large retailers emphasize efficiency and scale and pressure their suppliers to reduce their costs in order to offer goods produced at volume at the lowest-possible prices, our approach to commerce is fundamentally different and based on human connections. We believe that many consumers want to purchase goods that are unique and that reflect their personality and style, not simply mass-produced, generic goods. Finding these goods can be difficult, as markets for such goods have historically been highly fragmented across boutiques, consignment stores and other venues and marketplaces. Etsy sellers offer goods in over 50 retail categories, including furniture, jewelry, stationery, clothing, home goods, craft supplies and vintage items. 
Two of our largest opportunities are to raise awareness among potential and existing buyers about the breadth and depth of items available on Etsy.com and to encourage them to make more frequent purchases. Given the more than 50 retail categories in which Etsy sellers have offerings, we believe we can establish Etsy.com as a shopping destination not just for gifts and special occasions, but also for goods buyers use in their everyday lives. We also believe that this perception shift and our efforts to make the shopping experience easier for Etsy buyers through technological enhancements to our capabilities in areas such as search and recommendations will encourage buyers to make more frequent purchases in our markets. In addition, we believe that our new market, Etsy Studio, will help us serve our craft supplies sellers better and reach a broader audience of craft supplies buyers around the world. According to the Association for Creative Industries, creative products is an approximately 
4

$44 billion market in the United States. However, the vast majority of sales currently take place offline (Source: Association for Creative Industries - 2016 Creative Products Size of the Industry Study.) Etsy Studio offers a differentiated buyer experience that combines shopping and inspiration in one destination, which we believe creates a unique online opportunity for Etsy within this large addressable market.
The nature of work also continues to shift and more people than ever are choosing employment outside of traditional nine-to-five jobs. According to a McKinsey Global Institute study (the “Mckinsey Study”), 20-30% of the working-age population, or up to 162 million people, currently engage in independent work in the U.S. and E.U.-15. The McKinsey Study notes that 30-45% of the working-age population in these countries say they would like to earn either primary or supplemental income through independent work and consider themselves at least somewhat likely to pursue the option, implying the number of independent workers in the U.S. and the E.U.-15 could grow to up to 267 million. (Source: McKinsey Global Institute - Independent work: Choice, Necessity, and the Gig Economy.) We believe that our base of Etsy sellers reflects these changing dynamics. Active sellers on Etsy grew at 18% CAGR between 2013 and 2016 as more and more people chose to start a business. Additionally, our 2016 seller survey found that 33% of sellers in our markets have their creative business as their sole occupation, compared to 30% in our 2014 seller survey, reflecting an increasing number of people that are choosing to focus on independent work full time. As more and more people around the world choose to pursue their passions, we are focused on providing creative entrepreneurs with a global base of millions of buyers and a cohesive suite of services and tools specifically designed to support them as they start, manage and scale their businesses. 
Our Platform
Etsy leverages technology to connect people around the world through commerce. Our platform includes our markets, our services and our technology, which help foster a loyal, engaged community of sellers and buyers. Our commitment to transparency and integrity underpins our platform and establishes trust within our markets and our community. 

Key Components of Our Platform

Our Markets
Our markets offer an engaging way for an Etsy buyer to find millions of unique handmade and vintage goods as well as craft supplies. 
Launched in 2005, Etsy.com is our largest market and it supports people buying and selling in nearly every country in the world. It offers buyers nearly 45 million unique listings of handmade and vintage goods and craft supplies. We believe that that the breadth and depth of the items available help to position Etsy.com as a go-to shopping destination for more than just special occasions. We plan to launch Etsy Studio in 2017, which will serve as a dedicated craft supplies market. We believe our ability to leverage our prior investments in Etsy.com, including search technology, payments, advertising and shipping, to launch and scale Etsy Studio will give us a competitive advantage in this market and any other markets we may launch. We also own ALM, a handmade and supplies market for sellers and buyers in France. 
To help Etsy buyers discover and purchase items that they love, we focus on providing a number of tools and features within our Etsy.com market:

• | Personalized search and discovery. Our platform is engineered to provide a personalized experience to each Etsy buyer, adjusting in real time based on her interactions within it. An Etsy buyer may search for an item using our search tool bar and filter the results by color, price, location or other characteristics. Additionally, she may browse through items, creating an activity feed by “favoriting” items that catch her eye and by following shops and tastemakers. We glean insights from Etsy buyers’ purchases and other interactions within our platform through our machine learning 

5

algorithms, cookies and other techniques. Knowing and understanding each buyer's individual tastes and interests allows us to personalize each experience, whether a buyer comes to simply browse our site or app or to search for specific items. Improvements that we made to search in 2015 enable buyers to more easily browse, filter for and buy that perfect item, particularly on a mobile device, even when they do not have a specific item in mind. In 2016, we made additional enhancements to search and acquired Blackbird Technologies, Inc., or Blackbird, a privately-held company that had developed proprietary machine learning technology to deliver superior search relevance and recommendations. We believe we have several opportunities to further enhance our search capabilities and plan to leverage our technology to power a range of search capabilities including more personalized search, ranking, spelling correction and predictive type-ahead to deliver a personalized shopping experience.

• | Connected experience across all devices—mobile and desktop. We want to engage Etsy buyers wherever they are and to provide an enjoyable and accessible shopping experience no matter how they come to Etsy. Our Etsy.com website and iOS and Android mobile apps include search and discovery, curation, personalization and social shopping features. We offer a connected experience through each channel, desktop, mobile web, and mobile app, ensuring that no matter what device she uses she will have the best possible experience. To optimize our mobile experience, we use deep linking to automatically transition Etsy buyers from mobile web to the mobile app when they encounter a link to an Etsy shop or item. Buyers can sign-up and sign-in to Etsy through Facebook and Google and our payment and digital wallet options include Apple Pay, Google Wallet and others. Our mobile apps have been downloaded approximately 41 million times as of December 31, 2016.


• | Global reach combined with local scale. There are people using our platform to buy and sell in nearly every country in the world. Our platform makes it easy for Etsy buyers and Etsy sellers to connect across borders even if they do not speak the same language and wish to transact in different currencies. We use innovative machine translation technology to translate listings, reviews, product ads, and conversations between Etsy buyers and Etsy sellers. Our payments platform makes it easy for Etsy sellers to offer Etsy buyers a wide range of payment options. In addition to providing buyers with access to global inventory, we are also building local communities and fostering local connections. For example, our localized search feature, which is available in the U.K., Australia, France, and Germany, surfaces local items more prominently in search results so that buyers can easily connect with and purchase from sellers within their respective countries. In 2016, 33.3% of Etsy sellers were located outside the United States, and 30.4% of our GMS involved an Etsy seller or Etsy buyer outside of the United States.


• | Direct communication between sellers and buyers. We believe human connection is central to Etsy buyers’ engagement. Etsy buyers and Etsy sellers use the Conversations tool on our platform to communicate, person to person, about their orders, to request custom goods or personalization of goods or simply to have a conversation about the product or the process. In 2016, 56% of our active buyers sent or received a conversation and 67% of active sellers sent or received a conversation using our Conversations tool. In addition to our Conversations tool, we encourage engagement between Etsy buyers and Etsy sellers in a variety of ways, whether it be through sharing reviews on social media or connecting offline through the Etsy Local feature on our mobile app.

Our Services
Our platform makes it easy for an Etsy seller to open a shop and operate her business. According to our 2016 seller survey, for every hour that an Etsy seller spends making her products, she spends almost another hour doing business-related tasks, including inventory management, marketing, shipping, customer service and accounting.

How an Etsy Seller Spends Her Time


We are creating a cohesive platform of Seller Services and tools that help Etsy sellers start, manage and scale their businesses. Our services platform includes the following: 

• | Seller Services. We offer a variety of services to help Etsy sellers build their personal brands, engage potential customers and complete transactions. We currently have four Seller Services, all of which were developed in-house:


• | Direct Checkout. Direct Checkout allows Etsy sellers to accept various forms of payment such as credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, Google Wallet, Apple Pay and Etsy Gift Cards. Once an Etsy buyer makes payment, the Etsy seller receives the funds in her own bank account and in her local currency. As of December 31, 2016, Direct Checkout was available in 36 countries and 12 currencies, compared to 22 countries and 10 currencies as of December 31, 2015. During 2016, 45.5% of active sellers used Direct Checkout.


• | Promoted Listings. Promoted Listings enables Etsy sellers to pay a cost-per-click based fee to feature and promote their goods in search results generated by Etsy buyers on our platform. This service allows Etsy sellers to target Etsy buyers who are specifically searching for goods similar to those she offers for sale. During 2016, 15.9% of active sellers used Promoted Listings.


• | Shipping Labels. Shipping Labels allows Etsy sellers to purchase United States Postal Service, FedEx and Canada Post shipping labels through our platform with the appropriate amount of postage. The ability to print shipping labels at home reduces the cost and time it takes Etsy sellers to ship goods to Etsy buyers globally. During 2016, 26.3% of active sellers in the United States and Canada used Shipping Labels.


• | Pattern by Etsy. With Pattern, Etsy sellers can create their own custom websites in minutes through our platform. Pattern imports listings and content from Etsy shops, syncs inventory and orders and utilizes our Direct Checkout and Shipping Label services. Since launching the service in April 2016, we have continued to introduce new features and enhancements, including additional layouts and themes, new search and image display options, guest checkout functionality and the ability for Pattern users to host a blog or send newsletters. Since the launch, 2.5% of active sellers used Pattern (includes eight months of paid seller activity).


Use of Seller Services in 2016

7


• | Seller Tools. In addition to our paid Seller Services, we provide a wide range of tools and features to support Etsy sellers run the administrative side of their businesses, including marketing and taxes. For example, our Google Shopping tool, which is complementary to our Promoted Listings service and the Google advertising we do on behalf of Etsy sellers, enables Etsy sellers to reach a broader audience by advertising their listings in Google search results. Through our partnership with Intuit, Etsy sellers in the United States and United Kingdom can simplify their accounting and bookkeeping by seamlessly exporting their Etsy.com sales and expenses to QuickBooks Self-Employed. To easily monitor orders and track sales and analyze visits and listings, Etsy sellers can use our online dashboard. Etsy sellers can also access analytics on the dashboard, on our website or on our “Sell on Etsy” mobile app. Of our 2016 active sellers, 50.6% used the Sell on Etsy mobile app in 2016. In early 2017, we launched Shop Manager which will serve as a centralized hub for Etsy sellers to track orders, manage inventory, view metrics and statistics and have conversations with their customers across all of their Etsy shops. This tool makes it easier for creative entrepreneurs to run multi-channel businesses on Etsy and moves us closer to our long-term goal of supporting Etsy sellers wherever they choose to pursue commerce.


• | Education. We provide extensive educational resources to teach Etsy sellers how to start, manage and scale their businesses on our platform, including blog posts, video tutorials, the Etsy Seller Handbook (available on Etsy.com), Etsy.com online forums and insights from Etsy.com support teams. In addition to our own educational resources, Etsy sellers connect through self-organized Etsy Teams to build supportive personal relationships with other Etsy Sellers, collaborate, educate and support each other as they build their independent creative businesses.

Our Technology 
Our widely respected engineering team has built a sophisticated platform that enables millions of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to smoothly transact across borders, languages and devices. Our team is at the forefront of the software engineering practice of continuous deployment. We update the code that runs the Etsy website as often as every 20 minutes, and deploy code to various systems as often as 70 times per day. To enhance the performance of our platform, we collect and analyze a large volume of data. For example, we currently capture more than one billion user-generated events every day to produce personalized recommendations, improve our search experience and utilize A/B test features on our site.
Our use of machine learning algorithms creates an engaging shopping experience and also helps Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers connect across our platform. We apply proprietary machine learning to the search and discovery process, enabling shoppers to more easily browse, filter for and buy that perfect item, even when they may not have something specific in mind. 
Machine translation and machine learning also play an important role in making it easy for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to connect even if they don’t speak the same language. We translate listings within our Etsy.com market into 10 languages and plan to translate listings on Etsy Studio into several key languages. Translating listings significantly increases the inventory available to non-English speaking Etsy buyers and gives Etsy sellers access to a truly global audience. We also translate conversations and reviews and, in 2016, began to apply machine translation to Promoted Listings. 
We are a mobile-first company, meaning mobile is integrated into everything that we do. In recent years, we have focused on expanding our mobile capabilities. We developed our “Sell on Etsy” mobile app to help the Etsy seller operate her shop and manage orders. Our mobile website and our “Buy on Etsy” mobile app for Etsy buyers, which we developed to keep Etsy buyers engaged wherever they are, include search, discovery, curation, personalization and social shopping features, optimized for the mobile experience. 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 64% of our visits and approximately 48% of our GMS were generated on a mobile device. This is a solid improvement compared with 2015, during which 60% of our visits and 43% of our GMS were generated on a mobile device. We are focused on continuing to narrow the gap between mobile visits and mobile GMS.
Our Passionate, Engaged and Loyal Etsy Sellers and Etsy Buyers
Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are passionate, engaged and loyal—not only to us, but to each other—building a strong community.


• | Our active sellers and active buyers remain so for multiple years. For example, 32.3% of active sellers and 42.5% of active buyers as of December 31, 2012 continued to be active sellers and active buyers through their fourth year on the platform and 31.5% of active sellers and 41.1% of active buyers as of December 31, 2013 continued to be active sellers and active buyers through their fourth year on the platform. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, 15.2% of active sellers

8

have been selling on Etsy for more than four years. Likewise, as of December 31, 2016, 17.4% of active buyers have been Etsy buyers for more than four years.

• | Repeat purchases demonstrate the loyalty of Etsy buyers. In 2016, approximately 41.0% of our active buyers made purchases on two or more days in the previous 12 months, up from 40.6% in 2015.


• | Unlike many other online commerce companies, the vast majority of visits come to Etsy from organic or direct sources. In 2016, 88% of visits came to Etsy.com from direct, organic or email sources. A visit represents activity from a unique browser or mobile app. A visit ends after 30 minutes of inactivity.


• | Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers engage with each other often. In 2016 56% of our active buyers sent or received a conversation and 67% of active sellers sent or received a conversation using our Conversations tool. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 20.1% of active sellers belong to a self-organized Etsy Team, developing supportive personal relationships with other Etsy sellers as they build their independent creative businesses. Currently, nearly 14,000 Etsy Teams have formed around the world.


• | Ensuring that buyers can find and purchase the exact items they are looking for each time they come to Etsy is an important part of fostering engagement and loyalty. In 2016, conversion rates increased across desktop, mobile web and mobile app compared to 2015, demonstrating our ability to continuously optimize the shopping experience.

The passion and loyalty demonstrated by Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers is the foundation for the continued growth and current scale of our platform. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Performance—Growth and Retention of Active Sellers and Active Buyers” for more information.

Commitment to Integrity and Transparency
Members of our community rely on us to maintain trusted markets. Our policies are designed to encourage transparency and clearly outline the rights and responsibilities of Etsy sellers, Etsy buyers, Etsy Wholesale partners and production partners participating on our platform. Most fundamentally, we require that goods listed in our markets be handmade, vintage or craft supplies. In 2017, we clarified our policies on Etsy.com to make it easier for sellers and buyers around the world to understand how we define handmade. 
Transparency within our community helps to support our trustworthiness. For example, we publish an annual Progress Report that details progress toward our ideals and shares our hopes for the years to come. We also publish an annual Transparency Report, which, among other things, describes the steps we take when items that do not meet our guidelines are listed on Etsy.com, or when listed items are alleged to infringe third party rights. In 2016, we closed 4,525 Etsy.com shops that were subject to repeat notices of intellectual property infringement and closed 263,315 Etsy.com accounts for non-IP policy violations.
We strive to give the Etsy buyer comfort that she is purchasing unique goods from a shop that adheres to certain principles. Etsy buyers have a high degree of insight into Etsy sellers’ business practices. Our policies ask Etsy sellers to be transparent about themselves, their businesses and the goods they sell. We also have dedicated teams and sophisticated tools to help enforce our policies. For example, our Integrity team uses a combination of machine learning, automated systems and community-generated flags to review items and shops that may violate our policies. Our Trust and Safety team helps to prevent and detect fraud through human review and automated tools and algorithms.We also recognize that sometimes transactions don’t go as planned. When that happens, our online Case System provides a way for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to communicate with each other to resolve disputes. 
We also establish trust by emphasizing the person behind every transaction. We deepen connections between Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers through our direct communication tools, seller stories on our website and apps and in-person events, highlighting personal relationships as a key part of the Etsy experience. For example, Etsy sellers are encouraged to share their stories to reach Etsy buyers on our platform and on social media. The trustworthiness of Etsy.com and the connections among people in our community are cornerstones of our business.

Our Strategy: The Path Ahead
Our seller-aligned business model means that we succeed when our sellers succeed. We are focused on helping sellers grow their sales within our markets and building a cohesive services platform to help them start, manage and scale their businesses.
Our Markets
The power of human connection is central to the Etsy experience and we connect creative entrepreneurs to thoughtful consumers around the world. We continue to nurture Etsy.com and are also launching Etsy Studio to better serve craft supplies sellers and to broaden our reach to craft supplies buyers around the world. We want to create the best shopping experience for Etsy buyers. Our markets strategy is to expand our overall base of buyers and drive frequency with existing buyers. We plan to accomplish this strategy through three main initiatives:

• | Raise brand awareness of Etsy.com as an everyday shopping destination: With nearly 45 million listings within Etsy.com, there are unique items available for nearly every personality, style, occasion and budget. We are investing in initiatives to shape perceptions and highlight the breadth and depth of items available. Over time, we believe that raising awareness of Etsy.com as a go-to shopping destination, not just for special occasions, will help us attract a larger audience and also encourage existing buyers to make more frequent purchases. We launched our first global brand marketing campaign, called “Difference Makes Us,” in September 2016 to showcase this positioning, and plan to increase this investment in marketing in the future. We also plan to invest in paid advertising and marketing campaigns to attract new craft supplies buyers to Etsy Studio in 2017.


• | Make enhancements that encourage purchase frequency: We want to offer an engaging way for Etsy buyers to discover and purchase Etsy sellers’ unique goods. We believe that making enhancements to personalized product recommendations for Etsy buyers and helping them to better find the exact items they are looking for are our largest near-term opportunities. We are continuing our work to augment our existing capabilities within search and recommendation on Etsy.com. We also make regular updates to our platform to improve the shopping experience and strengthen Etsy buyer trust, such as further optimizing the mobile experience and our payments platform. We recently launched multi-shop checkout on Etsy.com, which gives Etsy buyers the ability to purchase items from more than one seller in a single transaction, and we plan to introduce guest checkout in 2017. We believe that all of these improvements together will support improving conversion rates and will ultimately enable us to increase buyer frequency on Etsy.com.


• | Connect globally while continuing to scale locally: Our vision is global and local, and our platform supports Etsy buyers and Etsy sellers in nearly every country in the world. Cross-border transactions are the largest component of international GMS and we remain committed to reducing barriers such as language and currency so that sellers and buyers from different countries can easily connect and transact. We are also focused on building and deepening local Etsy communities around the world, each with its own ecosystem of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. GMS generated between a non-U.S. buyer and a non-U.S. seller both in the same country grew approximately 47% in 2016 compared with 2015, making it the fastest growing category of international GMS. We plan to continue to invest in local marketing and content and other locally relevant tools and enhancements around the world to encourage these connections.

We formerly referred to initiatives within our markets strategy as “Etsy Everyday” and “Build Local Marketplaces Globally.” The above initiatives reflect these ongoing efforts, but have been refined to better capture our evolving business opportunities.

Our Services
We continue to focus on offering high-impact services that enable Etsy sellers to start, manage and scale their businesses. We launched our first Seller Service in late 2011 and in 2016 Seller Services represented $200.9 million, 55.0% of our revenue, a 47.0% increase over 2015. Seller Services revenue growth has been driven by service launches and enhancements that have allowed Etsy sellers to address the administrative tasks associated with running a business. For example, in 2016, we increased the number of countries where Direct Checkout is available to 36 countries, up from 22 countries in 2015. We also made FedEx and expedited United States Postal Service labels available through Shipping Labels, expanded the inventory available within Promoted Listings and launched our custom website service, Pattern. We are building a cohesive suite of services and tools specifically designed to help Etsy sellers start, manage and scale their businesses:

• | Start: According to our 2016 seller survey, more than half of Etsy sellers choose our markets as the first place to start their creative business. By setting up a shop in our markets, an Etsy seller gains access to a global audience of 28.6 million active buyers looking for unique goods or craft supplies. We offer a wealth of educational resources and a variety of listing tools to make the process of starting as intuitive as possible. Additionally, our vibrant community, including our 14,000 Etsy Teams and active forums, serve as a unique source of support that new Etsy sellers can turn to for advice and encouragement when starting a creative business.


• | Manage: We want to make it easier for Etsy sellers to run their businesses so that they can devote more time to making or designing their goods. We offer a wide range of services and tools that help Etsy sellers more effectively manage their business, from payments to shipping to accounting and taxes. For example, services and tools such as Direct Checkout, Shipping Labels and our partnership with Intuit all reduce the amount of time that a seller spends on time-consuming administrative tasks.


• | Scale: We want sellers to come to Etsy not only to access our global community of 28.6 million active buyers, but also because we offer sales and marketing opportunities that help them reach their business goals. Both Pattern and Etsy Wholesale are sales channels that Etsy sellers can use to reach new audiences. Additionally, Promoted Listings and our Google Shopping tool serve as powerful marketing tools for Etsy sellers looking to raise their profile on and off Etsy.com. We will continue to build each of these offerings and look to expand our marketing offerings into a suite of marketing services and analytics tools that empower Etsy sellers to drive and measure the growth of their businesses.

In 2017, we introduced Shop Manager, which enables Etsy sellers to access many of these tools and services along with all of their Etsy shops in one convenient place. We believe that this moves us closer to our long term goal of becoming the central hub for creative entrepreneurs and supporting them wherever they choose to pursue commerce. 
Competition
We compete for the Etsy seller with both retailers and companies that sell software to small businesses. An Etsy seller can list her goods for sale with online retailers or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues and marketplaces, including through commerce channels on social networks like Facebook and Instagram. She may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers, including large national retailers, who discover her goods in our markets or otherwise. We also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses, enabling an Etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform. We are able to compete for Etsy sellers based on our brand awareness, the global scale of our markets and the breadth of our online presence, the number and engagement of Etsy buyers, our Seller Services, our seller education resources and tools, our policies and fees, our mobile apps, the strength of our community and our values.
We also compete with retailers for the attention of the Etsy buyer. An Etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer, whether large marketplaces or national retail chains or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or marketplaces. We are able to compete for Etsy buyers based on the unique goods that Etsy sellers list in our markets, our brand awareness, the person-to-person commerce experience, our reputation as trusted markets, our mobile apps, ease of payment and the availability and reliability of our platform.

Intellectual Property
Protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, primarily including trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and to a lesser extent patent laws, in the United States and abroad, and we use confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property.
While we have obtained or applied for patent protection for some of our intellectual property, we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property. We file patents and register domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and abroad. We also rely upon common law protection for certain trademarks.
Circumstances beyond our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate, and changes in legal frameworks may impact the scope, enforceability and validity of rights. In addition, the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business, our ability to compete and our operating results.
Government Regulation
As with any company operating on the internet, we are subject to a growing number of local, national and international laws and regulations. These laws are often complex, sometimes contradict other laws, and are frequently changing. Laws may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world, posing a significant challenge to our global business. For example, U.S. federal and state laws, E.U. directives and other national laws govern the processing of payments, consumer protection and the privacy of consumer information; other laws define and regulate unfair and deceptive trade practices. Still other laws dictate when and how sales or other taxes must be collected. Laws of defamation apply online and vary by country. The growing regulation of e-commerce worldwide could impose additional compliance burdens and costs on us or on Etsy sellers and could subject us to significant liability for any failure to comply. Additionally, because we operate internationally, we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the United States, including anti-money laundering, sanctions, anti-corruption and export control laws.
Emerging Growth Company Status
As of June 30, 2016, we had a public float of greater than $700 million and are therefore no longer considered an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012.
