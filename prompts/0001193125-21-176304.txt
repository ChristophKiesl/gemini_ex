 These product lines are used by the military branches such as the Navy and Air Force and various government agencies such as the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy. VDC also supplies direct view video walls into both the Command and Control and Broadcast markets 
 This portion of the Companys operations, which contributed approximately 65% of fiscal 2021 consolidated net sales, involves the design, engineering, and manufacture of digital projector display units. The Company customizes these units for specific applications, including ruggedization for military uses or size reduction due to space limitations in industrial and medical applications. Because of the Companys flexible and cost efficient manufacturing, it is able to handle low volume orders that generate higher margins. 
 This portion of the Companys operations targets niche markets where competition from major multinational electronics companies tends to be lower. The prime customers for these products include defense, security, training, and simulation areas of the United States of America (U.S.) and foreign militaries as well as the major defense contractors such as the Boeing Company, L-3 Communications Corporation, Lockheed Martin Corporation, and others. Flight simulator displays are produced to provide a full range of flight training simulations for military and commercial applications. 
 Cyber Secure Products 
 The Company acquired the AYON Cyber Security (ACS) division in March 2012. ACS was formerly known as Hetra Products and most recently as StingRay56 before becoming part of Video Display Corporation. ACS specializes in advanced TEMPEST technology, also known as Emanation Security (EMSEC), products and custom engineering solutions to include extreme environmental performance and survivability technologies (MIL-STD-810 and DO-160) in support of military forces, intelligence agencies, prime contractors and niche commercial sectors worldwide. ACS has a long history of specializing in TEMPEST technology.    In addition to its TEMPEST products and services, the business also provides various contract services to government agencies and prime contractors. Services performed include design and testing solutions for defense and niche commercial uses worldwide. ACS has an office in the U.S., a representative in Canada, and technology partners around the globe. This division represented approximately 12% of fiscal 2021 consolidated net sales. 
 CRTs and Phosphor Products 
 Since its organization in 1975, the Company has been engaged in the distribution and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) using new and recycled CRT glass bulbs, primarily in the replacement market, for use in data display screens, including computer terminal monitors, medical monitor equipment and various other data display applications and in television sets. 
 The Companys CRT manufacturing operation of new and recycled CRTs is conducted at a facility located in Lexington, Kentucky (Lexel). The Company offers CRTs from other manufacturers at this facility as well. This division represented approximately 12% of fiscal 2021 consolidated net sales. 
 The Company maintains the capability of manufacturing and remanufacturing monochrome CRTs for Flight Simulators and Medical Monitors. In addition, our Lexel operation manufactures highly specialized CRTs called a Direct-View Storage Tubes (DVSTs) for military radar applications. All CRTs manufactured by the Company pass rigorous testing and quality requirements. The Medical Monitors are tested in accordance with standards from Underwriters Laboratories. Major customers for our CRT products include GE Healthcare, Leonardo DRS, Richardson Electronics, Flight Safety and many more. 
 The Company also distributes new CRTs and other electronic tubes purchased from OEMs. The Company sells CRTs into the replacement market which sometimes takes five to seven years to develop; these purchased inventories sometimes do not sell as quickly as other inventories. Bulk CRT purchases have declined over the past few years as the Company is managing current inventory levels against the anticipated reduction in future CRT demand due to the growth of flat panel technology. 
 The Companys Lexel operation also provides a wide variety of products for the scientific community in the way of phosphor coated substrates. This is an area of potential growth for the Company as advances in the scientific community are made and the demand for phosphor coated substrates increase worldwide. These products are used in many applications including CCD imaging, RHEED/LEED view ports, Digital X-Ray Imaging, Electron Microscopy, Alpha detectors for Neutron generators, and Spectrometry to name a few. Some of our major customers for these products include Bruker, Photonis, and all the US National Laboratories.

 Other Computer Products 
 The Company acquired a small keyboard company on October 23, 2017. The Company long term plans are to use this as a platform to manufacture cyber-secure keyboards as part of the cyber security division. This division was 11% of the 2021 consolidated net sales. 
Patents and Trademarks 
 The Company holds patents with respect to certain products and services. The Company also sells products under various trademarks and trade names. The Company believes that success in its industry primarily will be dependent upon incorporating emerging technology into new product line introductions, frequent product enhancements, and customer support and service. 
Seasonal Variations in Business 
 Historically, there has not been seasonal variability in the Companys business. 
 Working Capital Practices 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has sustained losses for three of the last five years. The accumulated losses reported has resulted from a combination of lower revenues at certain divisions without a commensurate reduction of expenses. The Company has increased marketing efforts in its ruggedized displays, tempest services and small specialty displays. In addition, the Company has streamlined its operations and is focusing on increasing revenues by executing initiatives such as upgrading its sales and marketing efforts including a more user friendly website to market all the product lines it sells. The Companys working capital and liquid asset position is presented as follows: 

 | February 28,2021 | | February 29,2020 | 
Working capital | $ | 3,602 | | $ | 1,263
Liquid assets | $ | 293 | | $ | 844 

 As for significant liquidity impacting events that occurred during fiscal 2021, the Company sold a building it owned in Pennsylvania which provided $2 million in cash proceeds and also received approximately $2 million in PPP loans, of which $988 thousand has been forgiven to date. Cash proceeds resulting from the sale of the building were utilized to satisfy certain debt obligations in addition to supporting operations. The Company was able to increase revenue over the prior year and has been implementing a plan to increase revenues at all the divisions, each structured to the particular division. The fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 saw one of the legacy programs the Company traditionally serviced begin a new phase of production and provided approximately 35% of the Companys revenue. The Company has expanded its cyber security business by adding a second testing chamber and a new testing machine for testing tempest products allowing it to increase the business in cyber testing services to supplement the product side of the business. The Company is also now involved in ruggedized displays, recently bringing on engineering familiar with these products and a salesperson who specializes in these products. The Company completed the transfer of the remaining CRT operations in Florida to its Lexel Imaging facility in Lexington, KY in order to make room for the new business in its Cocoa facility. This will also reduce expenses in the CRT operation by having that business all under one roof. The Company moved the corporate accounting functions to the Cocoa, Florida location which allows the Company to become more efficient and save money on reducing redundant operations. The plan is to further reduce expenses by closing the Tucker, Georgia facility as soon as the lease expires in 2022. There is no line of credit or other financing currently in place other than the remaining PPP loans. If additional and more permanent capital is required to fund the operations of the Company, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to obtain the capital on terms favorable to the Company, if at all.
