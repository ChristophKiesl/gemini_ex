Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing, and commercializing innovative therapies that change patients’ lives for the better.  We concentrate on small-molecule therapeutics with novel mechanisms of action for the treatment of severe, life-threatening diseases with few or no approved therapies.  Our lead programs are omaveloxolone in a rare neurological disease called Friedreich’s ataxia (FA) and bardoxolone in rare forms of CKD.  Both of our lead product candidates activate the transcription factor Nrf2 to normalize mitochondrial function, restore redox balance, and resolve inflammation.  Because mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation are features of many diseases, we believe omaveloxolone, bardoxolone, and our next-generation Nrf2 activators have many potential clinical applications. We possess exclusive, worldwide rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize omaveloxolone, bardoxolone, and our next-generation Nrf2 activators, excluding certain Asian markets for bardoxolone in certain indications, which are licensed to Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. (Kyowa Kirin).   In addition, we are developing RTA 901, the lead product candidate from our Hsp90 modulator program, in neurological indications.  We are the exclusive licensee of RTA 901 and have worldwide commercial rights.
Programs in Neurological Diseases
 Omaveloxolone for Friedreich’s Ataxia
 FA is an inherited, debilitating, and degenerative neuromuscular disorder that is typically diagnosed during adolescence and can ultimately lead to premature death.  Patients with FA experience progressive loss of coordination, muscle weakness, and fatigue, which commonly progresses to motor incapacitation, wheelchair reliance, and eventually death.  Symptoms generally first occur in children, with patients requiring a wheelchair by their teens or early-20s and generally dying in their mid-30s.  FA affects approximately 5,000 children and adults in the United States and 22,000 individuals globally.  There are currently no approved therapies to treat FA.  The FDA and the European Commission (EC) have granted orphan drug designation to omaveloxolone for the treatment of FA.
 In the third quarter of 2021, we completed our pre-NDA meeting with the FDA.  The purpose of the pre-NDA meeting was to discuss the content of Reata’s planned NDA submission for approval for omaveloxolone for the treatment of patients with FA.  On November 18, 2021, the FDA granted omaveloxolone Fast Track Designation for the treatment of FA, providing eligibility for FDA programs such as Priority Review and rolling submission of the NDA, if relevant criteria are met. The FDA granted our request for a rolling submission and in January 2022, we initiated rolling submission of our NDA which is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2022.  This NDA is supported by the efficacy and safety data from MOXIe Part 1, Part 2, and MOXIe Extension studies discussed below, which we believe provide sufficient evidence of safety and efficacy to support a standard (full) approval of the NDA. 
Omaveloxolone for Other Neurological Indications
 Based on our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurological diseases, characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress, we believe omaveloxolone may be applicable to diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy, Parkinson’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy.  Consistent with this, we have observed promising activity of omaveloxolone and our other Nrf2 activators in preclinical models of many of these diseases.  We plan to pursue the development of omaveloxolone and our other Nrf2 activators for one or more of these diseases.
RTA 901 for Neurological Indications, Including Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain
 We are developing RTA 901, the lead product candidate from our Hsp90 modulator program, in neurological indications.  We have observed favorable activity of RTA 901 in a range of preclinical models of neurological disease, including models of diabetic neuropathy, neuroinflammation, and neuropathic pain.  We have completed a Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of RTA 901 administered orally, once-daily 
 7


in healthy adult volunteers.  RTA 901 was well tolerated in both single and multiple ascending dose (SAD and MAD) studies across all dose groups with no safety signals, drug discontinuations, or serious adverse events (SAEs).  Additionally, we observed an acceptable PK profile with exposures greater than required for efficacy in preclinical animal models.  We plan to initiate additional Phase 1 studies to evaluate the PK and drug-drug interaction potential of RTA 901 in the first half of 2022 and a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) in the second half of 2022.  We are the exclusive licensee of RTA 901 and have worldwide commercial rights.
 Programs in Chronic Kidney Disease
 We and our strategic collaborator are developing bardoxolone for the treatment of CKD in multiple indications, including CKD caused by Alport syndrome, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and type 1 and 2 diabetic CKD.  CKD is characterized by a progressive worsening in the rate at which the kidney filters waste products from the blood.  Declining kidney function leads to the buildup of high levels of waste products in the blood that cause the patient to suffer symptoms, such as nausea and fatigue, and develop complications including high blood pressure, anemia, weak bones, poor nutritional health, and nerve damage.
 We received a CRL from the FDA in February 2022 with respect to its review of our NDA for bardoxolone in the treatment of patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome.   The CRL indicated that the FDA cannot approve the NDA in its present form.  Based on its review, the FDA concluded that it does not believe the submitted data demonstrates that bardoxolone is effective in slowing the loss of kidney function in patients with Alport syndrome and reducing the risk of progression to kidney failure and has requested additional data to support the efficacy and safety of bardoxolone. Their conclusion was based on efficacy and safety concerns primarily set forth in the FDA’s briefing book and discussed at the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee meeting held on December 8, 2021.
 The FDA stated that the issues could be resolved by providing evidence of effectiveness that includes evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study showing a clinically relevant effect on the rate of loss of kidney function in patients with Alport syndrome or, alternatively, an effect on a clinical outcome (i.e., an endpoint that captures how patients with Alport syndrome feel, function, or survive).  In addition, the FDA stated that we would need to address whether bardoxolone has a clinically relevant effect on the QT interval and show that the demonstrated clinical benefits of bardoxolone outweigh its risks.  The FDA welcomed continued discussion on the details of a path forward.  We plan to work closely with the FDA to bring this important medicine to patients in the US.
 Bardoxolone for CKD Caused by Alport Syndrome
 Alport syndrome is a rare, genetic form of CKD caused by mutations in the genes encoding type IV collagen, which is a major structural component of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in the kidney.  Patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome experience a progressive worsening of the kidney’s capacity to filter waste products out of the blood, which can lead to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and the need for chronic dialysis treatment or a kidney transplant.  Alport syndrome affects both children and adults.  In patients with the most severe forms of the disease, approximately 50% progress to dialysis by age 25, 90% by age 40, and nearly 100% by age 60.  According to the Alport Syndrome Foundation, Alport syndrome affects approximately 30,000 to 60,000 people in the United States.  There are currently no approved therapies to treat CKD caused by Alport syndrome.
We completed the Phase 3 CARDINAL study in November 2020.  The study met its primary and key secondary endpoints at the end of Year 1, and on November 9, 2020, we announced that the Phase 3 CARDINAL study met its primary and key secondary endpoints at the end of Year 2.  Bardoxolone was generally reported to be well tolerated in this study, and the safety profile was similar to that observed in prior trials.  
 On March 1, 2021, we submitted our NDA for bardoxolone for the treatment of CKD caused by Alport syndrome to the FDA.  On April 26, 2021, the FDA accepted for filing our NDA, set the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for February 25, 2022, and stated that the FDA also planned to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application.  On December 8, 2021, the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee voted no on the question of whether the provided evidence demonstrated that bardoxolone is effective in slowing the progression of CKD in patients with Alport syndrome and that its benefits outweigh its risks.

On February 25, 2022, we received a CRL from the FDA with respect to its review of our NDA for bardoxolone in the treatment of patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome. We will continue to work with the FDA to confirm our next steps on our Alport syndrome program.
 Regarding non-U.S. regulatory applications for bardoxolone in the treatment of patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, on October 28, 2021, we submitted an MAA to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and on July 27, 2021, our strategic collaborator in CKD in Japan, Kyowa Kirin, submitted an NDA in Japan to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW).  Both applications are currently under review. The FDA and the EC have granted orphan drug designation to bardoxolone for the treatment of Alport syndrome.
 We recently received the 120-day List of Questions (LOQ) from the EMA.  We are in the process of reviewing the questions and preparing our responses.  
 Bardoxolone for Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease
 ADPKD is a rare and serious hereditary form of CKD caused by a genetic defect in PKD1 or PKD2 genes leading to the formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys and other organs.  Cyst growth can cause the kidneys to expand up to five to seven times their normal volume, leading to pain and progressive loss of kidney function.  ADPKD affects both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups and is the leading inheritable cause of kidney failure with an estimated diagnosed population of 140,000 patients in the United States.  Despite current standard of care treatment, an estimated 50% of ADPKD patients progress to ESKD and require dialysis or a kidney transplant by 60 years of age. The FDA and the EC have granted orphan drug designation to bardoxolone for the treatment of ADPKD.
 We are currently enrolling patients in FALCON, an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studying the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone in patients with ADPKD randomized one-to-one to active drug or placebo.  FALCON is enrolling patients in a broad range of ages, 18 to 70 years old, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 30 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2.  We recently filed a protocol amendment with the FDA and requested a Type A meeting to discuss the overall ADPKD development program including the recently submitted major protocol amendment.  The major protocol amendment changes include increases in the sample size from 550 to 850 patients, addition of adolescent (12 to 17 years) patients with ADPKD, removal of the off-treatment period (Week 48 – Week 52) during Year 1, change of the primary endpoint of off-treatment eGFR change from baseline at Week 52 (or 4 weeks after drug discontinuation in Year 1) to eGFR change from baseline at Week 108 (8 weeks after planned drug discontinuation at Week 100), addition of an exploratory endpoint of eGFR change from baseline at Week 112 (12 weeks after planned drug discontinuation at Week 100), and addition of a sub study with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. 
 Pursuant to the protocol amendment, patients will be treated with bardoxolone or placebo for 100 weeks followed by a twelve-week withdrawal period.  The trial will remain blinded until study completion.  All patients will be asked to return at Week 108 independent of the time of study drug discontinuation.  In November 2021 we announced a plan to increase the FALCON sample size from 550 to 700 patients.  In order to maintain statistical power, with changes being made to the primary endpoint, the sample size has been increased from 550 to 850 patients in our recently submitted protocol amendment.  The secondary endpoint is the eGFR change from baseline at Week 100.  The statistical analysis plan (SAP), detailing the proposed analyses, has also been submitted.  More than 500 patients are currently enrolled in the study. 
 Bardoxolone in Patients with CKD at Risk of Rapid Progression
 MERLIN was a proof of concept, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone in patient populations with CKD secondary to varying etiologies at risk of rapid progression.  MERLIN enrolled patients from ages 18 to 75 years old, with eGFR ≥ 20 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and other risk factors for rapid progression of kidney disease.  Eighty-one patients were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to either bardoxolone or placebo.  The primary endpoint was the change in eGFR from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment, and the secondary endpoint was the change in eGFR from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment by CKD etiology.  MERLIN also incorporated an exploratory efficacy endpoint of change in eGFR from baseline at off-treatment Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 to examine the time period for resolution of the acute pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of bardoxolone. 
 9


MERLIN met the primary endpoint at Week 12.  Treatment with bardoxolone resulted in a higher mean eGFR change from baseline compared to placebo, with a placebo-corrected statistically significant mean difference of 7.71 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n=81, p < 0.0001, CI: 5.18, 10.24) at Week 12.  When eGFR data were broken down by different etiologies of CKD (secondary endpoint), mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis showed results favor bardoxolone over placebo in all subgroups.  
 The change in eGFR in patients treated with bardoxolone was maximal in MERLIN at Week 8, two weeks after the last planned dose titration at Week 6.  Mean eGFR change from baseline began to decrease within three days after the planned cessation of treatment at Week 12.  A statistically significant difference in mean eGFR change from baseline was observed for the bardoxolone group compared to the placebo group through Day 14 off-treatment, with a placebo-corrected mean difference of 3.70 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p = 0.0040, CI: 1.22, 6.18).  At Day 21 off-treatment and beyond, there was no significant placebo-corrected difference between the placebo and bardoxolone groups, suggesting the acute effects of bardoxolone had resolved by Day 21 off-treatment.   Consistent with previous studies, treatment with bardoxolone at doses up to 30 mg and for up to 12 weeks was generally safe and well tolerated.
 The MERLIN data were submitted as an amendment to our NDA.  However, the FDA did not accept this amendment as a major amendment.

An In-Depth Review of Our Programs
 Foundational Biology of Our Nrf2 Activators
 Chronic, unresolved inflammation and impaired cellular metabolism are key features of many diseases.  Inflammation is an integral component of the normal immune response that occurs when cells encounter harmful stimuli, such as invading pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants.  During inflammation, cells activate inflammatory processes and complexes that increase the production of cytokines, which are proteins that recruit and activate immune cells.
 Inflammation and mitochondrial metabolism are closely associated.  The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of the cell as they produce the energy that the cell needs to function.  This energy is produced by converting fatty acids and glucose into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by a process called oxidative phosphorylation.  During inflammation, mitochondrial metabolism is temporarily reprogrammed to suppress oxidative phosphorylation.  Instead of primarily making ATP, the mitochondria divert fatty acids and glucose to increase the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. During this reprogramming, the mitochondria release reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can directly attack pathogens and amplify the production of cytokines.
 In a normal immune response, the resolution of inflammation begins after the harmful stimuli have been eliminated.  Nrf2 is a protein that plays a key role in the resolution of inflammation by regulating the expression of specific genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, redox balance, and cytokine production.  When activated, Nrf2 
 11


promotes the resolution of inflammation by restoring mitochondrial function, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting pro-inflammatory signaling.  In many chronic and genetic diseases, Nrf2 activity is suppressed, and the resolution of inflammation fails to occur or is inadequate, leading to persistent mitochondrial dysfunction, excess production of ROS, and production of cytokines.  These processes cause chronic inflammation, which can ultimately lead to tissue damage and loss of organ function.  
 
 
Inflammation and mitochondrial metabolism are closely associated. In many inflammatory diseases, mitochondrial metabolism becomes dysfunctional and is reprogrammed to suppress the production of ATP and increase the production of ROS. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Once released from the mitochondria, ROS amplify pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, and increase the production of cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, TGFβ, and IL-6. The persistent production of cytokines, impaired redox balance, and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to chronic inflammation, which can ultimately lead to fibrosis and reduced organ function. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


By binding to Keap1, omaveloxolone and bardoxolone stabilize Nrf2 and increase its activity. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that plays a key role in the resolution of inflammation by regulating the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, redox balance, and cytokine production. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Nrf2 activation normalizes mitochondrial metabolism and increases ATP production. It also increases the expression of antioxidant enzymes and systems that work together to reduce the levels of ROS and restore redox balance. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


By normalizing mitochondrial metabolism and restoring redox balance, Nrf2 inhibits pro-inflammatory signaling. In addition, Nrf2 directly suppresses the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes by inhibiting their transcription. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Omaveloxolone and bardoxolone are Nrf2 activators that selectively bind to Keap1, a protein that governs the activity of Nrf2 in response to cellular stress.  By binding to Keap1, omaveloxolone and bardoxolone stabilize Nrf2 and increase its activity.  Since mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation are features of many diseases, Nrf2 activators, such as omaveloxolone, bardoxolone, and our next-generation Nrf2 activators, may have many potential clinical applications.  Omaveloxolone and bardoxolone have been extensively studied by many investigators.  Their tissue-protective and therapeutic effects have been observed in many preclinical models and are associated with meaningful improvements in hallmarks of disease progression, such as inflammation, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis.  Our Nrf2 activators are the subject of over 400 peer-reviewed publications and have been studied in over 50 preclinical animal models in which they have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, tissue-protective, or anti-fibrotic effects in the kidney, heart, brain, liver, lungs, vasculature, fat tissue, pancreas, bone marrow, intestines, eyes, spinal cord, prostate, inner ear, and skin.
 Programs in Neurological Diseases
 We are developing omaveloxolone for the treatment of patients with FA, an inherited, debilitating, and degenerative neuromuscular disorder that is usually diagnosed during adolescence and can ultimately lead to premature death.  Because mitochondrial dysfunction is a key feature of many neuromuscular diseases, we believe 
 12


omaveloxolone may be broadly applicable to treat neurological diseases by activating Nrf2 to normalize and improve mitochondrial function and ATP production.  In January 2022, we initiated rolling submission of our NDA for omaveloxolone for the treatment of patients with FA.  We expect to complete the submission of the NDA by the end of the first quarter of 2022.  We plan to pursue the development of omaveloxolone and our other Nrf2 activators for one or more additional neurological diseases.
 We are also developing RTA 901 for the treatment of neurological diseases.  RTA 901 is a highly potent and selective C-terminal modulator of Hsp90, which has a critical role in mitochondrial function, protein folding, and inflammation.  RTA 901 has demonstrated profound efficacy in a wide range of animal models of neurological disease, including diabetic neuropathy, neuroinflammation, and neuropathic pain.  We plan to initiate a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in DPNP in the second half of 2022.
 Omaveloxolone in Patients with Friedreich’s Ataxia
 We are developing omaveloxolone for the treatment of patients with FA.  Patients with FA experience progressive loss of coordination, muscle weakness, and fatigue, which commonly progresses to motor incapacitation and wheelchair reliance.  Based on literature and proprietary research, we believe FA affects approximately 5,000 children and adults in the United States and 22,000 individuals globally.  According to data provided by IQVIA in 2020, there are approximately 4,000 projected patients diagnosed with FA in the United States.  The FDA has granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track Designations to omaveloxolone for the treatment of FA.  The EC has granted Orphan Drug Designation in Europe to omaveloxolone for the treatment of FA.
 Diagnosis of FA typically occurs by genetic testing, and approximately 75% of people in the United States with FA are diagnosed between six and 20 years of age.  Childhood-onset FA can occur as early as age five, is more common than later-onset FA, and normally involves more rapid disease progression.  Most FA patients have disease onset by approximately 13 to 15 years of age and, thereafter, have a mean duration until wheelchair use of 10 to 15 years.  The mean age of death for FA patients is 35 years.  Currently, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of FA.  Patients are usually given guidelines for certain lifestyle habits and are recommended to follow a diet that is low in iron and encouraged to take vitamins and supplements.
 Initially we plan to concentrate our commercial efforts in the United States primarily in specialty clinics comprising eight FA Collaborative Clinical Research Network Sites in FA as disclosed by the Friedreich’s Ataxia Research Alliance (FARA), 22 ataxia clinics as disclosed by the National Ataxia Foundation, 225 Muscular Dystrophy Association centers as disclosed by the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and key neurology practices based on claims data.  If approved by regulatory authorities, omaveloxolone has the potential to be the first therapy for the treatment of FA.
 Rationale for Development of Omaveloxolone in Friedreich’s Ataxia
 FA is typically caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of the frataxin gene, which encodes the mitochondrial protein frataxin.  Pathogenic repeat expansions can lead to impaired transcription and reduced frataxin expression, which can lead to mitochondrial iron overload and poor cellular iron regulation, increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, and impaired mitochondrial ATP production.  Because impaired ATP production in FA patients likely contributes to the progressive muscle weakness, decreased coordination, exercise intolerance, and fatigue observed in these patients, as well as other disease manifestations, we believe that omaveloxolone may be effective in treating this indication.
 In FA patients, mitochondrial function is correlated with measures of neurologic function.  Further, data demonstrate that Nrf2 signaling is significantly impaired in FA patients, resulting in impairment of antioxidant defense mechanisms, while silencing of frataxin gene expression has been linked to decreases in expression of Nrf2.  Additionally, omaveloxolone has been shown in vitro to restore mitochondrial activity in fibroblasts isolated from FA patients.  Accordingly, we believe that Nrf2 activation by omaveloxolone may result in a clinical benefit to FA patients.

MOXIe Part 2 Study Results
 Part 2 of our Phase 2 trial, called MOXIe (MOXIe Part 2), was an international, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized registrational study, that enrolled 103 patients with FA at 11 trial sites in the United States, Europe, and Australia.  MOXIe Part 2 is one of the largest global, interventional trials ever completed in FA.  Patients were randomized one-to-one to omaveloxolone or placebo.  MOXIe Part 2 was completed in October 2019. The primary analysis population included patients without pes cavus (n=82), a musculoskeletal foot deformity that may interfere with the patient’s ability to perform some components of the neurological exam used to score the primary endpoint of the study.  Safety analyses were evaluated in the all-randomized population (n=103).
 The primary endpoint for the trial was the change in the Modified Friedreich’s Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) score for omaveloxolone relative to placebo after 48 weeks of treatment.  The mFARS is a physician-assessed neurological rating scale used to measure FA disease progression.  The FDA agreed that mFARS was an acceptable primary endpoint to evaluate the effect of omaveloxolone for the treatment of patients with FA.  Omaveloxolone treatment demonstrated statistically significant evidence of efficacy for the primary endpoint of the trial, producing a placebo-corrected -2.40 point mean improvement in mFARS (n=82; p=0.014).  Patients treated with omaveloxolone experienced a mean improvement in mFARS of -1.55 points from baseline, while patients treated with placebo experienced a mean worsening in mFARS of +0.85 points from baseline.
 

Further, the observed placebo-corrected improvements in mFARS were time-dependent, increasing over the course of treatment with the largest improvement observed after 48 weeks of treatment.  
 
14



Omaveloxolone treatment also demonstrated statistically significant evidence of efficacy in mFARS at Week 48 when the pes cavus patients were included in the analysis (the all-randomized population).  In the all-randomized population, omaveloxolone treatment produced a statistically significant, placebo-corrected -1.93 point mean improvement in mFARS (n=103; p=0.034).  Omaveloxolone treatment also improved several secondary endpoints included in the trial.
 An analysis of the change in mFARS from baseline demonstrated that patients in the omaveloxolone arm performed numerically better than placebo on all subsections of the mFARS exam.  Furthermore, omaveloxolone patients in subgroups that typically have a worse prognosis and progress faster, including patients with longer GAA1 repeats, patients with cardiomyopathy, non-ambulatory patients, and younger patients, on average, experienced a larger placebo-corrected improvement in mFARS compared to the study population as a whole.
 
Additionally, all secondary endpoints either favored the omaveloxolone arm or were neutral.  Patients on omaveloxolone experienced a nominal improvement in the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) questionnaire, with all nine questions favoring the omaveloxolone arm.  On average, ADL scores for patients on omaveloxolone did not change from baseline, while placebo-treated patients worsened.  Both patient global impression of change (PGIC) and clinical global impression of change (CGIC) numerically favored omaveloxolone, and improvement in PGIC correlated with the observed improvement in mFARS.

Omaveloxolone was reported to be generally well-tolerated.  Four (8%) omaveloxolone patients and two (4%) placebo patients discontinued trial drug due to an AE.  The reported AEs were generally mild to moderate in intensity, and the most common AEs (i.e., reported in > 10% of omaveloxolone-treated patients) observed more frequently (>5% difference) in omaveloxolone compared to placebo were headache, nausea, increased aminotransferases, fatigue, abdominal pain, diarrhea, oropharyngeal pain, muscle spasms, back pain, and decreased appetite.  Increases in aminotransferases are a pharmacological effect of omaveloxolone, which increases production of aminotransferases in vitro, which we believe are related to restoration of mitochondrial function.  In MOXIe Part 2, the aminotransferase increases were associated with improvements (reductions) in total bilirubin and were not associated with any evidence of liver injury.  
 In MOXIe Part 2, the overall rate of SAEs was low, with five patients in the omaveloxolone group and three patients in the placebo group reporting SAEs. No new safety signals were identified, and the reported SAEs were sporadic and generally expected in FA patients.  In the patients who reported SAEs while receiving omaveloxolone, none led to discontinuation.  Atrial fibrillation was balanced and reported in one omaveloxolone and one placebo patient.  One omaveloxolone patient reported anemia which was considered unrelated to omaveloxolone.  One omaveloxolone patient reported multiple SAEs, including viral upper respiratory tract infection and laryngitis, along with palpitations, non-cardiac chest pain, and sinus tachycardia.  While several of this patient’s SAEs were considered possibly related to omaveloxolone, no imbalances in infection or arrhythmia AEs were observed overall in the trial.
 At a Type C meeting in August 2020, the FDA provided us guidance that, although it did not have concerns with the reliability of the mFARS primary endpoint results from MOXIe Part 2, it was not convinced that the results from MOXIe Part 2, as a single study, were sufficient to support approval.  We proposed the Baseline-Controlled Study to supplement the MOXIe Part 2 findings.
 MOXIe Extension Study
 The open-label MOXIe Extension trial is ongoing, with a total of 149 patients enrolled (57 patients from MOXIe Part 1 and 92 patients from MOXIe Part 2).  A total of 73 out of 75 (97%) patients without pes cavus who completed MOXIe Part 2 were enrolled in the MOXIe Extension, including 39 patients previously randomized to placebo (the placebo-to-omaveloxolone group) and 34 patients previously randomized to omaveloxolone (the omaveloxolone-to-omaveloxolone group).  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, not all patients had mFARS assessments performed at each time point.
Baseline-Controlled Study Results
 The Baseline-Controlled Study evaluated the efficacy of omaveloxolone treatment using a baseline-controlled analysis design in which patients serve as their own controls, and changes in mFARS during the pre-treatment period 
 16


in either MOXIe Part 1 or Part 2 are compared to changes in mFARS during the treatment period in the MOXIe Extension.  Efficacy was assessed by comparing the annualized rate of change in mFARS during the pre-treatment period to the annualized rate of change in mFARS during the treatment period for patients who received approximately 48 weeks of omaveloxolone in the MOXIe Extension (the paired difference).  The primary analysis population included MOXIe Part 1 patients and Part 2 patients randomized to placebo without pes cavus who had an mFARS assessment at Week 48 of the MOXIe Extension.  The Baseline-Controlled Study demonstrated a statistically significant -3.76 point improvement (p=0.0022) for the primary endpoint of the paired difference in annualized mFARS slopes between the treatment and pre-treatment periods in the primary analysis population.  
 These results were provided to the FDA, and after an internal review, the FDA concluded that it did not believe the results strengthened the results of MOXIe Part 2.  The FDA suggested an additional exploratory analysis to evaluate whether omaveloxolone treatment has an effect on disease course using patients randomized to placebo during MOXIe Part 2 who then went on study drug in the MOXIe Extension.  We refer to the additional analysis as the Delayed-Start Analysis. 
 Delayed-Start Analysis Results
 The intent of the post-hoc Delayed-Start Analysis is to evaluate whether omaveloxolone has a persistent effect on FA disease course.  Conceptually, this analysis evaluates whether the treatment effect that was observed in the placebo-controlled MOXIe Part 2 study is maintained in the MOXIe Extension study when all patients are receiving omaveloxolone.  If the treatment effect is maintained between those originally randomized to placebo (the placebo-to-omaveloxolone group) versus those originally randomized to omaveloxolone (the omaveloxolone-to-omaveloxolone group), then it demonstrates evidence of a persistent effect on the course of the disease.  If the treatment effect is not maintained, and the patients originally randomized to placebo are able to achieve the same absolute response and “catch up” to the patients initially randomized to omaveloxolone, the results are consistent with a symptomatic treatment that does not affect the underlying course of the disease. 
 Two timepoints were used in the analysis.  The first timepoint was at Week 48, the final week of treatment in the placebo-controlled MOXIe Part 2 study.  The second timepoint was at Week 72 of the open-label MOXIe Extension in which all patients received omaveloxolone.  A non-inferiority test was used to evaluate if the difference in mFARS between groups observed at the first timepoint was maintained or non-inferior at the second timepoint.  The analysis methods, including the specified non-inferiority margin, were based on literature (Liu-Seifert, 2015a, 2015b).  A decrease in mFARS (i.e., negative change from baseline) shows improvement.  When comparing treatment groups using this methodology, maintaining a negative difference between treatment groups in mFARS is evidence of a persistent treatment effect.   
 February 2021 Data Cut-Off (Used in Pre-NDA Briefing Documents)
 The Delayed-Start Analysis used in Pre-NDA briefing documents submitted to the FDA was performed using data as of February 2021.  In this analysis, 50 out of 73 patients from MOXIe Part 2 without pes cavus who enrolled into MOXIe Extension had at least 72 weeks of exposure in MOXIe Extension. 
 The analysis demonstrated that the between-group difference in mFARS observed at the end of the placebo-controlled MOXIe Part 2 period (LS mean difference = -2.26 ± 1.03) was preserved at MOXIe Extension Week 72 in the delayed-start period (LS mean difference = -3.37 ± 1.51). Consistent with a persistent treatment effect on disease, the upper limit of the 90% CI for the difference estimate was less than zero (-0.362), meeting the threshold for demonstrating significant evidence of non-inferiority.

In MOXIe Extension, omaveloxolone-treated patients have been progressing at a rate that is >75% less than the approximately two points per year that patients progressed in a recent large natural history study (Patel, 2016).

 Many of the visits at Week 48 and Week 72 of the MOXIe extension were scheduled during the initial peak of COVID-19 cases during Spring to Fall 2020. The mFARS assessment must be conducted in the clinic, and many in-clinic visits did not occur due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions and site closures during this period.  Apart from the data at MOXIe Extension Week 48, parallel trajectories were seen in LS Mean mFARS change from baseline between the placebo-to-omaveloxolone group and the omaveloxolone-to-omaveloxolone group in MOXIe Extension.
 August 2021 Data Cut-Off (Used in Clinical Modules of NDA Submission)
 The Delayed-Start Analysis used in clinical modules in our initial NDA rolling submission for omaveloxolone was updated as of August 2021.  In this updated analysis 58 of 73 patients from MOXIe Part 2 without pes cavus who 
 18


enrolled into MOXIe Extension had at least 72 weeks of exposure in MOXIe Extension, and 28 of these patients had at least 120 weeks of exposure in the Moxie Extension.
Results of this analysis demonstrated that the between-group difference in mFARS observed at the end of the placebo-controlled MOXIe Part 2 period (least squares mean difference = -2.25 ± 1.07) was preserved at MOXIe Extension Week 72 in the delayed-start period (LS mean difference = -3.51 ± 1.45).  Consistent with a persistent treatment effect on disease, the upper limit of the 90% CI for the difference estimate was less than zero (-0.615), meeting the threshold for demonstrating significant evidence of non-inferiority.

 Change from Baseline in mFARS (Patients without Pes Cavus)

Many of the visits at Week 48 and Week 72 of the MOXIe Extension were scheduled during the initial peak of COVID-19 cases during Spring to Fall 2020.  The mFARS assessment must be conducted in the clinic, and many in-clinic visits did not occur due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions and site closures during this period.  Apart from the data at MOXIe Extension Week 48, parallel trajectories were seen in LS Mean mFARS change from baseline between the placebo-to-omaveloxolone group and the omaveloxolone-to-omaveloxolone group in MOXIe Extension.
 A longitudinal analysis was also performed to calculate annualized slopes incorporating all available data from the MOXIe Extension, which showed similar mean slopes in mFARS for the placebo-to-omaveloxolone group (0.45 
 19


± 0.38 points per year) when compared to the omaveloxolone-to-omaveloxolone group (0.27 ± 0.59 points per year) with no significant difference between slopes (difference = -0.18 ± 0.67; p=0.79).  In MOXIe Extension, omaveloxolone-treated patients have been progressing at a rate that is >75% less than the approximately two points per year that patients progressed in a recent large natural history study (Patel, 2016).

 Natural History mFARS and MOXIe Extension mFARS Slope1

1A MMRM was used to fit change from baseline mFARS using all available data from MOXIe Extension through Extension Week 120 to estimate annualized slopes based on MOXIe Part 2 randomized treatment group. The slopes were calculated using a linear model with time, treatment, and the interaction of treatment and time as fixed factors.   Natural History mean change ± SE per year is based on Patel et. al. Ann. Clin. Transl. Neurol. 2016
 Overall, these results from the Delayed-Start Analysis using two different data cut off dates indicate a persistent omaveloxolone treatment effect on the disease course of FA.  Patients who received omaveloxolone during the double-blind MOXIe Part 2 had a benefit that could not be achieved by patients initially randomized to placebo who began omaveloxolone one year later in MOXIe Extension.  Notably, patients previously randomized to omaveloxolone in MOXIe Part 2 continued to show mean mFARS values that were similar to their original baseline after over three years of treatment.
 We believe that the results of the Delayed-Start Analysis provide evidence supporting the positive primary endpoint findings in MOXIe Part 2 and provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of omaveloxolone in FA. 
 Regulatory Interactions
 A Delayed-Start Analysis using data from February 2021 was provided in the Type C briefing document submitted to the FDA in the second quarter of 2021.  These results, together with a conceptual proposal for a confirmatory study to support an accelerated approval pathway, were reviewed by the FDA prior to the scheduled Type C meeting. The FDA stated that, after their preliminary review of the briefing materials, the most appropriate format for discussion was a pre-NDA meeting. They also requested that we focus the new briefing materials on applicable pre-NDA topics. 
 20


Based on the communication from the FDA, we requested a pre-NDA meeting.  In the third quarter of 2021 we completed our pre-NDA meeting with the FDA.  The purpose of the pre-NDA meeting was to discuss the content of Reata’s planned NDA submission including the nonclinical data and chemistry manufacturing controls (CMC) packages, data standard plan, and the overall content plan. 
 In the meeting, we stated that we believed that the MOXIe data, along with the Delayed-Start Analysis, would provide sufficient clinical data to support a full approval. The FDA stated that the proposed primary and supportive efficacy data appear reasonable, though the Delayed-Start Analysis was viewed as exploratory.  The FDA noted that the ability of the data to support full approval, and the adequacy of the data and the determination of which data may be supportive of efficacy, would be a matter of review.  In response to our other questions about the contents of the NDA, the FDA exercised its discretion based on the seriousness of the indication and unmet medical need, subject to review, to permit us to submit the results of certain clinical pharmacology and nonclinical studies after approval.  The additional studies include a thorough QT study with omaveloxolone, nonclinical metabolite toxicity studies, and six-month and two-year nonclinical carcinogenicity studies.  The need for a drug-drug interaction study with a moderate CYP3A inducer will be established upon review of the adequacy of our submitted physiological based PK model.
 On November 18, 2021, the FDA granted omaveloxolone Fast Track Designation for the treatment of FA, providing eligibility for FDA programs such as Priority Review and rolling submission of the NDA, if relevant criteria are met. The FDA granted our request for a rolling submission and in January 2022, we initiated rolling submission of our NDA, which included the MOXIe Extension data from the cut-off of August 2021 that had not previously been provided to the FDA.  We expect to complete the submission of the NDA by the end of the first quarter of 2022.  This NDA is supported by the efficacy and safety data from MOXIe Part 1, Part 2, and MOXIe Extension studies as noted above. 
 We are continuing to complete the regulatory procedures and submissions required prior to filing a marketing application in Europe for approval for omaveloxolone for the treatment of patients with FA.  This includes securing agreement on our Pediatric Investigation Plan this year. 
 Potential Safety Review Topics
 Below is a discussion of potential safety topics that may arise during NDA review and how we plan to respond. The safety topics of interest were closely monitored during the development program, and the findings are consistent with what would be expected based on the known pharmacological properties of omaveloxolone. This list is not comprehensive, and other matters may arise during the NDA review process.  
Aminotransferases
 Omaveloxolone treatment has been shown to increase alanine (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferases (AST) levels in the serum, and we have been able to characterize this profile in non-clinical and clinical studies to differentiate it from drug-induced hepatotoxicity.
 In MOXIe Part 2, increases in ALT, AST, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels that exceeded the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in a greater percentage of omaveloxolone-treated patients than placebo-treated patients. The increases were transient, occurred shortly after initiation of treatment, peaked approximately two to four weeks after treatment initiation, and trended downward while patients remained on the study drug. At the post-treatment visit (four weeks after stopping the study drug), aminotransferase levels generally decreased further and returned to near baseline levels. Moreover, aminotransferase increases were generally mild or moderate, and for most omaveloxolone-treated patients (68.6%), ALT and AST levels remained less than three times ULN.  Elevations in aminotransferases and GGT were not associated with elevations in total bilirubin and no cases meeting Hy’s law criteria have been reported with omaveloxolone treatment.
 We have demonstrated that omaveloxolone pharmacologically induces gene expression of aminotransferases, including ALT and AST, which reflects metabolic adaptations coordinated by Nrf2, rather than liver toxicity (Lewis, 2021; Zhang, 2006).  Genetic manipulation of Nrf2 in animal models affects the expression and serum activity of ALT and AST, and treatment with omaveloxolone analogs increases ALT and AST expression in cultured cells and in vivo 
 21


without any liver toxicity.  Additionally, omaveloxolone analogs are protective in multiple models of hepatotoxicity (e.g., acetaminophen, concanavalin A, aflatoxin, and carbon tetrachloride models).  
 Weight Changes
 Omaveloxolone treatment has been shown to reduce body weight in some patients, and we and our collaborators have been able to characterize the weight changes in nonclinical studies. 
 In MOXIe Part 2, a mean decrease of -1.35 ± 3.585 (SD) kg in weight relative to baseline was observed with omaveloxolone treatment over 48 weeks.  A similar trend of weight decrease has been observed in the patients during the Moxie Extension study.  Adolescent patients treated with omaveloxolone had mean changes in weight that were comparable to adult patients treated with placebo. Overall, there were no meaningful differences in weight loss by age, sex, geographic region, or baseline pes cavus status. In MOXIe Part 2, decreases in weight of at least 5% were observed more frequently in omaveloxolone-treated patients (34% of patients, n=17) than placebo-treated patients (19.2% of patients, n=10).  No patients discontinued treatment with omaveloxolone due to weight loss or appetite loss.  Adverse events of weight loss associated with omaveloxolone treatment were uncommon. Weight loss can be managed in clinical practice by optimizing nutrition, or if needed, temporary discontinuation of omaveloxolone.
 The observed decreases in body weight have also been previously observed with an analog of omaveloxolone. Decreases in body weight with bardoxolone were accompanied by significant reductions in waist circumference and improved glycemic control. Multiple studies in nonclinical models of diabetes and obesity have demonstrated that omaveloxolone analogs reduce fatty acid synthesis and promote fatty acid oxidation, thereby providing substrates for energy production (Shin, 2009). These effects are dependent on the presence of Nrf2 and are associated with improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, reduced body fat, preservation of muscle mass, and increased metabolism and energy expenditure (Camer, 2015; Saha, 2010; Shin, 2009). The observed decreases in body weight may therefore be explained by Nrf2-dependent changes in lipid metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and glycemic control that have been observed in animal studies with omaveloxolone and analogs.  
 Cardiovascular Safety
 Cardiovascular safety was evaluated because cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of death in patients with FA. In addition, adverse cardiovascular events were observed in a previous bardoxolone clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and Stage 4 CKD. Of note, risk factors for these events were identified and used as population selection criteria to mitigate cardiovascular risks in patients in subsequent studies. The entry criteria in omaveloxolone clinical trials were designed to mitigate potential cardiovascular risk for participants, and signals for heart failure were closely monitored during the studies. 

Adverse Events Related to Cardiovascular Safety
 In MOXIe Part 2, the number of patients reporting cardiac disorder treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) was similar for omaveloxolone-treated and placebo-treated patients. There were no omaveloxolone-treated patients reporting vascular disorder AEs compared with three placebo-treated patients. All cardiac disorder and vascular disorder AEs were mild or moderate in severity.  Overall, no meaningful difference in cardiac AEs, including cardiac failure or fluid overload events was observed between omaveloxolone-treated and placebo-treated patients.
Blood Pressure (BP)
 In MOXIe Part 2, on average, no changes from baseline in SBP or DBP were observed at Week 48 in patients randomized to omaveloxolone or placebo. The profile of blood pressure over time across other subgroups was similar to the changes described above.
Echocardiograms
 In MOXIe Part 2, treatment with omaveloxolone did not result in meaningful changes in echocardiogram parameters relative to baseline or compared with placebo-treated patients. 
 22


Electrocardiograms
 In MOXIe Part 2, treatment with omaveloxolone did not show meaningful changes in ECG parameters relative to either baseline or compared with placebo-treated patients.  
 Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)
 In MOXIe Part 2, mean (± SD) BNP was slightly higher in omaveloxolone-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients at baseline (omaveloxolone = 31.8 ± 31.43; placebo = 18.3 ± 25.43).  Small increases in BNP were observed with omaveloxolone treatment relative to placebo in MOXIe Part 2, with mean values returning to near baseline after withdrawal of drug.  Mean (± SD) change from baseline at Week 48 was 6.8 ± 30.30 in omaveloxolone-treated patients compared to 1.0 ± 19.29 in placebo-treated patients.  Overall, mean BNP values in omaveloxolone-treated patients remained below the ULN (<100 pg/ml), and only 2 (3.9%) patients had BNP values that exceeded 200 pg/mL through Week 48.  No patients reported TEAEs for BNP elevations, and there was only one patient with a TEAE of N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) increased.  In this patient, no changes to dosing were made, and the patient had a normal BNP value at the last on-treatment visit at Week 48.  There were no associated AEs of fluid overload or cardiac failure.
 In patients experiencing weight loss from liraglutide treatment and bariatric surgery we observed modest increases in BNP.  Further, BNP elevations associated with liraglutide treatment were correlated with reductions in weight and fat mass in patients (Li, 2014).  BNP regulates energy expenditure by influencing several metabolic processes, such as triglyceride lipolysis in adipocytes, fatty acid oxidation by skeletal muscle, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitochondrial respiration, which are all processes associated with Nrf2 activation (Coué, 2016; Engeli, 2012; Miyashita, 2009; Schlueter, 2014; Sengenès, 2002).  BNP overexpression is associated with protection from obesity and insulin resistance in animals fed a high-fat diet (Miyashita, 2009).  BNP levels are lower in patients with metabolic risk factors, including obesity, visceral fat, lipid profiles, metabolic syndrome, low physical activity level, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation (Zois, 2014).  
 We hypothesize that, like the modest increases observed in other forms of weight loss, the profile and magnitude of BNP increases observed with omaveloxolone treatment are due to reductions in weight and improvements in metabolic parameters.  Omaveloxolone and analogs are associated with improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, reduced body fat, preservation of muscle mass, and increased metabolism and energy expenditure (Camer, 2015; Saha, 2010a; Shin, 2009; Uruno, 2013). A high-fat-diet study in mice using omaveloxolone analogs demonstrated that decreased body weight gain caused by treatment with an omaveloxolone analog is associated with significantly increased cardiac BNP mRNA levels, along with protection from high‑fat diet-induced cardiac hypertrophy.
 Lipids
 In MOXIe Part 2, omaveloxolone-treated patients had a higher incidence of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol values above the ULN.  Patients treated with omaveloxolone showed increases in LDL cholesterol of approximately 20 mg/dL at Week 48 that returned to baseline after withdrawal of drug, while values for placebo-treated patients did not change notably. The mean LDL cholesterol values were below 120 mg/dL at all time points for omaveloxolone-treated patients.  Eight (19.0%) omaveloxolone-treated patients and 4 (9.1%) placebo-treated patients had increases in LDL cholesterol above the normal range while receiving treatment, indicating that increases in LDL cholesterol above the normal range occurred more frequently in omaveloxolone-treated patients. Omaveloxolone-treated adolescent patients showed smaller increases in LDL cholesterol at Week 48 than omaveloxolone-treated adult patients.  No notable change in mean very LDL cholesterol was seen over the treatment period in omaveloxolone-treated patients, nor was there a difference compared with placebo-treated patients.  
 On average, patients treated with omaveloxolone showed a reduction in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol of -5.43 mg/dL at Week 48 and a reduction of -2.5 mg/dL after the four-week off-treatment period.  Changes in HDL cholesterol below or above the normal range did not occur more frequently in omaveloxolone-treated patients.
 23


The effects of omaveloxolone and analogs on serum lipids have been investigated in nonclinical models and are associated with metabolic effects of omaveloxolone, including mobilization and metabolism of stored lipids resulting in decreased adiposity, increased mitochondrial function, and increased energy production. For example, treatment with an omaveloxolone analog in a mouse model of high-fat diet-induced obesity resulted in reduced body and adipose mass and decreased hepatic lipid accumulation, coupled with increases in energy expenditure. However, these mice also had minor increases in serum total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol. All of these changes were attenuated in Nrf2-null mice, suggesting that the broad effects on lipid homeostasis associated with treatment were due to activation of Nrf2 (Shin, 2009). Furthermore, in a mouse model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a 3-week treatment with omaveloxolone decreased hepatic fat deposition, hepatocellular ballooning, inflammatory cell infiltration, and collagen deposition, along with improved glucose control and decreases in liver and serum triglycerides. These changes were associated with small but significant increases in LDL cholesterol with omaveloxolone treatment (Reisman, 2020). Collectively, these nonclinical results suggest that elevations in serum lipid parameters can occur despite overall improvement in lipid homeostasis and are related to activation of Nrf2.
 Infections and Infestations
 Infections and infestations were prespecified and evaluated because the anti-inflammatory effects associated with Nrf2 activation could possibly lead to a decreased immune response.  
 In MOXIe Part 2, the number of patients with infections and infestation TEAE were balanced between omaveloxolone-treated patients and placebo-treated patients. None of the AEs were considered severe, and there was only 1 patient reporting two SAEs in the omaveloxolone group. The number of infection-related AEs was also similar across omaveloxolone and placebo groups in adolescent patients.  Furthermore, no meaningful differences in immune cell (eg, white blood cell, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils) counts were seen between omaveloxolone- and placebo-treated patients.
Omaveloxolone for Other Neurological Indications
 Omaveloxolone is a promising platform molecule.  Because mitochondrial dysfunction is a key feature of many neurological and neuromuscular diseases, we believe omaveloxolone may be broadly applicable to treat such diseases by activating Nrf2 to normalize and improve mitochondrial function and ATP production. 
 Based on our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurological diseases, characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress, we believe omaveloxolone may be applicable to diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy, Parkinson’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington’s disease, ALS, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy.  Consistent with this, we have observed promising activity of omaveloxolone and our other Nrf2 activators in preclinical models of many of these diseases. 
 Our Nrf2 activators reduced seizure frequency in refractory, progressive epilepsy models and restored mitochondrial function in patient biopsy samples and preclinical models of FA, ALS, familial and sporadic Parkinson’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia.  In clinical trials, improvements in neuromuscular function have been observed in FA patients treated with omaveloxolone as assessed by mFARS, and improvements in mitochondrial function, as measured by reductions in blood lactate and heart rate, have been observed in patients with primary mitochondrial disease.  Accordingly, we believe that omaveloxolone has the potential to treat a number of neurological and neuromuscular diseases that currently have few or no effective therapies, and we plan to pursue the development of omaveloxolone and our other Nrf2 activators for one or more of these diseases.
 RTA 901 in Neurological Diseases
 RTA 901 is the lead product candidate from our Hsp90 modulator program, which includes highly potent and selective C-terminal modulators of Hsp90.  We have observed favorable activity of RTA 901 in a range of preclinical models of neurological disease, including models of diabetic neuropathy, neuroinflammation, and neuropathic pain. 
 Historically, other companies have explored N-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors for cancer therapeutics; however, this approach has been associated with multiple adverse effects including peripheral neuropathy and ocular toxicity.  Binding at the C-terminus of Hsp90 leads to increased transcription of Hsp70, a cytoprotective and molecular 
 24


chaperone gene, which facilitates cell survival in response to stress without the deleterious activities of N-terminal inhibition.
 
In preclinical rodent disease models, we observed that RTA 901 administered orally once-daily rescued existing nerve function, restored thermal and mechanical sensitivity, and improved nerve conductance velocity and mitochondrial function.  These effects are dose-dependent, reversible, and HSP70-dependent.
 We completed a Phase 1 SAD/MAD trial of oral, once-daily RTA 901 in healthy adult volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile.  The PK was approximately dose-proportional up to the highest doses evaluated with a half-life ranging from two to nine hours.  Human exposures easily exceeded the exposures necessary for efficacy in multiple animal models.  No safety or tolerability concerns were reported.  We plan to initiate additional Phase 1 studies to evaluate the PK and drug-drug interaction potential of RTA 901 in the first half of 2022 and a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in DPNP in the second half of 2022.
 There are about four million patients with moderate to severe DPNP in the United States, and about two million adult patients diagnosed with DPNP seek treatment annually. 
 We are the exclusive licensee of RTA 901 and have worldwide commercial rights.
 Programs in Chronic Kidney Disease
 We and our strategic collaborator are developing bardoxolone for the treatment of CKD in multiple indications, including CKD caused by Alport syndrome, ADPKD, and type 1 and 2 diabetic CKD.  We received a CRL from the FDA in February 2022 with respect to its review of our NDA for bardoxolone in the treatment of patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome.  We will continue to work with the FDA to confirm our next steps on our Alport syndrome program. Kyowa Kirin, our strategic collaborator in CKD, is currently conducting its registrational AYAME trial of bardoxolone in diabetic (types 1 and 2) CKD in Japan.  Kyowa Kirin expects last patient out in the second half of 2022.
 CKD is characterized by a progressive worsening in the rate at which the kidney filters waste products from the blood, called the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  eGFR is an estimate of GFR that nephrologists use to track the decline in kidney function and progression of CKD.  When GFR gets too low, patients develop ESKD and require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.  Declining kidney function leads to the buildup of high levels of waste products in the blood that causes the patient to suffer symptoms, such as nausea and fatigue, and to develop complications including high blood pressure, anemia, weak bones, poor nutritional health, and nerve damage.  Normal individuals have an eGFR of approximately 120 mL/min/1.73 m2.  When eGFR declines to approximately 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or below, patients generally develop ESKD and require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. 
 25


Dialysis leads to a reduced quality of life, and most patients must spend several hours at a dialysis clinic, three times a week, for the remainder of their lives.  These patients may suffer side effects due to dialysis.  Dialysis also increases the likelihood of serious and life-threatening complications, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD).  The five-year survival rate for hemodialysis patients is approximately 45%.  As per the 2021 Annual Data Report published by the United States Renal Data System, the number of patients with ESKD in the United States has nearly doubled in the last two decades, comprising an estimated 783,000 patients as of 2019.  Approximately 30% of these patients suffer from a rare form of CKD.  In 2019, total Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) spending for all beneficiaries who had CKD was over $124 billion, of which $51 billion was spent on patients with ESKD. In 2018, the total Medicare FFS spending for all beneficiaries who had CKD was about $117 billion, representing an increase of about 6% in expenditure in 2019.
 Rationale for the Development of Bardoxolone for the Treatment of CKD
 Inflammatory processes initiated by a variety of pathogenic stimuli, including diabetes, systemic hypertension, IgA deposition, and genetic mutations, drive declining kidney function.  At the molecular level, these pathogenic stimuli activate pro-inflammatory signaling pathways that normally detect cellular damage or pathogens.  These signals induce mitochondrial dysfunction in which production of ATP is impaired in favor of production of pro-inflammatory mitochondrial ROS.  ROS production activates pro-inflammatory signaling complexes, including NF-κB, to produce TNFα, IL-6, IL-1, IFNγ, angiotensin II, and other cytokines that initiate inflammatory pathways in glomerular endothelial cells, mesangial cells, and podocytes, while also recruiting activated macrophages and other inflammatory effector cells to the renal interstitium.  At the physiological level, chronic activation of pro-inflammatory pathways in these kidney cells promotes GFR loss. 
 Bardoxolone suppresses inflammatory pathways that contribute to kidney function loss by increasing Nrf2 activity.  Nrf2 has been shown to protect the kidney in preclinical studies that are the subject of many peer-reviewed manuscripts. We believe that by promoting the Nrf2-dependent resolution of inflammation and rescue of mitochondrial dysfunction, bardoxolone treatment addresses a final common pathway of kidney function loss triggered by a variety of insults and improves kidney function by increasing the effective glomerular filtration surface area, reducing inflammation, and preventing fibrosis. 
 Bardoxolone in Patients with CKD Caused by Alport Syndrome 
 Based on the results of our Phase 3 CARDINAL clinical trial, on March 1, 2021, we submitted our NDA for bardoxolone for the treatment of CKD caused by Alport syndrome to the FDA.  On April 26, 2021, the FDA accepted for filing our NDA, set the PDUFA date for February 25, 2022, and stated that the FDA also planned to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application.  On December 8, 2021, the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee voted no on the question of whether the provided evidence demonstrated that bardoxolone is effective in slowing the progression of CKD in patients with Alport syndrome and that its benefits outweigh its risks.
 On February 25, 2022, we received a CRL from the FDA with respect to its review of our NDA for bardoxolone in the treatment of patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome.  We will continue to work with the FDA to confirm our next steps on our Alport syndrome program. 
 Regarding non-U.S. regulatory applications for bardoxolone in the treatment of patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, on October 28, 2021, we submitted an MAA to the EMA and on July 27, 2021, our strategic collaborator in CKD in Japan, Kyowa Kirin, submitted an NDA in Japan to the MHLW.  Both applications are currently under review.
 We recently received the 120-day LOQ from the EMA.  We are in the process of reviewing the questions and preparing our responses.  
 Overview of Alport Syndrome
 Alport syndrome is a rare, genetic form of CKD caused by mutations in the genes encoding type IV collagen, which is a major structural component of the GBM in the kidney.  The kidneys of patients with Alport syndrome progressively lose the capacity to filter waste products out of the blood, which can lead to ESKD and the need for 
 26


chronic dialysis treatment or a kidney transplant.  Alport syndrome affects both children and adults and can manifest as early as the first decade of life and causes average annual declines in eGFR of approximately four to five mL/min/1.73 m2.  In patients with the most severe forms of the disease, approximately 50% progress to dialysis by age 25, 90% by age 40, and nearly 100% by age 60.  There are currently no approved therapies to treat CKD caused by Alport syndrome.
 The Alport Syndrome Foundation estimates that Alport syndrome affects approximately 30,000 to 60,000 people in the United States.  According to data provided by IQVIA in 2020, there are approximately 14,000 projected patients diagnosed with Alport syndrome in all stages of CKD in the United States.  However, recent literature suggests that a large number of patients with Alport syndrome are either undiagnosed or mis-diagnosed with other forms of CKD.   
 Clinical Updates in Alport Syndrome
 On November 9, 2020, we announced that the Phase 3 CARDINAL study met its primary and key secondary endpoints at the end of Year 2.  The Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL was an international, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized registrational trial that enrolled 157 patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome at approximately 50 study sites in the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia.  Patients were randomized one-to-one   to bardoxolone or placebo.  At Week 100, in the intent to treat (ITT) population, which included eGFR values for patients who either remained on or discontinued study drug, patients treated with bardoxolone had a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in mean change from baseline in eGFR of 7.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p=0.0005).  At Week 104 (four weeks after last dose in second year of treatment), patients in the ITT population treated with bardoxolone had a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in mean change from baseline in eGFR of 4.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p=0.023). 
 Bardoxolone was generally reported to be well tolerated in this study, and the safety profile was similar to that observed in prior trials.  Eight patients (10%) receiving bardoxolone and 15 patients (19%) receiving placebo experienced a treatment-emergent SAE.  No SAEs were reported in pediatric patients treated with bardoxolone.  No fluid overload SAEs or major adverse cardiac events were reported in patients treated with bardoxolone.  The reported AEs were generally mild to moderate in severity, and the most common AEs observed more frequently in patients treated with bardoxolone compared to patients treated with placebo were muscle spasms and increases in aminotransferases, which are thought to be associated with the pharmacology of the drug.
Additionally, on November 9, 2020, we reported results from the long-term extension EAGLE study.  EAGLE is an international, multi-center, open-label, extended access trial evaluating the longer-term safety and tolerability of bardoxolone in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome who participated in the CARDINAL trial or patients with ADPKD who participated in the FALCON trial.  The change from baseline in eGFR was assessed for the 14 patients with Alport syndrome who were treated with bardoxolone for three years (two years in CARDINAL and one year in EAGLE), with four-week off-treatment periods occurring at Weeks 48 and 100.  Bardoxolone treatment resulted in a mean increase from baseline in eGFR of 11.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 at Year 1, 13.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 at Year 2, and 11.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 at Year 3.
 In February 2022, we provided the FDA with an update on results from patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome in the ongoing EAGLE trial.  Mean increases in eGFR were observed at Week 12, Week 24, and Week 48 relative to Day 0 (before treatment) in EAGLE in patients who previously received placebo and initiated treatment with bardoxolone in EAGLE. Patients who previously received bardoxolone for two years in CARDINAL experienced similar mean increases in eGFR at all timepoints.
 For the 37 patients randomized to bardoxolone in CARDINAL who completed 48 weeks in EAGLE (bardoxolone-to-bardoxolone group), bardoxolone treatment resulted in a mean change from baseline in eGFR (relative to original CARDINAL baseline) of 9.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 at Year 1, 7.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 at Year 2, and 6.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 at Year 3.  
 27


A subset of patients (n=18) completed 96 weeks of treatment in EAGLE, which amounts to approximately four years of total treatment, and had a mean ± standard error change from baseline eGFR in CARDINAL of 5.5 ± 3.5 mL/min/1.73 m2.  This sustained improvement of kidney function is notable when compared to the CARDINAL study population’s expected yearly eGFR decline of 5.1 mL/min/1.73 m2, which was calculated based on five-year historical eGFR data collected before patients entered the study.  No new safety findings have been observed in EAGLE extension study. 
 Bardoxolone in Patients with CKD Caused by Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease
 ADPKD is a rare and serious hereditary form of CKD caused by a genetic defect in PKD1 or PKD2 genes leading to the formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys and other organs.  Cyst growth can cause the kidneys to expand up to five to seven times their normal volume, leading to pain and progressive loss of kidney function.  Inflammation appears to play a role in cyst growth and is associated with disease progression in ADPKD. 
 ADPKD affects both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups and is the leading inheritable cause of kidney failure with an estimated diagnosed population of 140,000 patients and an estimated prevalent population of 400,000 patients in the United States.  Despite current standard-of-care treatment, an estimated 50% of ADPKD patients progress to ESKD and require dialysis or a kidney transplant by 60 years of age.  The only therapy currently approved for ADPKD is JYNARQUE® (tolvaptan), developed by Otsuka Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., which was approved in the United States in 2018 to slow kidney function decline in adults at risk of rapidly progressing ADPKD.
 In ADPKD, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, processes known to be suppressed by Nrf2 activation, drive cysts growth in the kidney tubules.  We have shown in preclinical cellular models that in primary and immortalized ADPKD cyst-derived cells, bardoxolone induces expression of Nrf2 target genes, reduces levels of MCP-1 (marker of inflammation), increases total cellular glutathione levels, reduces ROS levels, and improves mitochondrial function.  Bardoxolone also reduces cyst formation in a cell-based cystogenesis model.  These results suggest that activation of Nrf2 by bardoxolone may have the potential to improve the molecular features that are hallmarks of ADPKD.
 We are currently enrolling patients in FALCON, an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studying the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone in patients with ADPKD randomized one-to-one to active drug or placebo.  FALCON is enrolling patients in a broad range of ages, 18 to 70 years old, with an eGFR between 30 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2.  We recently filed a protocol amendment with the FDA and requested a Type A meeting to discuss the overall ADPKD development program including the recently submitted major protocol amendment.  The major protocol amendment changes include increases in the sample size from 550 to 850 patients, addition of adolescent (12 to 17 years) patients with ADPKD, removal of the off-treatment period (Week 48 – Week 52) during Year 1, change of the primary endpoint of off-treatment eGFR change from baseline at Week 52 (or four weeks after drug discontinuation in Year 1) to eGFR change from baseline at Week 108 (eight weeks after planned drug discontinuation at Week 100), addition of an exploratory endpoint of eGFR change from baseline at Week 112 
 28


(12 weeks after planned drug discontinuation at Week 100), and addition of a sub study with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.  
 Pursuant to the protocol amendment, patients will be treated with bardoxolone or placebo for 100 weeks followed by a twelve-week withdrawal period.  The trial will remain blinded until study completion.  All patients will be asked to return at Week 108 independent of the time of study drug discontinuation.  In November 2021, we announced a plan to increase the FALCON sample size from 550 to 700 patients.  In order to maintain power, with changes in the primary endpoint, the sample size is increased from 550 to 850 patients in our recently submitted protocol amendment.  The secondary endpoint is the eGFR change from baseline at Week 100.  The SAP, detailing the proposed analyses, has also been submitted.  More than 500 patients are currently enrolled in the study. 
 Bardoxolone in CKD Patients at Risk of Rapid Progression
 MERLIN was a proof of concept, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone in patient populations with CKD secondary to varying etiologies at risk of rapid progression.  MERLIN enrolled patients from ages 18 to 75 years old, with eGFR ≥ 20 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and other risk factors for rapid progression of kidney disease.  Eighty-one patients were enrolled and randomized one-to-one to either bardoxolone or placebo.  The primary endpoint was the change in eGFR from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment, and the secondary endpoint was the change in eGFR from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment by CKD etiology.  MERLIN also incorporated an exploratory efficacy endpoint of change in eGFR from baseline at off-treatment Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 to examine the time period for resolution of the acute PD effect of bardoxolone. 
 MERLIN met the primary endpoint at Week 12.  Treatment with bardoxolone resulted in a higher mean eGFR change from baseline compared to placebo, with a placebo-corrected statistically significant mean difference of 7.71 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n=81, p < 0.0001, CI: 5.18, 10.24) at Week 12.  When eGFR data were broken down by different etiologies of CKD, MMRM analysis results favored bardoxolone over placebo in all subgroups.  A similar magnitude of eGFR change compared to placebo was observed in patients with diabetic CKD (placebo-corrected difference: 7.51 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=33; p=0.0010), and in patients with CKD caused by various other etiologies (placebo-corrected difference: 7.61 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=28; p=0.0009).  We observed that patients with CKD at risk of rapid progression caused by hypertension also showed a nominal but not statistically significant mean change from baseline compared to placebo, with a placebo-corrected mean difference of 6.35 mL/min/1.73 m2 in eGFR (n=20; p=0.1482).
 The change in eGFR in patients treated with bardoxolone was maximal in MERLIN at Week 8, two weeks after the last planned dose titration at Week 6.  Mean eGFR change from baseline began to decrease within three days after the planned cessation of treatment at Week 12.  The maximum decrease in off-treatment eGFR change from baseline occurred 21 days after the last dose.  Overlapping confidence intervals support consistency in the change from baseline for Days 14, 21, 28, and 35 off-treatment.  A statistically significant difference in mean eGFR change from baseline was observed for the bardoxolone group compared to the placebo group through Day 14 off-treatment, with a placebo-corrected mean difference of 3.70 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p = 0.0040, CI: 1.22, 6.18).  At Day 21, off treatment and beyond, there was no significant placebo-corrected difference between the placebo and bardoxolone groups, suggesting the acute effects of bardoxolone had resolved by Day 21 off-treatment. 
 29


Consistent with previous studies, treatment with bardoxolone at doses up to 30 mg and for up to 12 weeks was generally safe and well tolerated.  Furthermore, there was no imbalance in cases of volume overload and were no cases of congestive heart failure or increases in blood pressure noted in the bardoxolone group.  There were no clinically meaningful overall trends in laboratory values or electrocardiograms, and there were no deaths in this study. 
 Four out of 81 patients had SAEs (one in the placebo group and three in the bardoxolone group), none of which were assessed as related to study treatment.  Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity.  As reported in other clinical trials with bardoxolone, muscle spasms were the most commonly reported TEAE and were equivalent in frequency between the placebo and bardoxolone groups.  Five patients in the bardoxolone group had dose de-escalations or delays in dose-escalation due to TEAEs.  No placebo patients and seven out of 39 (17.9%) bardoxolone patients discontinued study treatment before Week 12. Reasons included AEs (four patients), non-compliance with study treatment (two patients), and withdrawal by patient (one patient). 
 As observed in previous studies increases in aminotransferases were transient, asymptomatic and were not associated with any evidence of liver injury.  Increases with aminotransferases were not associated with increases in total bilirubin and no patient met Hy’s Law criteria.  Mean decreases from baseline in weight were observed in patients treated with bardoxolone.  Treatment with bardoxolone resulted in increases in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) over the course of eight weeks, plateauing through Week 12. UACR trended back towards baseline during the off-treatment period.  When adjusted for eGFR, ratios of eGFR to UACR were unchanged, suggesting that increases in UACR are attributed to the increases in eGFR observed with bardoxolone.
 The MERLIN data were submitted as an amendment to our NDA. However, the FDA did not accept this amendment as a major amendment.  
 Bardoxolone in Patients with Rare Forms of CKD
 PHOENIX was a Phase 2, open-label, multi-center trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone in patients with ADPKD, IgA nephropathy (IgAN), type 1 diabetic CKD (T1D CKD), or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) completed in 2019.  In each of these cohorts, bardoxolone treated patients experienced a statistically significant increase from baseline in mean eGFR after 12 weeks of treatment. Based on the outcome of AYAME and FALCON trials, and our discussions with the FDA regarding the bardoxolone program, we will decide 
 30


future development plans for bardoxolone in patients with additional forms of CKD including patients at risk of rapid progression.
 AYAME Trial in Diabetic CKD Conducted by Kyowa Kirin
 Upon completion of the Phase 2 TSUBAKI study, Kyowa Kirin’s clinical study of bardoxolone in patients with Stage 3 and 4 diabetic CKD in Japan, and after discussions with the PMDA, Kyowa Kirin initiated a Phase 3 outcomes trial called AYAME in patients with Stage 3 or 4 diabetic CKD in Japan.  The primary endpoint is time to onset of a ≥ 30% decrease in eGFR from baseline or ESKD.  The secondary endpoints are time to onset of a ≥ 40% decrease in eGFR from baseline or ESKD, time to onset of a ≥ 53% decrease in eGFR from baseline or ESKD, time to onset of ESKD, and change in eGFR from baseline at each evaluation time point.  Kyowa Kirin completed patient enrollment in AYAME in June 2019 and expects the last patient out in the second half of 2022.
 RTA 1700 Series
 In addition to our lead programs, we are developing a proprietary series of RORγt inhibitors for the potential treatment of a broad range of autoimmune, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases.  We conducted a Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of RTA 1701 in healthy adult volunteers.  RTA 1701 had no safety concerns, was well tolerated, and we observed an acceptable PK profile.  Plasma concentrations were achieved that are associated with efficacy in preclinical models of autoimmune disease.  Due to RTA 1701’s ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) properties and the potential for drug-drug interactions at clinically relevant concentrations, we have discontinued the development of RTA 1701 and are proceeding with the development of follow-on molecules in the 1700 series.  We remain committed to developing RORγt inhibitors for the treatment of autoimmune, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases.  We retain all rights to our RORγt inhibitors, which are not subject to any existing commercial collaborations.
 Manufacture and Supply
 We rely on multiple third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for planned commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval.  We believe there are reliable sources for all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates.  Our third-party manufacturing strategy enables us to efficiently direct financial resources to the research, development, and commercialization of product candidates rather than diverting resources to internally develop manufacturing facilities.  We source our materials (whether they are of natural or chemical origin) globally, utilizing a network of qualified, established third-party vendors.  Prior to commercialization, it is common that a product candidate’s supply chain contains single-sourced suppliers.  Second source supplier identification and implementation strategies, as well as inventory safety stock, are used to mitigate supply chain risks at the appropriate stage of product development.  As our product candidates advance through development, we expect to enter into commercial supply agreements with key suppliers and manufacturers and continue to strategically build inventory and redundancy in suppliers, as appropriate, to fulfill and secure the ongoing and planned preclinical, clinical, and, if our product candidates are approved for marketing, commercial supply needs for us and our collaborators.
Manufacturing Preparations for Omaveloxolone in Neurological Diseases
 Our manufacturing and quality teams are in place for the current stage of program development with plans to grow as needed to support future commercial supply and distribution of omaveloxolone.  We are on track for planned clinical drug supplies, with a supply chain strategy to adequately support potential future clinical and commercial demand.  We have completed registration batches for drug substance and drug product.  In addition, we believe the synthesis from regulatory starting material to drug substance can be manufactured at scale, resulting in a commercially competitive cost of goods. 
 Manufacturing Preparations for Bardoxolone in Rare CKD
 Our manufacturing and quality teams are in place for the current stage of program development with plans to grow as needed to support commercial supply and distribution of bardoxolone.  We have completed process validation 
 31


batches for drug substance and drug product.  In addition, we believe that the synthesis from regulatory starting material to drug substance can be manufactured at scale, resulting in a commercially competitive cost of goods.
 Sales and Marketing
 We are in the process of building the commercial infrastructure in the United States necessary to effectively support the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when we receive regulatory approval of such product candidates in the United States.  
 Outside of the United States, where appropriate and depending on the terms of our contractual arrangements, we plan, either alone, or with new collaboration partners, to commercialize our products.  Our strategic collaborator Kyowa Kirin has all rights to commercialize bardoxolone in its territories.  We are refining our strategy and market assessments with respect to a potential launch in the EU, and we plan to continue to evaluate market opportunities for our products in other global markets.
 Commercial infrastructure for orphan products typically consists of a targeted, specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians and personnel involved in sales management, internal sales support, marketing, patient access, and distribution.  One challenge unique to rare-disease commercialization is patient identification due to the very small and sometimes heterogeneous disease populations.  Our management team is experienced in maximizing patient identification for both clinical development and commercialization purposes in rare diseases.
 Additional capabilities important to the orphan marketplace include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, specialty pharmacies, and government accounts.  To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any of our product candidates will be approved.
 Sales and Marketing Preparations for Omaveloxolone in FA
 Commercial launch preparation will advance with regulatory progress.   Our ability to launch omaveloxolone is dependent on the successful filing and defense of an NDA and MAA and approval by the FDA and EMA, respectively.  We have hired commercial leadership and will build the teams, infrastructure, systems, and processes necessary for the launch of omaveloxolone.  This will include sales, marketing, market access, patient support, and distribution.  Additionally, we plan to expand quality and compliance functions to support commercialization.
 Sales and Marketing Preparations for Bardoxolone in Rare CKD 
 We have paused our commercial planning efforts until we have a clear regulatory path forward for bardoxolone in rare CKD.  Our ability to launch bardoxolone is dependent on the acceptance and successful defense of an NDA and MAA and approval by the FDA and EMA, respectively.  If our commercial planning efforts resume, we have plans to establish a distribution network that would enable us to deliver product across Europe with a small initial footprint.  
 Medical Affairs
 In neurological disease, we are continuing our efforts to educate physicians on the hallmarks of FA and the differentiating symptoms that discriminate patients with FA from patients with similar neurological diseases.  Our medical affairs activities in the United States for bardoxolone in our CKD program have been paused.  Our KIDneyCode™ genetic testing program has been terminated.Competition 
 The development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products is highly competitive.  Our future commercial success depends on our ability to achieve and maintain a competitive advantage.  We are aware of several 
 32


advanced drug development programs in FA for which we are developing omaveloxolone, in DPNP for which we are developing RTA 901, and in CKD for which we are developing bardoxolone.
 Omaveloxolone in Friedreich’s Ataxia
 There are currently no therapies approved for FA.  If omaveloxolone is approved for the treatment of FA, it has the potential to be the first treatment on the market for this indication, but it currently faces pipeline competition.  Pipeline competition for this orphan disease results in competition for patient recruitment as well as investigators’ time and resources.
 We are aware of only one program, vatiquinone from PTC Therapeutics Inc., in Phase 3 stage of development.  Additionally, competitor product candidates MIN-102 from Minoryx Therapeutics, MIB-626 from MetroBiotech, LLC, JOTROL (JOT-101) from Jupiter Neurosciences, Inc., and elamipretide from Stealth BioTherapeutics Corp. are in Phase 2 clinical development for FA. We are aware of only one program, CTI-1601 from Larimar Therapeutics, Inc., in Phase 1 clinical development. In addition, Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd.’s Troriluzole is in Phase 3 development for the treatment of patients with Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA).  Biohaven has expressed an intention to explore the development of Troriluzole for other ataxias, which may include FA pending the outcome of the ongoing clinical studies in SCA.  If approved and launched commercially, omaveloxolone may face competition from these product candidates.  Some of these product candidates may enter the market prior to omaveloxolone, and some of these product candidates could limit the market or level of reimbursement available for omaveloxolone if it is commercialized.
 RTA 901 in Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain
 Currently, there are four drugs and two devices that are approved for treatment of DPNP in the United States including Lyrica®, Cymbalta®, Nucynta®, an opioid, and Qutenza®, a capsaicin patch applied once every three months. IntellisTM and VantaTM by Medtronic Plc. and Senza® by Nevro Corp. are two implantable spinal cord stimulation systems approved for treatment of chronic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Tarlige® by Daiichi Sankyo Company Ltd. is a gabapentinoid that is approved for DPNP in Japan. In addition, current treatment guidelines from the American Diabetes Association and the American Academy of Neurology also recommend the off-label use of gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants.
 We are aware of multiple drugs in advanced clinical development for DPNP including Engenesis (VM202) by Helixmith Co. in Phase 3, HSK-16149 by Sichuan Haisco Pharmaceutical Co. in Phase 2/3 (China), and 16 additional programs in Phase 2 clinical trials including LX9211 by Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Inc., MEDI7352 by AstraZeneca Plc, Elismetrep (MT8554) by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (Europe), PGDN-20WS by Pure Green Pharmaceuticals, YJ-001 by Zhejiang Pharmaceutical (China), BAY2395840 by Bayer, LY3016859, LY3526318, and LY3556050 by Eli Lilly and Company, ETX-810 by Eliem Therapeutics Inc., Pirenzepine (WST-057) by WinSanTor Inc., NRD135S.E1 by Novaremed AG, NYX-2925 by Aptinyx Inc., Ricolinostat by Regenacy Pharmaceuticals, GRC 17536 by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd., and CNTX-6016 by Centrexion Therapeutics. AT-001 by Applied Therapeutics Inc. is also being investigated for DPN in a sub-study of a Phase 3 program in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy.
 Bardoxolone in CKD 
 Currently, there are no approved therapies for CKD caused by Alport syndrome, and patients are commonly treated off-label with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers (ARBs).  If bardoxolone is approved and launched commercially for patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, it may face market competition.  We are aware of at least three therapies for the treatment of Alport syndrome currently in Phase 2 of clinical development including an injectable product candidate, lademirsen (RG-012) from Sanofi S.A, atrasentan in patients with one of several forms of CKD including Alport syndrome from Chinook Therapeutics Inc., and sparsentan in pediatric patients with proteinuric glomerular diseases including Alport syndrome from Travere Therapeutics Inc. 
 Currently, there is one drug specifically approved and multiple therapies in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of patients with ADPKD.  In 2018, Otsuka Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. received approval by the FDA to 
 33


market JYNARQUE® to slow kidney function decline in adults at risk of rapidly progressing ADPKD.  We are aware of one program in Phase 3 stage of development which is Palladio Biosciences’ study of lixivaptan for treating patients with ADPKD.  Other products under clinical development for ADPKD include GLPG2737 by Galapagos NV in Phase 2, Tesevatinib by Kadmon, a Sanofi company, in Phase 2, Xrx-008 by Xortx Therapeutics Inc. in Phase 2, and AL01211 by Acelink Therapeutics in Phase 1. 
 We are also aware of multiple drugs that are either approved or in clinical development programs in Type 2 diabetic CKD (T2D CKD), hypertensive, and other forms of CKD.  These include the SGLT2 inhibitors, Jardiance® and Farxiga® developed by Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company, and by AstraZeneca, respectively which are in development for patients with CKD with and without T2D.  In April 2021, Farxiga® received FDA approval to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, ESKD, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression. AstraZeneca has not said whether any patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome were enrolled in the DAPA-CKD trial; however, the trial did enroll patients with IgAN and other forms of glomerulonephritis.  The DAPA-CKD study excluded patients with ADPKD and T1D CKD.  Farxiga® may be used to treat patients with CKD due to rare and common forms of CKD including Alport syndrome.  Additionally, Jardiance® is currently being tested in EMPA-KIDNEY, a Phase 3 trial in patients with various forms of CKD, excluding ADPKD and T1D CKD.  Results from the EMPA-KIDNEY trial are expected in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Additionally, Bayer Healthcare, in November 2021, announced the initiation of the FIONA Phase 3 study to investigate finerenone for the treatment of pediatric patients with CKD and severely increased proteinuria.  The study may enroll patients with Alport syndrome or ADPKD. Kerendia® (finerenone) received FDA approval in July 2021 to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, ESKD, cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure in adult patients with T2D CKD.
 Collaborations
 Kyowa Kirin Agreement
 In December 2009, we entered into an agreement with Kyowa Kirin, under which we provided Kyowa Kirin the right to develop and commercialize bardoxolone for renal, cardiovascular, diabetes, and certain related metabolic indications in Japan, China (including Hong Kong and Macao), South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia (the Kyowa Kirin Agreement).  These indications include, among others, CKD.  Total consideration under this agreement could reach $272.0 million in upfront and milestone payments, of which we have received $85.0 million.  Additionally, Kyowa Kirin is required to pay us royalties on net sales of licensed product sold by Kyowa Kirin, its affiliates, and sublicensees in its territory ranging from the low teens to the low 20% range depending on the country of sale and the amount of annual net sales.
 Kyowa Kirin is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct all preclinical and clinical activities necessary for the commercialization of licensed products in each country in the licensed territory.  Under this agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply Kyowa Kirin with clinical supply of licensed product required for Kyowa Kirin’s development in the licensed territory, and we are obligated to negotiate and execute commercial supply agreements with Kyowa Kirin.  Also, Kyowa Kirin has allowed us to conduct clinical activities in certain rare forms of kidney disease in Japan and has reimbursed us the majority of the costs for CARDINAL in Japan and is assuming some of the costs of patients in Japan for the FALCON trial. In addition, Kyowa Kirin is the in-country caretaker for FALCON in Japan.

The Kyowa Kirin Agreement will terminate automatically when the royalty term expires in all of Kyowa Kirin’s territory.  A royalty term expires in a country on the later of the expiration of all patents in such country or ten years after the first commercial sale in such country.  Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency or uncured material breach.  Additionally, Kyowa Kirin may terminate the agreement at will upon advance written notice.  In the event of any termination of the agreement by us for Kyowa Kirin’s uncured breach, bankruptcy, or insolvency or by Kyowa Kirin at will, Kyowa Kirin will transfer and assign to us the regulatory filings for bardoxolone and will license to us the relevant trademarks used with the products in their respective territories.
 Amended and Restated License Agreement with AbbVie 
 In September 2010, we entered into a license agreement with AbbVie (the AbbVie License Agreement), under which we provided AbbVie the exclusive right to develop and commercialize bardoxolone or other molecules for renal, metabolic, and cardiovascular indications, including CKD, in all other countries outside the United States not previously licensed to Kyowa Kirin under the Kyowa Kirin Agreement.  
 In December 2011, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AbbVie (the Collaboration Agreement) under which we provided AbbVie the right to jointly research, develop, and commercialize all second- and later-generation Nrf2 activators, including omaveloxolone, for all indications other than renal, cardiovascular, and metabolic indications. 
 In October 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with AbbVie (the Reacquisition Agreement), under which we reacquired the development, manufacturing, and commercialization rights concerning our proprietary Nrf2 activator product platform originally licensed to AbbVie under the AbbVie License Agreement and the Collaboration Agreement.  Under the Reacquisition Agreement, the AbbVie License Agreement and the Collaboration Agreement were amended, resulting in AbbVie granting its exclusive sublicenses back to us, such that we reacquired the worldwide rights to bardoxolone, excluding certain Asian countries previously licensed to Kyowa Kirin, and the worldwide rights to omaveloxolone and the second-generation activators.  In exchange for such rights, we agreed to pay AbbVie a total of $330.0 million, all of which has subsequently been paid.  In addition, AbbVie will receive an escalating, low single-digit royalty on worldwide net sales, on a product-by-product basis, of omaveloxolone and certain next-generation Nrf2 activators.  AbbVie will not receive royalties on bardoxolone sales.  By reacquiring our rights, we were relieved from our obligations under the AbbVie License Agreement and the Collaboration Agreement.
 As a result of the $330.0 million having been paid to AbbVie, the licenses granted to AbbVie and the sublicenses granted to us with respect to omaveloxolone and bardoxolone and certain next-generation Nrf2 activators have terminated, with all rights reverting to us. 
 Development and Commercialization Funding Agreement with Blackstone Life Sciences
 On June 24, 2020, we closed a Development and Commercialization Funding Agreement (the Development Agreement) with an affiliate of Blackstone Life Sciences, LLC (BXLS) that provides funding for the development and commercialization of bardoxolone for the treatment of CKD caused by Alport syndrome, ADPKD, and certain other rare CKD indications.  The Development Agreement includes a $300.0 million payment by the Blackstone affiliate in return for various percentage royalty payments on worldwide net sales of bardoxolone by Reata and its licensees, other than Kyowa Kirin.  The royalty percentage will initially be in the mid-single digits and in future years can vary between higher-mid single digit percentages to low-single digit percentages depending on various milestones, including indication approval dates, cumulative royalty payments, and cumulative net sales.  Pursuant to the Development Agreement, we have granted BXLS a security interest in substantially all of our assets.  In addition, concurrent with the Development Agreement, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with affiliates of BXLS to sell an aggregate of 340,793 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at $146.72 per share for a total of $50.0 million.

Government Regulation 
 The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries.  The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources in the ordinary course of our business, principally in our research and development expenses.  Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval may subject an applicant and sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the applicable regulatory authority to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) or other governmental entities.
United States Product Approval Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA).  Pharmaceutical products are also subject to regulation by other governmental agencies, such as, but not limited to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the EPA, and the DOJ.  The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:

• | Preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under good laboratory practice (GLPs);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (IND) application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before any human clinical trial commences;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by an institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product and conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (GCPs);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The submission to the FDA of an NDA for the applicable small molecule drug product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA acceptance, review, and approval of the NDA (including the product labeling and package insert); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMPs).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain.
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate.  Preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations regarding GLPs.  The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which includes a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy determination.  The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the studies as outlined in the IND prior to that time.  In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed.  The IND must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidates to healthy human volunteers or patients with the disease to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator.  Clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified principal investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial, and in 
 36


accordance with protocols detailing the objectives of the applicable phase of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.  Progress reports detailing the status of clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually.  Sponsors must also report in a timely manner to the FDA SAEs and unexpected AEs, any clinically important increase in the rate of serious suspected AEs over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or tests that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate.  Further, the protocol for each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB, either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted.  The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution.
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap or be combined and different studies may be initiated with the same drug candidate within the same phase of development in similar or different patient populations.  These phases generally include the following:
 Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently healthy volunteers.  In Phase 1, the product candidate is usually tested for PD and PK properties such as safety (including AEs), dosage tolerability, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.
 Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve a limited patient population to (1) preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications, (2) determine dosage tolerability and optimal dosage, and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
 Phase 3. If a product candidate is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 trials, the clinical trial program may be expanded to Phase 3 clinical trials to further evaluate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage, and safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
 Phase 4. Phase 4 clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post-market requirements or commitments.  Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval.
 The manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access.
 A pivotal trial is an adequate and well-controlled clinical trial that permits the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for labeling of the drug.  In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug.  A single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including (1) where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) in conjunction with confirmatory evidence.  The FDA may accept results from Phase 2 trials as pivotal if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust.
 The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) or committee.  This group determines whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.  A clinical trial sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate.
 37


The clinical trial process can take three to ten years or more to complete, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product.
 The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture, composition, and quality of the product candidate, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product.  The application must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment, currently approximately $3.1 million for fiscal year 2022.  The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical, or other studies. 
 Review of Application
 Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission, the FDA informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review.  This is typically 12 months from the date of submission.  The review process is often extended by the FDA as a result of submission of additional information, sometimes at the FDA’s request, during the review.  The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with CGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity.  Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with CGMPs.  The FDA will also inspect clinical trial sites for integrity of data supporting safety and efficacy.  During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the product.  If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the application without an approved REMS, if required.  A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval.  The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit, and interpretation of clinical trial data.  The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or the FDA requires additional testing or information.  The FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.  The FDA will issue either an approval of the NDA or a CRL detailing the deficiencies and information required for reconsideration of the application.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information.  Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration.  Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion.  Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial.  Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 38


The Orphan Drug Act
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.  Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA.  After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.  Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.  The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication.  During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity.  Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.  Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits (Credits) for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
 Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity in an indication, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA in what is known as a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children.  The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
 To receive the six-month pediatric market exclusivity, a sponsor would have to receive a Written Request from the FDA and conduct the requested studies in accordance with a written agreement with the FDA.  If there is no written agreement, studies would be conducted in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles, and reports submitted of those studies.  A Written Request may include studies for indications that are not currently in the labeling if the FDA determines that such information will benefit the public health.  The FDA will accept the reports upon its determination that the studies were conducted in accordance with and are responsive to the original Written Request, agreement, or commonly accepted scientific principles, as appropriate, and that the reports comply with the FDA’s filing requirements.
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration.  Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver.  The required assessment must include the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.  The FDA, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, may defer pediatric trial requirements for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations.  A deferral may be granted by the FDA if it believes that additional safety or effectiveness data in the adult population need to be collected before the pediatric studies begin.  The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current, or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.  Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA generally does not apply to a drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted with the exception of orphan-designated drugs if the drug is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that the FDA has determined is substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 The FDA is required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.  Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of 
 39


the IND for the drug candidate.  The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 Fast Track Designation, Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review 
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of NDAs.  For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition.  The key benefits of Fast Track Designation are more frequent interactions with the FDA and rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted).
 Under the Fast Track and accelerated approval programs, the FDA may approve an NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.  Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit.
 Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trial(s) submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a Priority Review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at eight months after the NDA submission.  Priority Review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition.  If criteria are not met for Priority Review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of twelve months after NDA submission.  Priority Review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Even after approval, drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuous regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product.  After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval.  There also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA.  For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with CGMP requirements.  Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented.  FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from CGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use.  Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain CGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.  Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may also result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new 
 40


safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program.  Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary product recalls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fines, untitled and warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of drug products that are placed on the market.  Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the provisions of the approved labeling.  The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) and Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA)
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to the PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors at the state level.  Under the PDMA and state law, states require the registration of manufacturers and distributors who provide pharmaceuticals in that state.  It also requires state licensing of manufacturers and distributors that ship pharmaceuticals into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state.  The PDMA and state laws impose requirements and limitations on drug sampling to ensure accountability in the distribution of samples.  The PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of these and other provisions.
 The DSCSA, signed into law on November 27, 2013, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of prescription finished pharmaceutical drug products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, identification, verification, illegitimate production notification, and other elements.  Among the requirements of this federal law, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier (i.e., serialization) in order to establish an electronic interoperable prescription product system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, and keep certain records regarding the drug product.  Further, under the DSCSA, manufacturers have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, illegitimate, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.  These requirements are being phased in over a ten-year period, and some requirements are already in effect.  The DSCSA replaced the prior drug “pedigree” requirements under the PDMA and preempts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations.  The DSCSA also establishes new requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers (3PLs).  These licensing requirements preempt states from imposing licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or otherwise encompassed by standards established by the FDA pursuant to the DSCSA.  Until the FDA promulgates regulations to address the DSCSA’s new national licensing standards for wholesalers, current state licensing requirements typically remain in effect, although the DSCSA expressly preempts those state statutes and regulations that require 3PLs to maintain wholesale drug distributor licenses. The FDA published its Proposed Rule on February 4, 2020, titled “National Standards for the Licensure of Wholesale Drug Distributors and Third-Party Logistics Providers.” When finalized, the rule establishes among other things a national licensing standard for wholesale drug distributors and 3PLs.  It is difficult to predict when FDA will publish the final rule.  Once the final rule is published, the licensing standards will take effect one year after publication for 3PLs and two years after publication for wholesale drug distributors.

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws and Regulations
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry.  These laws include, but are not limited to, anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency statutes and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item, or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs.  The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value.  The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to certain arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other.  Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for a statutory exception or safe harbor protection.  Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.  Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.  Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.  Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.  The intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PPACA) to a lower intent standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or the specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.  In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below).  Further, civil monetary penalties statutes impose penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government.  As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the United States government.  Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product.  Other pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services.  Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the PPACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.  HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements on certain types of entities relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information.  Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates—independent 
 42


contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity.  HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.  In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) annually report information to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians, physician assistants, certain types of advanced practice nurses, and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.  This information is made publicly available on a searchable website.
 Also, many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.  Some states require the posting of information relating to clinical trials.  Other states require the reporting of expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and the reporting of gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states.  Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals.  Still other states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justification of price increases.  In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.  To the extent that any of our products will be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
 In both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of any approved products will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors.  Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations.  Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs.
 Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.  Sales of our products will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third-party payors.  These third-party payors are increasingly focused on containing healthcare costs by challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.  Significant uncertainty thus exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare product candidates.  The market for our products and product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement.  The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies.  Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.
 43


Because each third-party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming, costly, and sometimes unpredictable process.  We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products.  This process could delay the market acceptance of any product and could have a negative effect on our future revenue and operating results.  We cannot be certain that our products and our product candidates will be considered cost-effective.  Because coverage and reimbursement determinations are made on a payor-by-payor basis, obtaining acceptable coverage and reimbursement from one payor does not guarantee that we will obtain similar acceptable coverage or reimbursement from another payor.  If we are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate reimbursement and payment levels for, our product candidates from third-party payors, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them.  This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and adversely affect our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
 In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly EU member states and China, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control.  In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.  The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.  For example, EU member states have options to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.  A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the total cost of a medicinal product placed on its market.  We may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products.  In addition, there may be importation of foreign products that compete with our own products, which could adversely affect our profitability.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations as we begin to commercialize our products.  In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state level that seek to reduce healthcare costs.  The Biden Administration has indicated an intent to address prescription drug pricing and recent Congressional hearings have brought increased public attention to the costs of prescription drugs.  
 Furthermore, political, economic, and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental change.  Initiatives to reduce the federal budget and debt and to reform healthcare coverage are increasing cost-containment efforts.  We anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, price controls on pharmaceuticals, limitations on rebate payments by drug manufacturers, and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system.  Any proposed or actual changes could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability.  For example, in March 2010, the PPACA was signed into law.  Among other cost containment measures, the PPACA expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, imposed a significant annual, nondeductible fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products, and enacted substantial provisions affecting compliance, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners. In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the United States healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products, or which could otherwise affect our commercial operations and ability to be profitable. For example, on September 9, 2021, the Biden administration published a wide-ranging list of policy proposals, most of which would need to be carried out by Congress, to reduce drug prices and drug payment.  The Department of Health and Human Services’(HHS) plan includes, among other reform measures, proposals to lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and disincentivizing price increases, and to support market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase price transparency. Many similar proposals, including the plans to give Medicare Part D authority to negotiate drug prices, require drug manufacturers to pay rebates on drugs whose prices increase greater than the rate of inflation, and cap out-of-pocket costs, have already been included in policy 
 44


statements and legislation currently being considered by Congress.  It is unclear to what extent these and other statutory, regulatory, and administrative initiatives will be enacted and implemented.  If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business.  Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts.  Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, price controls or patient access constraints under the Medicaid program, and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible.
 More recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax Act) was signed into law, which eliminated certain requirements of the PPACA, including the individual mandate.  On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the PPACA will remain in effect in its current form. It is possible that the PPACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is uncertain how any such challenges and the healthcare measures of the Biden administration will impact the PPACA.  There is uncertainty with respect to the impact these changes, if any, may have, and any changes likely will take time to unfold.
 In addition, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted and created measures for spending reductions by Congress.  A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs.  These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Medicare reductions will phase back in starting with a 1% reduction in effect from April 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 before increasing to the full 2% reduction.  Also, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of health care providers.  Further, former President Trump and President Biden both issued Executive Orders intended to favor government procurement from domestic manufacturers.
 Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the effect of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payor, or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures.  Such policy actions could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
 New Legislation and Regulations
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced, and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.  For example, the 21st Century Cures Act, which was enacted on December 13, 2016, contained a number of provisions related to the development of drug and biological products, including provisions intended to encourage the modernization of clinical trial design and support broader use of tools like biomarkers and methods to collect patient experience data.  While the 21st Century Cures Act is intended to make drug and biological product development less time-consuming and less costly, it does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality or quantity of evidence necessary to support approval.  In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2017 reauthorized and amended several drug provisions that were scheduled to sunset, such as the prescription drug user fee provisions, and made other changes to the FFDCA, including provisions related to development of pediatric drugs and access to generic drugs.  In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.  It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies, or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Foreign Regulation
 We are planning on seeking approval for our product candidates in Europe, Japan, and other countries.  To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy that govern, among other things, clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of our products.  
 45


Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we could commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions.  Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of other countries in which we may seek approval, the approval process varies among countries and jurisdictions and can involve different amounts of product testing and additional administrative review periods.  For example, in the EU, a sponsor must submit a clinical trial application (CTA), much like an IND, prior to the commencement of human clinical trials and receive authorization from the relevant authorities. The new EU Regulation on Clinical Trials, which became applicable on January 31, 2022, imposes additional requirements in relation to human clinical trials.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as the countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country.  The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from or be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval.  Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively affect the regulatory approval process in other countries.
 In the EU, a company may submit an MAA either under a centralized, decentralized, mutual recognition or national procedure.  The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products that (1) are derived from biotechnology processes, (2) contain a new active substance for certain specific indications, (3) are orphan medicinal products or (4) are advanced therapy medicinal products, such as gene or cell therapy medicines; and optional for certain other medicinal products for example because they involve a new active substance or are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the EMA where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the EC of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion.  The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period.  The decentralized procedure provides for approval of a new medicinal product by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the “reference” member state.  Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states.  The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application.  Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state's assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.  If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the EC, whose decision is binding on all member states. The mutual-recognition procedure enables a company to seek recognition of a marketing authorization granted in one member state in other EU member states. The national procedure allows a company to apply for a national marketing authorization in a single EU country under its national authorization procedures.
 Our clinical trial programs and research collaborations may implicate international data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU.  The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018 and governs the collections and use of personal data in the EU.  The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several obligations and restrictions concerning the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EU, data breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data, the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data, and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations.  
 United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products
 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process.  The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an initial IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of the NDA and the approval of that product candidate application.  Patent term restoration cannot, however, extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date.  In addition, only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for any patent term extension or 
 46


restoration.  In the future, we expect to apply for restoration of patent term for patents relating to each of our product candidates to add patent life beyond the current expiration date of such patents, depending on the length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FFDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA.  For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides a five-year period of exclusivity to any approved NDA for a product containing a new chemical entity (NCE), never previously approved by FDA either alone or in combination with another active moiety.  No application or an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) that references the NDA for the NCE may be submitted during the five-year exclusivity period, except that such applications may be submitted after four years if they contain a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement of the patents listed with the FDA for the innovator NDA.
 Foreign Country Data Exclusivity
 The EU also provides opportunities for additional market exclusivity.  For example, in the EU, upon receiving marketing authorization, an NCE generally receives eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity.  If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application.  During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity.
Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for our product candidates including patents claiming compositions of matter, therapeutic uses, distinct forms of specific compounds, formulations, manufacturing methods, and uses in specific indications and patient populations.  We are actively engaged in research to further develop and maintain our competitive position and may rely in part on trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and continuous technological innovation to support and enhance our competitive position.
 We seek to protect and strengthen our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technologies, inventions, and any improvements that we consider important to the development and implementation of our business and strategy.  Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our products and technologies will depend, in part, on our success in obtaining and enforcing valid patent claims.  Additionally, we may benefit from a variety of regulatory frameworks in the United States, Europe, Japan, China, and other territories that provide periods of non-patent-based exclusivity for qualifying drug products.  See “Business—Government Regulation—United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products.”
 We cannot ensure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications that may be filed by us in the future, nor can we ensure that any of our existing or subsequently granted patents will be useful in protecting our drug candidates, technological innovations, or processes.  Additionally, any existing or subsequently granted patents may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or infringed.  We cannot guarantee that our intellectual property rights or proprietary position will be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide or protect competitive advantages.  Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar products, or may be able to duplicate our technologies, business model, or strategy, without infringing our patents or otherwise using our intellectual property.
 Our patent estate (patents and patent applications owned by or exclusively licensed to Reata), on a worldwide basis, encompasses more than 900 granted patents and more than 260 pending patent applications, including more than 550 granted patents and more than 160 pending patent applications related to omaveloxolone, RTA 901, bardoxolone, and the RTA 1700 class of compounds.  More than 200 granted patents and more than 50 pending applications claim additional structural classes of Nrf2 activators, providing further protection for the franchise and a potential source of additional development candidates.  Four issued United States patents, more than ten issued foreign patents, and several pending United States and foreign patent applications contain composition of matter claims to 
 47


RTA 901 and related compounds. The RTA 1700 class of compounds is covered by more than 40 granted United States and foreign patents and several pending applications.
 Fundamental composition of matter patents and applications claiming omaveloxolone have an expiration date in 2033.  These patents and applications also contain claims to therapeutic uses of omaveloxolone.  The fundamental United States composition of matter patent claiming RTA 901, and its foreign equivalents, have an expiration date in 2033.  Our later-expiring granted patents with claims to compositions of matter for bardoxolone, including patents claiming the commercial form, have an expiration date of 2029 in the United States and 2028 elsewhere.  The patent that covers specific formulations of bardoxolone, including the commercial formulation, has an expiration date of 2030.  Other granted patents and pending patent applications relating to specific uses of bardoxolone, including the treatment of CVD and CKD, have expiration dates ranging from 2029 to 2034.  Patents and pending applications covering the RTA 1700 class of compounds, including composition of matter claims and method of use claims, have expiration dates ranging from 2031 to 2037.
 The protection afforded by any particular patent depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, scope of coverage encompassed by the granted claims, availability of extensions of patent term, availability of legal remedies in the particular territory in which the patent is granted, and success of any challenges to the patent, if asserted.  Changes in either patent laws or in the interpretation of patent laws in the United States and other countries could diminish our ability to protect our inventions and to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the enforceability of any granted patent claims or of any claims that may be granted from our patent applications.
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.  Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our products and core technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted.  We have in the past been involved in various administrative proceedings with respect to our patents and patent applications and may, as a result of our extensive portfolio, be involved in such proceedings in the future.  Additionally, in the future, we may claim that a third party infringes our intellectual property, or a third party may claim that we infringe its intellectual property or that our intellectual property is invalid or unenforceable.  In any of the administrative proceedings or in litigation, we may incur significant expenses, damages, attorneys’ fees, costs of proceedings, and experts’ fees, and management and employees may be required to spend significant time in connection with these actions.
 Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that any patent related to our product candidates may expire before any of our product candidates can be commercialized or may remain in force for only a short period of time following commercialization, thereby reducing the advantage afforded by any such patent.
 The patent positions for our most advanced programs are summarized below.
 Omaveloxolone Patent Portfolio
 Omaveloxolone is protected by three families of patents.  The first, filed in April 2009, contains composition of matter claims that encompass omaveloxolone and many related compounds.  This family includes five issued United States patents and a number of granted patents in foreign jurisdictions including Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Japan, and Mexico.  Additional United States and foreign applications from this family are pending.  The second family, filed in April 2013, is specifically focused on omaveloxolone and includes composition of matter claims and method of use claims.  The initial United States patent from this family was issued on March 31, 2015.  The issued claims include composition of matter claims to omaveloxolone without regard to morphic form, claims to several distinct morphic forms of omaveloxolone, including the form used in oral dosing formulations, and claims to various methods of therapeutic use.  A first continuation application has also issued, and a second continuation application is pending.  Foreign equivalents of the original United States application have been filed in Europe, Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, and more than 20 other territories.  The European application has granted and has been validated in multiple EPC member states.  In addition, a divisional application has also been granted in Europe.  The Japanese and Chinese applications have also granted.  A third patent family, filed by AbbVie in April 2014 and being assigned to us under the Reacquisition Agreement, claims additional morphic forms of omaveloxolone.
 48


The most relevant granted United States patents with claims covering omaveloxolone are listed below, along with their projected expiration dates.  As discussed below for bardoxolone, if omaveloxolone is approved for marketing in the United States, we may be eligible for term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act for a granted United States patent containing claims covering omaveloxolone.  Similar term extensions may be available in Europe, Japan, and certain other foreign jurisdictions.  The amount of any such term extension, and the identity of the patent to which it would apply, depend upon several factors including the duration of the development program and the date of marketing approval.  See “Government Regulation—United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products.”

RTA 901 Patent Portfolio
 RTA 901 is protected by a family of patents and applications based on the Patent Cooperation Treaty application filed in 2013.  Patents from this family have been granted in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and New Zealand.  Applications are pending in Europe, China, Mexico, and several other countries.  Patents are granted on three United States continuation applications, while a fourth United States continuation application is pending.  Patented and pending claims in this family include composition of matter claims that specifically cover RTA 901 regardless of form, and other claims that cover related compounds.  Patents from this family will expire in 2033 unless extended.  A second family of patents, filed in 2019 in more than 20 territories, provides additional composition of matter protection for RTA 901.  Patents from this family will expire in 2039 unless extended.  Details of the issued United States patent are shown below.

Bardoxolone Patent Portfolio
 Our bardoxolone patent portfolio includes seven families of granted United States patents, some with related applications pending, and three additional families of pending United States patent applications.  Granted and pending claims offer various forms of protection for bardoxolone including claims to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, specific forms (such as crystalline and non-crystalline forms), specific formulations, and methods for treating a variety of diseases, including CVD and CKD, using bardoxolone or its analogs.  These United States patents and applications, and their foreign equivalents, are described in more detail below.
 Two families of composition of matter patents contain claims that cover bardoxolone.  The original patent family containing claims to bardoxolone and related compounds was filed in 1999 and exclusively licensed to Reata in 2004 (see “Business—Intellectual Property—Licenses”).  Exclusive of any patent term extension, one granted United States 
 49


patent from this family containing claims covering bardoxolone has an expiration date in 2022.  Corresponding patents granted in Canada, Europe (validated in multiple European Patent Convention (EPC) member states), and Japan expired in 2019.  Exclusive of any patent term extension, the granted United States patents containing claims covering specific forms of bardoxolone, including the commercial form, are due to expire in 2028 or 2029.  Two corresponding regional patents have been granted in Europe and each is validated in multiple EPC member states.  Additional corresponding patents have been granted in Japan, China, Canada, and several other countries, and related applications provide broad international protection in additional territories worldwide.  Exclusive of any patent term extension, these granted foreign patents and pending patent applications, if granted, are due to expire in 2028.
 In some cases, United States patents claiming bardoxolone have longer terms than the corresponding foreign patents.  This results from the USPTO’s grant of patent term adjustments to offset examination delays originating at the USPTO.  Analogous adjustments are generally not available under foreign patent laws.  If bardoxolone is approved for marketing in the United States, under the Hatch-Waxman Act we may be eligible for up to five years patent term extension for a granted United States patent containing claims covering bardoxolone.  Unlike patent term adjustments, similar term extensions may be available in Europe, Japan, Australia, and certain other foreign jurisdictions.  The amount of any such term extension, and the identity of the patent to which it would apply, depend upon several factors including the duration of the development program and the date of marketing approval.  See “Business—Government Regulation—United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products.”
 We also own or exclusively license various United States and foreign granted patents and pending patent applications containing claims covering formulations of bardoxolone, including the planned commercial formulation, and methods of using bardoxolone for the treatment of multiple diseases including PH, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), endothelial dysfunction (an essential component of many cardiovascular disorders including PAH), CVD, CKD, Alport syndrome, metabolic disorders, and obesity.
 The most relevant granted United States patents with composition of matter or method of use claims covering bardoxolone are listed below, along with their projected expiration dates exclusive of any patent term extension.

 Trade Secrets and Know-How
 Certain aspects of our activities, such as our research and manufacturing efforts, rely in part on proprietary know-how or trade secrets.  Because we may employ third-party contractors to conduct certain aspects of those activities and because we collaborate with various organizations and academic institutions on the advancement of our technology platform, we must at times share trade secrets with them.  We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, collaborative research agreements, consulting agreements, or other similar agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees, and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information.  These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, such as trade secrets.  Despite these contractual provisions, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements.  Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor’s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.  We also seek to preserve the 
 50


integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
 Licenses
 2014 University of Kansas License
 In September 2014, we entered into two exclusive, worldwide license agreements with KU Center for Technology Commercialization, Inc., the manager of intellectual property owned by University of Kansas and the University of Kansas Medical Center (the University of Kansas), to compounds claimed in certain patents and patent applications either owned exclusively by the University of Kansas, including RTA 901, or owned jointly by the University of Kansas and the National Institutes of Health (the NIH) that act as small molecule modulators of heat shock protein activity and responses in all human and veterinary therapeutic and diagnostic uses.
 Under the terms of these licenses, we paid the University of Kansas initial licensing fees and reimbursed University of Kansas for past patent expenses incurred.  Under each agreement, we are required to pay annual license maintenance fees, are obligated to spend a specified threshold for sponsored research to be performed by the University of Kansas, and are obligated to pay University of Kansas development and regulatory milestone payments for each of the first two products and sales milestone payments only on the first product developed.  Under each agreement the University of Kansas is entitled to receive from us a portion of any sublicensing revenue we receive from sublicenses that we grant under the licensed technology at a percentage ranging from the low single digits to the low thirties depending on the stage of development at the time the sublicense is granted.  Under each agreement, the University of Kansas is entitled to receive royalties on net sales of licensed products sold by us, our affiliates, and our sublicensees at a percentage ranging in the low single digits depending on the type of licensed product, subject to minimum annual royalties.  To date, we have made $0.7 million in development and sublicense payments under these licenses.  Under each license agreement we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, and market at least one licensed compound.  Additionally, under each license agreement, the University of Kansas retains limited rights related to research and educational use of these compounds, and the United States government also retains certain limited rights related to these compounds arising from federal funding of the research that led to their discovery.  Under one agreement, the NIH retained limited rights related to research and educational use of compounds claimed in patents that name NIH as an assignee.  In July 2020, Reata voluntarily terminated the license that involved both the University of Kansas and NIH.  This license did not involve any patents that claim compounds in development by Reata or under consideration for development.  The remaining license, which exclusively involves the University of Kansas as the licensor (the KU license), includes patents that claim RTA 901 and potential back-up or follow-on compounds, and remains in full force and effect.
 The KU license is effective on a per-country basis until the later of: (i) the last expiration of a claim in a licensed patent that covers the licensed product in such country; (ii) ten years from first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country; or (iii) the expiration of any period of regulatory exclusivity for a licensed product that bars the entry of generic competitors in such country.
 The KU license can be terminated by the University of Kansas if we fail to make required payments or reports, fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize a licensed product, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, enter into receivership or a composition with creditors, or fail to perform certain other obligations including the achievement of certain developmental milestones within specified time limits, and we fail to cure any such breach within 30 days of receiving a notice of default from the licensors.
 2004 Dartmouth and MD Anderson License
 In 2004, we entered into an agreement with the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System in which we obtained from the Trustees of Dartmouth College (Dartmouth) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson), an exclusive, sublicenseable, worldwide license to compounds, including bardoxolone, and claims in certain patents and patent applications, along with associated know-how, to manufacture, have manufactured, use and sell defined licensed products for use within the field of human therapeutic and diagnostic uses, research reagents, and veterinary uses.  Dartmouth and MD Anderson retain certain limited rights related to academic research and educational use of these compounds, and the United States government retains certain limited rights.
 51


Under the terms of this license, we paid an initial licensing fee and sunk-in patent costs and are required to pay annual license maintenance fees.  In addition, the license requires us to pay certain development milestone payments depending on the licensed indication, a portion of sublicensing revenue received by us from sublicenses that we grant under the licensed technology at percentages between mid-teen digits and low-single digits, and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products by us, our affiliates, and our sublicensees subject to specified annual minimums.  To date, we have made $27.2 million in development and sublicense payments under the license.
 We have a continuing obligation to use best efforts to commercialize the licensed technology.  The license is effective until the last expiration of a claim in a licensed patent that covers the licensed product or 20 years if no licensed patent covers the licensed product.  The license can be terminated by the licensors for our material breach subject to a specified notice and cure period based on the nature of the breach, if we become insolvent or enter bankruptcy or receivership proceedings, if we fail to provide satisfactory evidence that we are exercising best efforts to commercialize a licensed invention, or if two payments are late or unpaid within a twelve-month period.  Upon any termination of the license, we grant licensors a non-exclusive, sublicenseable license to any improvements that we make to the licensed technology, including those that we license from third parties, subject to a mutually agreed royalty.
 2012 Amendment to the 2004 Dartmouth and MD Anderson License
 In July 2012, the parties executed an amendment to the 2004 license.  This amendment provides, among other terms, that we will pay to the licensors a low single-digit royalty on net sales of certain Nrf2 activator compounds covered by the Collaboration Agreement, including omaveloxolone, that are claimed in certain patents and patent applications that are wholly owned by or assigned to us as identified in the Collaboration Agreement.
 2021 Amendment to the 2004 Dartmouth and MD Anderson License
 In August 2021, the parties executed an amendment to the 2004 license.  This amendment, among other terms, provides consent to an internal restructuring by the Company of certain of its intellectual property rights, facilitates the potential monetization by Dartmouth of its rights to royalties under the 2004 license, clarifies the applicability of certain running royalty payment obligations with respect to certain compounds, and specifies the dispute resolution procedure regarding a dispute between the Company and Licensors as to whether the Company is obligated under the 2012 amendment to the 2004 license to pay licensors a low single-digit royalty on sales of products containing bardoxolone.
 2009 Dartmouth License
 In 2009, we entered into an agreement with Dartmouth, pursuant to which Dartmouth granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicenseable license to Dartmouth’s rights in patents and patent applications jointly owned by us and Dartmouth claiming the use of bardoxolone and related compounds in the treatment of renal, cardiovascular, and certain metabolic diseases, along with associated know-how, to make, have made, use and sell defined licensed products in the licensed field.  Dartmouth retains certain limited rights related to academic research and educational use of these compounds.
 Under the terms of this license, we paid to Dartmouth an initial licensing fee, and we are required to pay annual maintenance fees and payments associated with the achievement of certain development and aggregate sales milestones.  In addition, Dartmouth is entitled to receive from us a portion of our sublicensing revenue from sublicenses that we grant under the licensed technology at a percentage in the low single digits and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products by us, our affiliates, and our sublicensees.  To date, we have made $11.3 million in development and sublicense payments under the license.
 52


We are obligated to exert commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize and effectively manufacture and market licensed products, including, targeting certain development milestones specified in the agreement.
 The license is effective until the last valid claim of the licensed patents in the territory expires.  Each party has the right to terminate the license for the other party’s material breach, subject to a specified notice and cure period.  The license terminates automatically in the event that we become insolvent, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or file for bankruptcy.
 2021 Amendment to the 2009 Dartmouth License
 In August 2021, the parties executed an amendment to the 2009 license.  This amendment, among other terms, provides consent to an internal restructuring by the Company of certain of its intellectual property rights, facilitates the potential monetization by Dartmouth of its rights to royalties under the 2009 license, clarifies that there is no minimum royalty provision, and adds provisions regarding the defense of certain patent rights.
  Third-Party Filings
 United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products.  Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that, if granted, could pose an infringement risk with respect to our use of our product candidates or proprietary technologies.
 If a third party claims that we infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including but not limited to litigation expenses, substantial damages, attorney fees, injunction, royalty payments, cross-licensing of our patents, redesign of our products or processes, and related fees and costs.
 We may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our products, product candidates, and proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights.  If one of these patents were to be found to cover our products, product candidates, proprietary technologies, or their uses, we could be required to pay damages and could be restricted from commercializing our products, product candidates, or using our proprietary technologies unless we obtain a license to the patent.  A license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.  In addition, during litigation, the patent holder might obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable right, which could prohibit us from making, using or selling our products, technologies, or methods.
 Human Capital Management
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 346 full-time and three part-time employees. 67 of our employees hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, with 241 employees engaged in research and development activities.  None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and none of our employees has entered into a collective bargaining agreement with us.  We consider our overall employee relations to be good.
 Diversity and inclusion
 We are committed to creating and maintaining a diverse and inclusive work force.  We believe our company is stronger because of the variety of our employees’ experiences and backgrounds.
 COVID-19 employee safety and benefits
 When COVID-19 emerged as a global pandemic in the first quarter of, 2020, Reata was quick to respond and was an early adopter of a work-from-home policy, with the exception of the laboratory that continued to operate throughout under strict safety protocols.  For all remote employees, we provided appropriate workstation equipment as well as training and resources to support employees’ mental and emotional wellbeing.  In the second quarter of 2021, Reata relaxed its policy and permitted employees to return to the office if requested.  Although the Omicron 
 53


variant has temporarily caused us to restrict office attendance, employees have typically agreed to a modified work schedule with management with approximately 100 employees attending the office on a regular basis.  Since the onset of the pandemic, we have continued to provide full pay and benefits to employees unable to work due to illness from COVID-19, as well as those managing childcare issues or caring for ill family members. 
 Community engagement, social and relationship capital
 Although the pandemic has significantly impacted our ability to conduct in-person community activities, we have continued to support the North Texas community as much as practical.  Our two key initiatives in 2021 were teams assisting the North Texas Food Bank in packaging up food for local families in need, and employees across the organization supported the Salvation Army Angel Tree Program.  With a planned gradual return to the office in mid-2022, Reata plans to expand its volunteering program to support the local community as it recovers from the economic and social challenges created by the pandemic. 
 Compensation and benefits, health and wellness
 We strive to provide competitive compensation and benefit programs that help meet the varying needs of our employees.  Our competitive total rewards package includes market competitive salaries, performance related bonuses, and a long-term incentive program that provides all employees the opportunity to benefit from equity ownership through annual grants in Reata restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options. Given the highly competitive market we are experiencing, Reata conducts regular market assessments and in 2021 made a number of compensation adjustments to attract and retain talent. 
 Reata provides comprehensive benefit offerings, including health insurance, dental, vision, and a number of optional benefits.  Reata also offers a childcare Flexible Spending Account (FSA) and contributes into a healthcare FSA or a Health Savings Account.  Reata also offers a 401(k) plan with an employer match. In 2021, Reata expanded its family leave program to provide up to nine weeks paid leave for an expectant mother and two weeks paid leave for a father/domestic partner. 
 Growth and development
 Reata’s revised grade structure provides a foundation for career development.  Coupled with career guides, employees will be able to identify potential career paths within the organization and understand what personal development initiatives they should adopt to improve career advancement opportunities.  Reata utilizes an online performance management process that aligns employee goals with those of their respective function and the broader organization.  Tuition reimbursement is also made available to employees wishing to pursue additional qualifications.
 Communications and engagement
 We employ a variety of tools to facilitate open and direct communications across our organization.  These include open forums with executives, townhall meetings, social events, and opportunities to participate in cross-functional teams and committees.  Since the onset of the pandemic, we have adapted these forums to allow for virtual connection.  We refine our employee programs through employee engagement surveys as well as follow up pulse surveys.  The executive leadership team reviews annual survey results and ensures action plans are implemented to further increase employee engagement.
 Conduct and ethics
 Our board of directors and senior management strongly support a no-tolerance stance for workplace harassment, biases, and unethical behavior.  All employees are required to undertake annual training and abide by, review, and confirm compliance with, among other policies, our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct policy, Healthcare Compliance policies, and preventing harassment in the workplace policies.
