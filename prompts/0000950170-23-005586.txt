Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a bi-coastal contract development and manufacturing organization, or CDMO, with capabilities spanning pre-investigational new drug development to commercial manufacturing and packaging for a wide range of therapeutic dosage forms with a primary focus on small molecules. With an expertise in solving complex manufacturing problems, we are a leading CDMO providing development, end-to-end regulatory support, clinical and commercial manufacturing, aseptic fill/finish, lyophilization, packaging and logistics services to the global pharmaceutical market. In addition to our experience in handling DEA-controlled substances and developing and manufacturing modified-release dosage forms, we have the expertise to deliver on our clients’ pharmaceutical development and manufacturing projects, regardless of complexity level. We do all of this in our three state-of-the-art facilities that, in the aggregate, total 145,000 square feet, in Gainesville, Georgia and San Diego, California.
 We currently manufacture the following key products with our key commercial partners: Ritalin LA®, Focalin XR®, Verelan PM®, Verelan SR®, Verapamil PM, Verapamil SR and Donnatal liquids and tablets. We also support numerous development stage products.
 Effective March 21, 2022, our name was changed to Societal CDMO, Inc. This name change is reflective of our corporate transformation that has taken place primarily as a result of our 2021 acquisition and successful integration of IriSys, LLC, or IriSys, a San Diego-based CDMO, into the organization. Additionally, this name change creates a clear and powerful brand that describes the company’s capabilities and commitment to our people, clients, and the patients we ultimately serve. The evolution to Societal CDMO also afforded us the opportunity to create new mission and vision statements that are better aligned with our new organization. Our mission is to improve patient lives through client partnerships. Our vision is to be a premier, trusted CDMO by bringing tailored solutions to our clients while fostering engaging and rewarding careers for our people. The name change, and the new mission and vision statements each signifies our commitment as a CDMO within the industry.
 Our manufacturing and development capabilities include product development from formulation through clinical trial and commercial manufacturing, and specialized capabilities for solid oral dosage forms, with specialization in modified release technologies and facilities to handle highly potent compounds and controlled substances, liposomes and nano/microparticles, topicals and oral liquids. In September 2022, we announced a new state of the art, aseptic fill/finish and lyophilization suite in our San Diego facility to further our goal of offering end-to-end solutions to our clients. In addition to providing manufacturing capabilities, we offer our customers clinical trial support including over-encapsulation, comparator sourcing, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution. We have a bi-coastal footprint from which to better serve clients within the U.S., as well as globally. In a typical collaboration between us and our commercial partners, we continue to work with our partners to develop product candidates or new formulations of existing product candidates. We also typically exclusively manufacture and supply clinical and commercial supplies of these proprietary products and product candidates.


Our Strategy
 The CDMO market is large and growing and is expected to continue to expand as outsourced penetration is seen due to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies outsourcing more of their operations. We believe companies, which include our customers and prospective customers, generally prefer fewer, higher quality suppliers with expertise in addressing their formulation and manufacturing challenges early in the development cycle. Our strategy for growth in this market includes executing segment-specific sales and marketing strategies; building stronger visibility and an updated identity for the organization; enhancing both our customers’ and employees’ experience working with and for the company; and continuing to achieve growth and strengthen our financial position. This strategic mission is comprised of five key objectives:
 •Market Segmentation & Corporate Identity. We have aligned our sales strategy to best serve each of three specific market segments that we currently support: (i) commercial oral solid dose products, including commercial tech transfer; (ii) our legacy profit-sharing products such as Verapamil; and (iii) early-stage development clients that represent a growing segment of our business. Our strategy calls for the development and execution of specific, targeted sales strategies for each segment. The decision-making processes, key drivers and metrics of success, project and product life-cycle management, and the approach to creating productive relationships with our clients are different enough for each of these three segments that we believe using this differentiated and focused approach is most effective for our customer base and our ability to optimize our operational and resource prioritization. With this strategic shift, we have seen good momentum with a growing sales pipeline in 2022. This change also allows Societal to have a more focused management of legacy programs as outlined above. Lastly, the successful rebranding of the company to Societal CDMO, and the adoption of our tag line, “Bringing Science to Society,” helps us improve our identity and brand strength as a true CDMO partner in the biopharma market. With this brand evolution, we continue to effectively communicate our commitment as a partner to our clients as well as to our people, both present and future.
 •Capabilities Optimization and Expansion. We continue to work to optimize our organizational structure and expand our capabilities. During 2022, we launched our new aseptic fill/finish and lyophilization services and recently expanded our filling and lyophilization capabilities to include biologics. We have created and expect to continue to expand strong synergies and efficiencies in our sales and marketing, quality and regulatory systems, human resources and people engagement practices, environmental health and safety policies, business systems and operational excellence processes. We plan to also continue to enhance our current capabilities and expand our operations to accommodate our growing customer base and attract new customers. We are structuring our organization to ensure execution and delivery of success including identifying opportunities for automation and digitalization of processes and ways of working. We also plan to expand our capabilities by identifying additional acquisition or expansion opportunities to broaden our offerings and grow our base of business.
 •Client Experience and Trust. While we have long enjoyed our reputation as a high-quality partner, we believe that there is always room to improve. It is our goal to strengthen our client interactions, create unparalleled trust and establish valuable partnerships from process development through commercialization. This incorporates a multi-level contract approach which helps strengthen client relationships. During 2022, we introduced the launch of our new 20/80 Second Source Technical Transfer service for our commercial solid oral dose customers. Our team created this new service model in response to the growing risks and vulnerabilities associated with the global supply chain that have significantly elevated the importance of second source suppliers within the pharmaceutical industry. It is also important that, where it makes sense, we harmonize the experience our clients have at each of our sites. We have effective approaches to client communications and project management and want to deploy those approaches consistently across our organization. Additionally, we have adapted a new sales and proposal writing process, with the goal of streamlining the RFP process. All of the changes have been positively received by our clients. While we continue to make great strides with our customer experience, we intend to further improve their overall experience with Societal.
 •Employee Experience and Culture. We aspire to establish an industry-leading employee experience and corporate culture of support, growth and professionalism that allows our employees not only to work but to thrive. During 2022, Societal CDMO was certified by Great Place to Work in the United States. As our employees drive our success, it is our goal to create an inspiring, flexible and rewarding experience for everyone at our company. In doing so, we believe we will strengthen both recruitment, employee engagement and retention, leading to a better workplace, better performance and better outcomes for our clients and for our company’s financial performance.


•Financial Strength. We will continue to take steps to improve our financial strength. In 2022, successfully executed a multi-step strategy to recast our capital structure, improve our balance sheet and strengthen our overall financial profile. Specifically, we repaid and retired a $100.0 million debt facility with Athyrium financed through a sale and leaseback of our Gainesville, Georgia manufacturing site and campus, a sale of common and preferred stock and a new debt facility for $36.9 million from Royal Bank of Canada. We also signed an agreement to sell approximately 121 acres of land for $9.1 million. Combined, these transactions were advantageous to Societal CDMO with respect to debt leverage, maturity and interest. We will continue to carefully manage our cash, work to further reduce our debt, and engage in a consistent and transparent fashion with the investment community.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that the strong relationships we have with our commercial partners result from of our competitive strengths. In particular:
 •Our Operational Excellence. We maintain a commitment to continually improve productivity and customer service levels and maintain excellent quality and regulatory compliance systems. We measure our operational excellence using industry-standard performance indicators such as our on time, in full delivery rate. We believe that our strong historical track record for operational excellence differentiates us from our competitors.
 •Focus on Specialized Markets. We participate in specialized markets where significant technical expertise provides a competitive advantage. This includes differentiated drug delivery, controlled substance and complex formulation. One of our core areas of expertise is modified release oral solid dosage form development and manufacturing and custom release profile development, including for DEA controlled substance products. We developed extended, controlled and sustained release mechanisms for several current commercial products.
 •Our Longstanding Relationships with Our Partners. We continue to maintain longstanding, collaborative relationships with our customers. We believe this allows us to leverage our extensive experience and deep knowledge of their business to better address our commercial partners’ business and developmental goals.

The agreement has a term of three years, expiring April 30, 2025, and is subject to auto-renewal. Either we or InfectoPharm may elect not to renew this agreement by giving the other party at least one hundred eighty days prior written notice prior to the expiration of the agreement.


Backlog
 Our backlog represents, as of a point in time, future revenue from work not yet completed under clinical and pre-clinical signed contracts. As of December 31, 2022, our backlog was approximately $24 million. While we anticipate the majority of our backlog will be recognized during fiscal year 2023, our backlog is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: the risk that a customer timely cancels its commitments prior to our initiation of manufacturing services, in which case we may be required to refund some or all of the amounts paid to us in advance under those canceled commitments; and the risk that a customer may experience delays in its program(s) or otherwise, which could result in the postponement of anticipated manufacturing services; the risk that we may not successfully execute on all customer projects, any of which could have a negative impact on our liquidity, reported backlog and future revenue and profitability.
Permits and Regulatory Approvals
 We are required to comply with the regulatory requirements of various local, state, national and international regulatory bodies having jurisdiction in the countries or localities where we manufacture products or where our customers’ products are distributed. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning research and development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with cGMPs, labeling and distribution, import and export, and product registration and listing, and compliance with post-marketing reporting obligations. As a result, our facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as regulatory bodies of other jurisdictions in which we operate.
 We hold various licenses and registrations for our manufacturing activities. The primary licenses and registrations held are FDA Registrations of Drug Establishments and DEA Controlled Substance Registration. Due to certain U.S. state law requirements, we also hold certain state licenses for distribution activities throughout certain states. We also hold cGMP certifications for European Union, or EU, importation of products made in Gainesville for sale in the EU and an ANVISA certification for sale in Brazil. Compliance with these licensing and regulatory requirements is a key aspect of our business and, if there are changes in the regulations applicable to our business in the United States or other jurisdictions, we may be required to obtain additional approvals or operate according to different manufacturing or operating standards or pay additional fees. This may require a change in our manufacturing techniques or additional capital investments in our facilities.
 In certain of our commercial partnerships, our commercial partner is the product authorization holder for products that have been developed on behalf of the commercial partner. In other commercial partnerships, we are the authorization holder. When our commercial partner holds the relevant authorization from the FDA or other national regulator, we support this authorization by furnishing a letter of reference to the Drug Master File, or the chemistry, manufacturing and related data to the relevant regulator or sponsor to provide adequate manufacturing support in respect of the product. We generally update this information annually with the relevant regulator.
 We hold the approved NDAs for Verelan SR and Verelan PM, which we license to Lannett and Teva, respectively. Verapamil SR and Verapamil PM are authorized generics.
 Environmental and Safety Matters
 Certain products manufactured by us involve the use, storage and transportation of toxic or hazardous material. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emissions, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and the maintenance of safe working conditions. We maintain environmental and industrial safety and health compliance programs and training at our facilities.
 Prevailing legislation tends to hold companies primarily responsible for the proper disposal of their waste even after transfer to third party waste disposal facilities. Other future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us and could subject the handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants at our facilities to more rigorous scrutiny than at present.


Intellectual Property
 The products we produce for our commercial partners are also typically covered by patents and patent applications owned by them. Although certain patents may have expired or may expire in the future, we believe there are other barriers to entry for our commercial partners and competition, including ownership of regulatory filings, NDAs, abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, and drug master files, or DMFs, manufacturing trade secrets, proprietary dosage strengths, pricing limitations in various geographies, costs to revalidate with another supplier, maturity and life-cycle stage of products. We have acquired and developed and continue to acquire and develop knowledge and expertise and trade secrets in the provision of formulation, process development and manufacturing services. We intend to rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality agreements and license agreements, to protect our proprietary know-how.
Competition
 The contract development and manufacturing industry for pharmaceuticals is intensely competitive and highly regulated. Our current and future competitors include other CDMOs as well as segments of larger pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger staff and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations.
 We compete with other CDMOs such as Adare Pharma Solutions, Aenova Alcami, Avara Pharmaceutical Services, Corden Pharma, CoreRx, Pharmaceutics International, Quotient Sciences and Recipharm, segments of larger companies such as Patheon (a segment of ThermoFisher Scientific), Lonza and Catalent, as well as other development and manufacturing service providers.
 Government Regulation
 Governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, post-market reporting, promotion, distribution, marketing, export and import of prescription drugs, such as those we are developing and manufacturing. Any drug products developed or manufactured by us are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, which impose procedural and documentation requirements. The FDA or other regulatory agencies can delay approval of a drug if our manufacturing facilities are not able to demonstrate compliance with cGMPs, pass other aspects of pre-approval inspections (i.e., compliance with filed submissions) or properly scale up to produce commercial supplies. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors, and those supplying products, ingredients and components of them, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other regulations. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of product approval, recall or seizure of the product or other voluntary, FDA‑initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further operations.
 The DSCSA added new sections to the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, that require manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, dispensers, and third-party logistics providers to take steps to identify and trace certain prescription drugs to protect against the threats of counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful drugs in the supply chain. Among other mandates, the DSCSA requires manufacturers and repackagers to affix or imprint a unique product identifier (comprised of a standardized numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date of the product) on certain prescription drug packages in both a human-readable and on a machine-readable data carrier. The standardized numerical identifier is comprised of the product’s corresponding National Drug Code combined with a unique alphanumeric serial number. A drug product is misbranded if it does not bear the product identifier as required by Section 582 of the FD&C Act. Section 582 also established several requirements relating to the verification of product identifiers.

Certain products that we manufacture are regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered and enforced by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control and handling of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule.
 The DEA regulates controlled substances by controlling them in five schedules. Schedule I and II controlled substances have a high potential for abuse, whereas Schedule III-V controlled substances have relatively decreasing potential for abuse. Therefore, the DEA imposes more stringent controls on Schedule I and II substances than Schedule III-V substances, including stricter security controls, quotas, and increased recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Certain of the products we manufacture and/or develop are regulated as Schedule II controlled substances. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much certain controlled substances that we manufacture may be produced in total in the United States, based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. This limited aggregate amount that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce any Schedule II substance. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. In April 2018, the DEA proposed new guidelines aimed at strengthening the process for setting controls over diversion of controlled substances and making other improvements in the quota managements regulatory system for the production, manufacturing and procurement of controlled substances. Following a public comment period, the DEA published the final guidelines, which were substantially similar to the proposed guidelines, in July 2018. For 2019, the DEA proposed decreased manufacturing quotas for the six most frequently misused opioids, including hydrocodone, which we used in the manufacture of certain products, by an average of 10% as compared to the 2018 quotas. The DEA proposed further decreasing manufacturing quotas in 2020 for five of the six opioids, including hydrocodone, by an average of 28%. Together with reductions in morphine, this is a 53% decrease since 2016. In October 2019, the DEA proposed additional regulations to amend the manner in which the agency grants quotas to manufacturers. The proposed regulations, if finalized, would establish use-specific quotas, including commercial sales, product development, transfer, replacement, and packaging. To decrease the risk of diversion and increase accountability, inventory allowances would be reduced, and procurement quota certifications will be required. In April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the DEA adjusted the established 2020 aggregate production quotas and assessment of annual needs for select Schedule II substances. The DEA took this action to ensure that the country has an adequate and uninterrupted supply of these substances during the public health emergency. In November 2020, the DEA finalized further decreases to the quota for hydrocodone by 11.5%, which it had proposed in September 2020. In October 2021, the DEA proposed further decreases of 4% to the quota for hydrocodone for 2022. The DEA finalized the 2023 quotas in December 2022 and includes a 5% decrease for Schedule II opioids such as oxycodone and hydrocodone.
 The DEA requires facilities that manufacture controlled substances to adhere to certain security requirements. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances and periodic reports must be made to the DEA, for example, distribution, acquisition, and inventory reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance and suspicious orders. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.
 The DEA requires drug manufacturers to design and implement a system that identifies suspicious orders of controlled substances, such as those of unusual size, those that deviate substantially from a normal pattern and those of unusual frequency, prior to completion of the sale. A compliant suspicious order monitoring, or SOM, system includes well-defined due diligence, “know your customer” efforts and order monitoring.
 To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We are subject to state regulation of distribution for these products. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly where noncompliance results in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations, or take other enforcement action. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal prosecution.


In addition to DEA regulations, the U.S. government and state legislatures have enacted legislation and regulations intended to fight the opioid epidemic. In February 2016, the FDA released an action plan to address the opioid epidemic, which is part of a broader initiative led by the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the release of a new Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, FDA’s requirement of enhanced warnings and safety labeling, and institution of a class-wide Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMs, as a condition of approval. Further, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, was passed in 2016. CARA provides resources to improve state monitoring of controlled substances, including opioids. A Senate bill introduced in February 2018, known as CARA 2.0, would further limit initial prescriptions for opioids to three days, while exempting initial prescriptions for chronic care, cancer care, hospice or end of life care, and palliative care. CARA 2.0 would also increase civil and criminal penalties for opioid manufacturers that fail to report suspicious orders for opioids or fail to maintain effective controls against diversion of opioids. More recently, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act, or Support Act, has been enacted. It provides for further regulation as well as funding for research and development of non-addictive painkillers. State legislatures have followed in the footsteps of the federal government in passing similar laws intended to limit prescription sales and quantities as well as increase the ability to monitor and regulate the manufacture and sale of opioids.

All employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and are required to attend annual training to help prevent, identify, report, and stop any type of discrimination and harassment.

Competitive Pay & Benefits
 We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include potential annual discretionary bonuses, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, paid time off, various leave programs and flexible work schedules, among others. In addition, we offer every full-time employee, both exempt and non-exempt, the benefit of equity ownership in the company through stock option grants. We have also used targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly those with critical drug development skills and experience.
Safety
 The safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. In response to COVID-19, we implemented enhanced safety protocols including shift work scheduling to reduce number of people in the facility, requirements for the wearing of masks and for social distancing, increased cleaning procedures and readily available hand sanitizer. These protocols were designed to comply with health and safety standards as required by federal, state, and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. In addition, we have provided work-at-home arrangements for employees who are able to do so.
