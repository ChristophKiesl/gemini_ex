ITEM 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of cancer patients through the discovery, development, and commercialization of transformative targeted therapies. Our development programs are designed to address drug resistance mutations in key driver oncogenes, which are mutated genes that cause cancer. Resistance mutations limit the efficacy of existing targeted therapies by rendering tumor cells unresponsive to drugs, and therefore present a critical challenge in cancer treatment today. Our initial focus is on developing the next generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs, and is rooted in the critical role that tyrosine kinases play in the development of cancer. Despite the commercial success of approved TKIs, the development of drug resistance is a persistent limitation, narrowing the number of effective treatment options available to patients as they progress through subsequent lines of therapy.
Our goal is to develop “pan-variant” kinase inhibitors-inhibitors that target all major cancer causing and drug resistance mutations in clinically significant protein kinases. We believe that truly pan-variant inhibitors are required to effectively inhibit the heterogeneous mix of resistance mutations found in patients, and may also suppress the emergence of new mutations when used in earlier lines of therapy. To develop such inhibitors, we deploy our novel Predictive Resistance Assay™, or PRA, a highly differentiated cell-based method for testing TKIs that we believe is predictive for “pan-ness”. We also employ structure-guided drug design, and, coupled with our PRA, we believe our approach has the potential to optimize molecules for pan-variant activity while maintaining selectivity and tolerability.
Our most advanced product candidate, THE-630, is a pan-variant inhibitor of all major classes of activating and resistance mutations of the KIT kinase for the treatment of GIST, a type of cancer most often characterized by oncogenic activation of KIT. GIST is the most common sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract and often initiates in the stomach or small intestines. We are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 1/2 dose escalation and dose expansion clinical trial for the evaluation of THE-630 in patients with advanced GIST whose disease has developed resistance to prior KIT-targeting therapies. As of December 31, 2022, we were treating patients in cohort 5 of dose escalation, with all seven planned Phase 1 sites in the US open and enrolling patients. We expect to present initial data from the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the clinical trial at an academic meeting in the second quarter of 2023, and to report additional data from the dose escalation study at an academic meeting in the fourth quarter of 2023. The primary objective of the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study are to evaluate the safety profile of THE-630, including the determination of a recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, in GIST patients who have received imatinib and at least one other TKI. Secondary objectives include determining the pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile of THE-630, and to characterize preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of THE-630. Once an RP2D is determined, the study will transition into the Phase 2 portion consisting of three expansion cohorts in patients with second-line GIST, third or fourth-line GIST, and fifth (or greater) line GIST. The Phase 2 dose expansion portion is expected to include sites in the US and Europe. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to THE-630 for the treatment of GIST.
Our second product candidate is THE-349, a fourth-generation EGFR inhibitor for the treatment of NSCLC. THE-349 is designed to address on-target treatment resistance to existing EGFR inhibitors by targeting the common activating mutations in exons 19 and 21 alone or in combination with the most frequently observed resistance mutations, T790M and C797X. Preclinical characterization of THE-349 as central nervous system, or CNS active, and mutant-selective inhibitor with potent activity against single-, double-, and triple-mutant EGFR variants, including T790M and C797X, was shared in a poster presentation at the 34th EORTC-NCI-AACR, or ENA, Symposium in Barcelona on October 26-28, 2022. We have initiated IND-enabling studies, and expect to file an IND application for this product candidate with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2023. We plan to pursue initial clinical development as monotherapy in patients with C797X-mediated resistance after treatment with osimertinib, or another third-generation inhibitor, and then, assuming positive clinical data and subject to discussions with the FDA, expand into evaluation of combination treatment with other relevant 

5



modalities and, if clinical data support, target a broader second-line patient population to address the unmet need of patients who have been previously treated with osimertinib, but progress with either on-target or off-target resistance.
Our third program is a next-generation BCR-ABL TKI that we are designing to be potent, selective, and pan-variant—features that we believe would balance safety and efficacy—for patients with relapsed/refractory chronic myeloid leukemia, or CML, and Philadelphia chromosome-positive, or Ph+, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL. We expect to nominate a development candidate for this program by early 2024, with the goal of pursuing clinical development in patients with CML who have been previously treated with a second-generation TKI or have the T315I mutation, and in combination therapy for newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ ALL.
Our differentiated approach to addressing drug resistance is built on three strategic pillars: (1) targeting clinically-validated oncogenic drivers that have a clear unmet need; (2) integrating structure-guided drug design with our predictive screening methodologies, including our PRA; and (3) pursuing translationally-driven, biomarker-guided clinical development strategies. We believe our research and development approach, honed over years of our management team’s experience in developing approved therapeutics at ARIAD, positions us well to develop a pipeline of drugs to address the challenges posed by resistance mutations.
Our Pipeline
Our current product candidates, targeting KIT (THE-630) and EGFR (THE-349), and our BCR-ABL program, are next-generation TKIs that aim to address the key limitation of drug resistance, and are summarized below:

THE-630: Pan-Variant KIT Inhibitor
Our most advanced product candidate, THE-630, is a pan-variant KIT inhibitor for the treatment of patients with advanced GIST. GIST is the most common sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract and is often initiates in the stomach or small intestines. Current estimates for the total number of GIST cases diagnosed each year in the US range from approximately 4,000 to 6,000. Prevalence is estimated to be 13.5 to 15.5 cases per 100,000 people, and therefore approximately 48,000 patients are estimated to be living with GIST in the US each year. Front-line intervention is surgical removal of cancerous tissue when possible. In cases where the 

6



tumor has spread and/or surgery cannot be performed, the TKI imatinib is often used as first-line therapy. However, most patients receiving imatinib relapse and subsequent lines of therapy are less effective.
​
THE-630 is a novel small molecule TKI that has been designed to block activity of all major classes of activating and resistance mutations of KIT that drive GIST. Existing TKIs for GIST are limited by the emergence of resistance mutations, as clinical data have demonstrated their inability to inhibit disease progression as these mutations arise in tumor cell populations. THE-630 is a pan-variant KIT inhibitor for GIST, with potent activity demonstrated in cellular assays and strong anti-tumor activity demonstrated in animal models against both activating and resistance mutations. We believe THE-630, if approved, has the potential to overcome limitations of existing TKIs based on its promising inhibitory profile and favorable drug-like properties, as well as its potential to achieve predicted pan-variant KIT inhibitory blood concentrations at tolerable doses in preclinical safety studies.
​
We are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 1/2 dose escalation and dose expansion clinical trial for the evaluation of THE-630 in patients with advanced GIST whose disease has developed resistance to prior KIT-targeting therapies. We expect to present initial data from the Phase 1 portion of the clinical trial at an academic meeting in the second quarter of 2023, and to report additional data from the dose escalation study at an academic meeting in the fourth quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we were treating patients in cohort 5 of dose escalation, with all seven planned Phase 1 sites in the US open and enrolling patients. The primary objective of the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study is to evaluate the safety profile of THE-630, including determination of an RP2D, in GIST patients who have received imatinib and at least one other TKI. Secondary objectives include determining the PK profile of THE-630, and to characterize preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of THE-630. Once an RP2D is determined, the study will transition into the Phase 2 portion consisting of three expansion cohorts in patients with second-line GIST, third or four-line GIST and fifth (or greater) line GIST. The Phase 2 dose expansion portion is expected to include sites in the US and Europe.
Assuming positive clinical data and subject to discussions with the FDA, our registration strategy will evaluate THE-630 in two different GIST populations. One population will be GIST patients who have already received four prior lines of therapy, or fifth-line GIST, where there is currently no available therapy and therefore a significant unmet medical need. Given its broad mutational coverage as a pan-variant KIT inhibitor, we also plan to evaluate THE-630 in GIST patients who only received prior imatinib, or in second-line GIST. Our goal is to pursue our registrational trials in fifth-line and second-line GIST in parallel. Based on the preclinical profile and known clinical limitations of marketed therapies for GIST, we believe THE-630 has the potential to deliver meaningful clinical benefit over the currently available standards of care.
The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to THE-630 for the treatment of GIST.
THE-349: Fourth-Generation EGFR Inhibitor
Our second product candidate is THE-349, which is a fourth-generation inhibitor of EGFR that is active against 1) C797X, the most common EGFR mutation that causes resistance to osimertinib in patients with NSCLC, 2) the most common activating mutations in EGFR, and 3) T790M, the most common mutation that confers resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR inhibitors. In addition, preclinical data have demonstrated that THE-349 has a high degree of kinome and wild-type EGFR selectivity, and exhibits substantial CNS activity. 
NSCLC is the most common form of lung cancer with approximately 10% to 50% of NSCLC tumors driven by activating mutations in EGFR, depending on geographic region. Treatment of EGFR-mutant metastatic NSCLC patients with first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs, such as erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and dacomitinib, substantively improved outcomes for patients compared to chemotherapy. However, resistance eventually develops in most patients, leading to disease progression, with about half of patients’ tumors developing the T790M EGFR mutation. Osimertinib, a third-generation TKI, was initially developed to treat T790M-positive disease in patients progressing on a first- or second-generation TKI. Subsequently, it was 

7



approved in the first-line setting in the US where it improved progression-free and overall survival compared to earlier-generation inhibitors. However, most patients receiving treatment eventually progress. A subset of patients on osimertinib, either in first- or later-line therapy, will still progress due to further EGFR resistance mutations, with C797X being the most common of such mutations. A significant unmet medical need remains for patients with this subset of EGFR-mutant NSCLC.
​
To address this problem of on-target resistance, we have developed THE-349, a TKI designed to inhibit the full range of single-, double- and triple-mutant variants found in the tumors of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC that have developed resistance to osimertinib in first- or later-line therapy, including the C797X and T790M mutations. Preclinical data demonstrate THE-349 can potently inhibit these major classes of EGFR activating and resistance mutations, possesses kinome and wild-type EGFR selectivity, and has CNS activity. We expect to file an IND for this product candidate with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2023, and to initiate the Phase 1/2 trial as soon as possible thereafter, subject to clearance of the IND by the FDA. We plan to pursue an initial clinical development as monotherapy in patients with C797X-mediated resistance, and then, assuming positive clinical data and subject to discussions with the FDA, expand into evaluation of combination treatment with other relevant modalities and, if clinical data support, target a broader second-line patient population to address the unmet need of patients who have been previously treated with osimertinib, but progress with either on-target or off-target resistance. We believe that continued EGFR inhibition, in combination with other relevant effective modalities, will be necessary to optimally treat patients who develop off-target resistance to osimertinib, given the clonal heterogeneity of the disease.
Our Strategy
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of cancer patients through the discovery, development, and commercialization of transformative targeted therapies. Our development programs are designed to address drug resistance mutations in key driver oncogenes, which are mutated genes that cause cancer. The key elements of our strategy to achieve our mission are:
​

● | Advance the development of our most advanced product candidate, THE-630, for GIST patients. We designed THE-630 as a differentiated TKI for the treatment of patients with previously-treated GIST. We believe that the broad inhibitory profile of THE-630 against all major classes of activating and resistance mutations in KIT has the potential to generate robust and durable responses for advanced GIST patients across the spectrum of previously-treated patient populations. Our registration strategy is expected to be focused on fifth-line and second-line GIST. There is currently no available therapy and therefore a significant unmet medical need in the fifth-line GIST setting. Given its broad mutational coverage as a pan-variant KIT inhibitor, we also plan to evaluate THE-630 in second-line GIST. We plan to pursue our fifth-line and second-line registrational trials in parallel.

​

● | Advance THE-349, our fourth-generation EGFR inhibitor product candidate for NSCLC patients. We have developed THE-349, a TKI designed to inhibit the full range of single-, double- and triple-mutant variants found in the tumors of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC that have developed resistance to osimertinib in first- or later-line therapy, including the C797X and T790M mutations. We believe that THE-349 has the potential to meaningfully improve patient outcomes in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who have progressed on osimertinib given its broad and potent EGFR mutation coverage, its selectivity, and CNS activity. We expect to file an IND for this product candidate with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2023.

​

● | Leverage our differentiated research and discovery approach to advance our BCR-ABL program and expand our pipeline. Mutational resistance has the potential to affect the therapeutic utility of a broad range of existing oncology therapies. Our structure-guided drug design approach, integrated with our PRA, allows us to efficiently design and validate novel inhibitors against known targets that target all major activating and resistance mutations. In January 2023, we announced that our next program will be a TKI to inhibit BCR-ABL fusions, which are implicated in two diseases, CML

and Ph+ ALL, for which there are significant unmet needs for therapies that optimally balance safety and efficacy. Beyond BCR-ABL, we expect to initially focus on discovering additional kinase inhibitors, and we may also explore other oncogenic driver targets. In addition to our in-house research, we may evaluate in-licensing opportunities that could be synergistic with our pipeline.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Build a leading, fully integrated precision oncology company to maximize the clinical impact and value of our pipeline. We believe the targeted nature of our research and discovery approach allows for efficient and focused clinical development. By developing drugs for known targets where TKI activity has previously been established, we believe we can minimize biology risk in our product development lifespan. We continue to build a lean, experienced team to rapidly advance product candidates in a capital-efficient manner. We currently intend to retain the commercialization rights to our product candidates in the US; however, we may opportunistically enter into strategic collaborations in certain geographic or clinical settings to maximize the value of our pipeline.

​
Our Research and Discovery Approach
Our approach to drug discovery is characterized by the identification of therapeutic solutions responsive to resistance mutations in certain cancers with clear unmet need. Our drug discovery approach is built on three pillars:
​

● | Clinically validated targets with clear unmet need. We are focused exclusively on well-validated targets that are directly linked to the proliferation and survival of a tumor, known as driver oncogenes, for which the clinical activity of TKI therapies has already been established, and where there is a clear unmet need. We believe this approach can allow us to identify targets more reliably for our programs since data in patients have shown that successful inhibition of these targets will typically have the intended biological effect. We further focus on targets where there is documented observation of resistance mutations, no pan-variant TKI available to patients and lack of further treatment options for patients that have been failed by existing standards of care. These settings have a clear unmet need with a strong rationale for the development of a pan-variant inhibitor.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Structure-guided drug design integrated with predictive screening methodologies. We design small molecule inhibitors based on deep structural knowledge of our targets and candidate molecules at the molecular level. We acquire high-resolution, atom-level structural maps of activated and mutated target proteins using techniques such as X-ray crystallography, and we supplement these with computational modeling to understand the precise changes induced by mutations. We use these approaches to guide iterative rounds of synthesis and testing of molecules. This allows us to design novel small molecule inhibitors that target all major activating and resistance mutations. To test these molecules, we deploy our PRA, a novel screening and characterization approach that incorporates two critical human serum proteins that can affect drug activity. We believe our PRA is a highly differentiated cell-based method for testing small molecule TKIs under conditions that mimic the physiological setting and that it is predictive for “pan-ness”, the ability to inhibit all major classes of activating and resistance mutations in a given target. By comparing TKI inhibitory values in this assay to achievable human blood levels of TKIs, our approach allows us to select TKIs for clinical testing that we believe have the potential to perform best in cancer patients, irrespective of mutational status. As such, although to date our PRA has not been clinically validated, we believe it allows us to apply our drug discovery expertise in selecting small molecule inhibitors that have the optimal properties for further development and testing.

​

● | Translationally-driven, biomarker-guided clinical development. We design clinical development programs that are intended to supply rich biomarker datasets to provide us with an early assessment of activity against individual mutant variants. By monitoring mutational status of patients before and during treatment, we aim to validate the inhibition of individual mutant forms of the target protein, then correlate this with overall clinical response. We believe this will provide us with insights of potential

THE-630: Our Pan-Variant KIT Inhibitor 
Summary Overview
Our most advanced product candidate, THE-630, is a next-generation KIT inhibitor for the treatment of patients with advanced GIST. GIST is the most common sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract and often initiates in the stomach or small intestines. The worldwide annual incidence of GIST is estimated to be between 11 and 19.6 cases per million people. Current estimates for the total number of GIST cases diagnosed each year in the US range from approximately 4,000 to 6,000. Prevalence is estimated to be 13.5 to 15.5 cases per 100,000 people, and therefore approximately 48,000 patients are estimated to be living with GIST in the US each year. We estimate that the annual addressable population for first- and second-line unresectable or metastatic GIST in the US is approximately 3,200 and 2,200 patients, respectively. Approximately 80% are driven by activating mutations in the KIT kinase. Front line intervention is surgical removal of cancerous tissue when possible. In cases where the tumor has spread and/or surgery cannot be performed, the TKI imatinib is often used as first-line therapy. Most patients receiving imatinib relapse, often with multiple KIT kinase resistance mutations, and subsequent lines of therapy are typically less effective due to a lack of coverage over all major resistance mutations in KIT, meaning that all patients who relapse are expected to ultimately succumb to their cancer. Therefore, a significant unmet need exists for GIST patients.
​
THE-630 is a novel small molecule TKI that blocks activity of all major classes of KIT activating and resistance mutations that drive GIST. Existing TKIs are limited by the emergence of resistance mutations, as clinical data have demonstrated their inability to inhibit disease progression as these mutations arise in tumor cell populations. THE-630 is a pan-variant KIT inhibitor for GIST, with potent activity demonstrated in cellular assays and strong anti-tumor activity in animal models against both activating and resistance mutations. We believe THE-630, if approved, has the potential to be a best-in-class KIT inhibitor for GIST patients based on its promising inhibitory profile and favorable drug-like properties, as well as its ability to achieve predicted pan-variant KIT inhibitory blood concentrations at tolerable doses in preclinical safety studies.
​
We are currently enrolling patients in the Phase 1 portion of a Phase 1/2 dose escalation and dose expansion clinical trial in patients with previously-treated GIST. The Phase 1 portion is enrolling patients with prior treatment with imatinib and at least one of the following: sunitinib, regorafenib, ripretinib, or avapritinib. We expect to present initial data from the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the clinical trial in an academic meeting in the second quarter of 2023 and to report additional data from the dose escalation study at an academic meeting in the fourth quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we were treating patients in cohort 5 of dose escalation, with all seven planned Phase 1 sites in the US open and enrolling patients. The primary objective of the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study is to evaluate the safety profile of THE-630, including determination of an RP2D. Secondary objectives include determining the PK profile of THE-630, and to characterize preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of THE-630. Once an RP2D is determined, the study will transition into the Phase 2 portion consisting of three expansion cohorts in patients with second-line GIST, third- or four-line GIST, and fifth- (or greater) line GIST. The Phase 2 dose expansion portion is expected to include sites in the US and Europe. 
Assuming positive clinical data and subject to discussions with the FDA, our registration strategy will evaluate THE-630 in two different GIST populations. One population will be GIST patients who have already received four prior lines of therapy, or fifth-line GIST, where there is currently no available therapy and therefore a significant unmet medical need. Given its broad mutational coverage as a pan-variant KIT inhibitor, we also plan to evaluate THE-630 in GIST patients who have only received prior imatinib, or second-line GIST. We plan to pursue our registrational trials in fifth-line and second-line GIST in parallel. Based on the preclinical profile and known limitations to marketed therapies for GIST, we believe THE-630 has the potential to deliver meaningful clinical benefit over the currently available standards of care.

Overview of GIST and KIT Mutations
GIST is the most common tumor of the gastrointestinal tract and presents most often in the stomach or small intestine. In adult GIST patients, approximately 95% of tumors overexpress the tyrosine kinase receptor KIT, while approximately 80% have KIT gene mutations that activate the KIT receptor. In normal cells, KIT receptor tyrosine kinase, or RTK, activity is regulated by binding of the endogenous ligand for the receptor. Activation of the KIT kinase caused by mutations leads to uncontrolled cancer cell growth, leading to tumor formation. As shown in Figure 1 below, there are two major classes of activating mutations in KIT that occur in different exons of the gene:
​

● | KIT exon 11 activating mutations occur in approximately 70% of newly diagnosed GIST patients. These mutations are located in an intracellular domain of the receptor that usually has an inhibitory effect on kinase activation, thereby interfering with this normal inhibitory function.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | KIT exon 9 activating mutations occur in approximately 10% of newly diagnosed GIST patients. These mutations affect an extracellular domain, which results in ligand-independent KIT activation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Successful targeting of KIT activating mutations by existing KIT inhibitors almost always leads to the emergence of one or more additional mutations, at separate sites in the protein, that make the tumor resistant to the inhibitor. As shown in Figure 1 below, there are also two major classes of resistance mutations that occur in different exons of the gene:

● | KIT exon 13 and exon 14 resistance mutations are seen in up to approximately 45% of GIST patients who develop resistance to imatinib. These mutations occur in a region of the protein known as the ATP-binding pocket and block, or reduce, the ability of inhibitors to bind and impede kinase activity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | KIT exon 17 and exon 18 resistance mutations are also seen in up to approximately 45% of GIST patients who develop resistance to imatinib. These mutations occur in a region of the protein known as the activation loop and block, or reduce, the ability of inhibitors to bind and impede kinase activity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Figure 1. The major classes of activating mutations in the KIT gene in GIST patients are found in exons 9 and 11 and the major classes of resistance mutations in the KIT gene in GIST patients are found in exons 13/14 and 17/18.

Current Treatment Paradigm in GIST
Patients diagnosed with localized GIST will typically undergo surgery to remove their tumor lesions, and those at high risk of recurrence may then receive post-operative imatinib as adjuvant therapy. Patients who present with metastatic disease at diagnosis or those who are not eligible to undergo surgical resection have several systemic treatment options at different lines of therapy. As summarized in Figure 2 below, the majority of patients receiving imatinib therapy will experience tumor progression and then progress relatively rapidly on second-, third-, and fourth-line treatments, successively. Patient outcomes are substantially worse following imatinib failure, with response rates of less than 10% for each successive line of therapy.

LINE | THERAPY | ORR | MEDIAN PFS 
First-line | lmatinib | 51.4% | 18.9 months
Second-line | Sunitinib | 6.8% | 5.5 months 
Third-line | Regorafenib | 4.5% | 4.8 months 
Fourth-line | Ripretinib | 9.4% | 6.3 months 

​
Figure 2. Response rate and progression-free survival, or PFS, in successive lines of KIT-targeting therapies. Overall response rate, or ORR, includes all patients who had a 30% or greater reduction in tumor size. PFS is the length of time after initiation of treatment that a patient lives with the cancer but it does not get worse.
Limitations of Current Treatment Options and Unmet Medical Need in GIST
Despite the availability of multiple TKIs as treatment options across various lines of disease, the five-year overall survival rate of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST is less than 60%.
​
Disease progression is most often driven by mutations in KIT that create resistance to the currently approved KIT targeting therapies. Such resistance mutations are found in up to 90% of tumors after imatinib failure. The resistance mutations are mainly found in two regions of the kinase domain: the ATP-binding pocket encoded within exons 13 and 14 and the activation loop encoded within exons 17 and 18.
​
In addition, the heterogeneity of tumor cell populations complicates the treatment of resistant GIST. Patients frequently have multiple subclones of their cancer, each with a different resistance mutation in KIT. As a result, the treatment with a TKI that only inhibits some of the resistance mutations, and therefore growth of only some of the tumor cells, will likely result in rapid outgrowth of unaffected subclones and overall disease progression.
​
Imatinib and sunitinib have activity against the activating mutations in exons 9 and 11, although potency against exon 9 mutations is reported to be lower for imatinib. Imatinib has relatively weak activity against resistance mutations in both the ATP-binding pocket and the activation loop, located in exons 13, 14, 17 and 18. Sunitinib is active against imatinib-resistant GIST subclones with resistance mutations in exons 13 and 14 that encode the ATP-binding pocket, including the common V654A mutation. However, it has poor activity against subclones with KIT activation loop mutations encoded by exons 17 and 18. Compared to sunitinib, regorafenib has somewhat more potent activity against activation loop mutations, but is less potent against ATP-binding pocket mutations. In the fourth-line setting, ripretinib yielded a 9.4% response rate and clinical benefit was relatively limited, with half of ripretinib-treated patients in a Phase 3 clinical trial experiencing progression within the first six months of treatment. Furthermore, in preclinical studies, ripretinib reportedly showed relatively low potency against ATP-binding-pocket mutations in exons 13 and 14. 
​
The toxicity profile of some of these therapies also significantly limits their utility in treating patients with advanced GIST. In particular, sunitinib and regorafenib are multi-kinase inhibitors that are associated with more toxicity than imatinib, with side effects including severe hand-foot syndrome, thrombocytopenia, thyroid dysfunction and liver enzyme elevation.
​

12



The clinical benefits of second-line sunitinib and third-line regorafenib are limited: reported median PFS is six months or less in each case, and dose reductions and dose interruptions due to toxicity are commonly reported. Ripretinib has a similar median PFS of approximately six months in patients who have relapsed following treatment with imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib. In a retrospective subgroup analysis from a recent clinical trial in second-line GIST, ripretinib was shown to provide meaningful clinical benefit over sunitinib in the subset of patients with an activating exon 11 mutation and resistance mutations in exons 17/18 only, which would be predicted by our PRA. Median PFS was shown to be 14.2 months and the ORR was 44% for ripretinib. We believe that a pan-variant KIT inhibitor such as THE-630 has the potential to show strong efficacy more broadly in second-line GIST patients, irrespective of the KIT activating and resistance mutations present.
​
Our Solution: THE-630, a Pan-Variant KIT Inhibitor
THE-630 is a pan-variant KIT inhibitor designed to address the limitations of previous generations of TKIs for patients with GIST. We designed THE-630 to have potent activity against both major classes of activating KIT mutations (exons 9 and 11), and both major classes of KIT resistance mutations that arise in: (1) the ATP-binding pocket (exons 13 and 14) and (2) the activation loop (exons 17 and 18). In preclinical studies, THE-630 achieved the predicted pan-variant KIT inhibitory blood concentrations at tolerable doses and induced significant anti-tumor activity. Given the heterogeneity of the tumor cell populations in GIST patients whose tumors progress on imatinib, and the incomplete KIT mutational coverage provided by later lines of therapy, we believe developing a next-generation KIT compound that effectively inhibits all major classes of KIT activating and resistance mutations should improve response rates and increase PFS in GIST patients in both later and earlier lines of therapy.
​
Broad KIT Mutation Coverage Supported by In Vitro Data
To accurately measure the activity of product candidates, we developed the PRA, a novel screening and characterization approach that incorporates two critical human serum proteins that can affect drug activity. Using this approach, we believe we can accurately predict the clinical activity of current TKI therapies, including imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib and ripretinib. In so doing, we believe that we can better understand the therapeutic strengths and weaknesses of each compound, thereby allowing us to design THE-630 with an improved product profile.

To evaluate specific TKI activity, we engineered a panel of cell lines, derived from the commonly used murine Ba/F3 cell line, each of which is dependent on the activity of a different KIT variant for survival. These variants include combinations of different activating mutations and ten different resistance mutations known to arise after first and later lines of current TKI therapies in patients with GIST, as shown in Figure 3 below.

To assess the cellular potency of TKIs against each KIT variant, we measure IC50 values, which is the TKI concentration that inhibits cell survival by 50%. To better mimic the functional effects of protein binding on drug activity in humans, we performed the cell survival assays in cell culture medium supplemented with physiologic concentrations of two critical human serum proteins. We then compared these IC50 values to TKI concentrations achieved in patients treated at the clinically utilized dose. TKI concentrations in patients are represented by the average concentration, or Cav, which is calculated as the Area Under the Curve, or AUC, over a 24-hour period and divided by 24. In the context of our PRA, we believe Cav to be a more reliable clinical predictor of therapeutic benefit than the maximum or minimum concentrations observed in patients. Using this measure, we calculated the Cav for imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib and ripretinib in patients at the approved clinical doses as set forth in Figure 4 below.

 nM (nanomolar)
​
Figure 4. The table shows Cav values for approved TKI therapies for GIST, or benchmark TKIs, as calculated from the clinical literature. Ripretinib is known to have an active metabolite, and this was included in the analysis.
We used our PRA to predict the clinical activity of individual approved TKI therapies for GIST against specific KIT variants by comparing TKI potency, as assessed in Ba/F3 cells, to the Cav values in patients. We predicted that KIT variants inhibited by a TKI at a concentration substantially below the patient Cav would be highly sensitive to that TKI but that KIT variants inhibited at a concentration substantially above the Cav would be highly resistant. We further predicted that KIT variants inhibited with a TKI IC50 at a concentration that is 

14



within approximately two-fold of the Cav would initially be associated with a stable disease outcome but ultimately would confer tumor resistance and progression.
​
To illustrate how we use this methodology, we compared Cav levels of sunitinib in GIST patients, and sunitinib potency against several KIT resistance mutations as determined in our cellular assay. As shown in Figure 5 below, our in vitro PRA predicted that sunitinib would have strong activity against ATP-binding pocket mutations but weak activity against activation loop mutations, consistent with the reported clinical data.

Figure 5. Our in vitro PRA correctly recapitulated the clinical patterns of resistance of sunitinib. The prediction of resistance or sensitivity to sunitinib is shown relative to the Cav. The y-axis shows the IC50 values range using a log10 scale. PR/CR means partial/complete response; PD means progressive disease.
Next, we expanded our analysis to include all four approved KIT TKIs against a broad panel of KIT variants. Figure 6 below shows the IC50 values for imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib and ripretinib against all 17 KIT variants, as well as the Cav values for these TKIs in patients. The resulting predictions of TKI activity against each class of activating and resistance mutations, using the approach described above, are shown in Figure 7 below.
​
As was the case for sunitinib, the results of our PRA accurately recapitulated the known clinical patterns of resistance of imatinib and regorafenib, including overall insensitivity against ATP-binding pocket mutations and activation loop mutations. For ripretinib, our PRA predicts only modest clinical activity against activating mutations in exon 9 and against resistance mutations in the ATP-binding pocket, which is consistent with the results seen in the INTRIGUE study evaluating ripretinib versus sunitinib in the second-line GIST setting.  ​
We then evaluated the same panel of KIT mutations in our PRA against our lead TKI product candidate, THE-630, which demonstrated activity against all major classes of activating and resistance mutations at a target Cav of 100 nM.
​
THE-630 showed a wide breadth of inhibitory activities, demonstrating potent activity against the most common activating mutation of exon 11 deletions as well as ten different known resistance mutations. THE-

15



630 also demonstrated potent activity against an alternate exon 11 activating mutation at V560D plus two known resistance mutations. THE-630 also showed potent activity against an exon 9 activating mutation plus two resistance mutations.
​
Based on the activity profile, we believe that if a Cav of 100 nM is achieved in patients, THE-630 will be able to potently inhibit all major classes of activating and resistance mutations. While two mutational combinations of exon 11 deletion plus the exon 17 D816Y mutation, and of exon 9 insertion plus the exon 17 D816H mutation, were not as potently inhibited by THE-630, we note that these variants are very rarely seen in GIST patients, despite being inhibited even less potently by imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib.

Tumor Regression in In Vivo Mouse Models Harboring KIT Activating and Resistance Mutations
We expanded upon the results generated using our PRA by examining the in vivo activity of THE-630 in seven tumor models expressing KIT variants containing both major classes of activating mutations and both major classes of resistance mutations. To do this, we implanted GIST-T1 cells, which express KIT with an activating mutation in exon 11, or Ba/F3 cells engineered with six different KIT variants, subcutaneously into the right flank of female immunocompromised mice, and orally administered THE-630 and other TKIs to groups of mice. Based on a pilot study in mice, which showed that once daily dosing, or QD, of THE-630 at 30 mg/kg exceeded the maximum tolerated dose, all subsequent preclinical efficacy studies used a top dose of either 20 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg of THE-630 QD. At these dose levels, there were no signs of overt toxicity associated with THE-630 treatment in the mice.
​
When sunitinib or ripretinib were included as comparators, mice were dosed orally using standard regimens reported in the literature. For sunitinib, this was 20 mg/kg QD and for ripretinib it was 50 mg/kg twice a day, or BID. Our pharmacokinetic analysis on the treated mice showed the drug exposure levels exceeded that achieved in patients by three-fold for sunitinib and two-fold for ripretinib.
​
Data from all seven models are shown in Figures 8, 9 and 10 below. Also shown is the degree of anti-tumor activity for each TKI, which was calculated as the percent tumor growth inhibition, or TGI, relative to tumors in control mice, unless tumors regressed relative to the first day of treatment, in which case the percent tumor regression, or TR, was calculated. In each study, the control group of mice was dosed orally with the vehicle that each TKI was dissolved in, and on the same schedule.
​
THE-630 demonstrated anti-tumor activity in all seven models. As shown in Figure 8 below, THE-630 had strong anti-tumor activity in models containing an exon 11 activating mutation (85% TR) or an exon 9 activating mutation (58% TR). In contrast, ripretinib demonstrated weak anti-tumor activity in the exon 9 

17



model (17% TGI). As shown in Figure 9 below, THE-630 had strong activity in a model containing a KIT exon 11 activating mutation plus the most common resistance mutation observed in the ATP-binding pocket, V654A (86% TGI), and moderate activity in a model containing the T670I mutant (39% TGI). In contrast, ripretinib had modest or weak activity in both models (26% TGI and 8% TGI). Finally, as shown in Figure 10 below, THE-630 had strong activity in three models containing a KIT exon 11 activating mutation and a resistance mutation in the activation loop, with 83% TR, 59% TR, and 90% TGI seen in models containing N822K, D820A, and A829P, respectively. In contrast, sunitinib had weak or no activity against N822K (25% TGI) and A829P (0% TGI).
​
Therefore, consistent with the results of our in vitro PRA, sunitinib and ripretinib showed in vivo activity only against a subset of activating and resistance mutations. In contrast, THE-630 demonstrated in vivo activity against all major classes of activating and resistance mutations observed in KIT-mutant GIST, consistent with the profile of a pan-variant inhibitor.

Figure 10. In vivo activity of THE-630 and benchmark TKIs in tumor models containing resistance mutations in the KIT activation loop.
To evaluate the kinase selectivity of THE-630, we conducted a single point screen against 330 kinases at 100 nM, using a commercially available screening panel. For comparison, we included ripretinib. Against this panel, THE-630 inhibited the activity of 50 out of 330 kinases by more than 50%. Similarly, ripretinib inhibited the activity of 43 out of 330 kinases by more than 50%.
​
Next, we tested THE-630 in a series of standard in vitro pharmacology screens with targets including receptors, transporters and enzymes, with no liabilities identified. In addition, THE-630 was screened for potential drug-drug interactions and cardiac toxicity with standard in vitro safety pharmacology assays and no liabilities were identified.
​
Preclinical Pharmacokinetic and Tolerability Profile of THE-630 
​
Pharmacokinetic, or PK, studies of THE-630 were performed in rats and non-human primates, or NHPs, to evaluate bioavailability and compound half-life in vivo. Single doses were given at 3 mg/kg intravenously and 8 to 10 mg/kg orally. THE-630 demonstrated favorable oral PK in both species, with NHPs showing higher bioavailability (approximately 60%, compared to approximately 36% in rats) and longer half-life (t1/2) (13.1 hours, compared to 5.8 hours in rats), as shown in Figure 11 below.

19



Figure 11. Rats or NHPs were dosed intravenously, or IV, and orally, or PO, with THE-630 in order to evaluate bioavailability and half-life. The concentration of THE-630 in plasma was measured and plotted against time elapsed after administration of THE-630.
We have also completed a 28-day good laboratory practice, or GLP, toxicology study of THE-630 in rats and a 28-day GLP toxicology study of THE-630 in NHPs. The no observed adverse effect level, or NOAEL, in our NHP toxicology study was used to derive our proposed first-in-human dose. The NOAEL in the NHP toxicology study was observed at dose level which provided a Cav of approximately 75 nM, indicating a favorable therapeutic index of at least 0.75 when compared to our target exposure level in humans (Cav) of 100 nM. 100 nM Cav is the exposure we expect to demonstrate pan-variant KIT activity and meaningfully improve patient outcomes. The exposure levels achieved in NHPs at the NOAEL met or exceeded the in vitro IC50 values, measured in the presence of human serum proteins, for all KIT mutants evaluated. No adverse effects were seen in standard GLP safety in vivo pharmacology studies.
​
Clinical Development Plan for THE-630 in GIST
​
We designed our initial first-in-human Phase 1/2 clinical trial with the goal of evaluating monotherapy THE-630 in patients with advanced GIST across the spectrum of previously-treated populations. The clinical trial commenced with the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 1 portion in January 2022, and will consist of two phases:
​

● | Phase 1—Dose Escalation: patients with previously-treated, unresectable or metastatic GIST will be enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the trial. Patients must have disease progression on or be intolerant to imatinib therapy and have also received at least 1 of the following: sunitinib, regorafenib, ripretinib, or avapritinib. The primary objective of the dose escalation phase is to determine the safety profile of oral THE-630, including the dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs, maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, the RP2D, as well as PK and preliminary anti-tumor activity. We expect to report initial data from the Phase 1 portion of the trial at an academic meeting in the second quarter of 2023, and expect to report additional data through cohort 8 at an academic meeting in the fourth quarter of 2023. We believe that an important early pharmacodynamic indicator to provide proof of mechanism will be circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA, analyses. We are currently and will continue to be collecting ctDNA samples before, during, and after treatment to be analyzed by next-generation sequencing, or NGS, to characterize the KIT variants that are present and the effects of THE-630 on variant allele fraction over time. Given the heterogeneity of GIST, we believe that ctDNA analyses can help support our preclinical hypothesis that THE-630 has pan-variant KIT inhibition, as it will allow us to examine its effects on the spectrum of individual KIT variants seen in GIST patients. As of December 31, 2022, we were dosing patients in cohort 5 of the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, and we believe, based on data collected to date, that we will require 7 or 8 cohorts to reach the

target Cav of 100 nM, which is predicted to yield pan-variant KIT activity based on preclinical modeling in our PRA.

​

● | Phase 2—Dose Expansion: patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST will be enrolled at the RP2D into cohorts defined by prior therapy, including: (1) patients with second-line GIST who have had only prior imatinib therapy; (2) patients with fifth- or later-line GIST; and (3) patients with third- or fourth-line GIST. The Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial will further characterize the anti-tumor activity, PK and safety profile of THE-630 in these defined populations.

Figure 12. Outline of the design of our ongoing first-in-human clinical trial of THE-630. Our dose escalation and expansion cohorts are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of THE-630 in advanced GIST patients in second- through fifth- or later-lines of therapy.
Assuming positive clinical data and subject to discussions with the FDA, our registration strategy will evaluate THE-630 in two different GIST populations, fifth-line and second-line. There is currently no available therapy and therefore a significant unmet medical need in the fifth-line GIST setting. The data from the proposed Phase 1/2 clinical trial and feedback from regulatory authorities will inform the design of a potential registration trial in fifth-line GIST. We also plan to prioritize the evaluation of THE-630 in second-line GIST, where we believe our pan-variant KIT inhibitor, with activity against all major classes of activating and resistance mutations, has the potential to deliver meaningful clinical benefit over the current standard of care. We expect to run registrational studies in fifth-line and second-line GIST in parallel.

THE-349: Our Fourth-Generation EGFR Inhibitor
Summary Overview
Our second product candidate is THE-349, which is a fourth-generation inhibitor of EGFR that is active against C797X, the most common EGFR mutation that causes resistance to first- or later-line osimertinib treatment in patients with NSCLC, as well as the most common activating and resistance mutations seen in patients prior to treatment with osimertinib. Additionally, preclinical data has demonstrated that THE-349 has a high degree of kinome and wild-type EGFR selectivity, and exhibits substantial CNS activity.
NSCLC is the most common form of lung cancer with up to 50% of NSCLC tumors driven by activating mutations in EGFR, depending on geographic region. Treatment of EGFR-mutant metastatic NSCLC patients with first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs, such as erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and dacomitinib, substantively improved outcomes for patients compared to chemotherapy. However, resistance eventually develops in most patients, leading to disease progression, with about half of patients’ tumors developing the T790M EGFR mutation. Osimertinib, a third-generation TKI, was initially developed to treat T790M positive disease in patients progressing on a first- or second-generation TKI. Subsequently, it was approved in the first-line setting where it improved PFS and overall survival compared to earlier-generation inhibitors. However, most patients receiving treatment eventually progress. A subset of patients on osimertinib, either in first- or later-line therapy, will progress with EGFR-mediated resistance, primarily with the C797X mutation. A significant unmet medical need remains for patients with this subset of EGFR-mutant NSCLC.
​
Our target product profile for THE-349 is below:
​

● | potent activity against all major classes of mutated EGFR that could contribute to disease progression in osimertinib-resistant patients:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | the common activating mutations (deletions in exon 19 or the L858R substitution in exon 21);

The Market Opportunity in NSCLC for EGFR Inhibitors
Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and its incidence continues to grow. In 2020, an estimated 2.2 million new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed globally, accounting for approximately 11.4% of the global cancer burden. An estimated 1.8 million lung cancer deaths occurred in 2020. Among all cancers, lung cancer is currently the most common cause of cancer deaths in most countries, with North America and Europe having the highest rates. NSCLC is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of all lung cancers. Up to 50% of NSCLC tumors are driven by activating mutations in EGFR, depending on geographic region. Approximately 90% of these mutations are in exon 19 (exon 19 deletions) or exon 21 (L858R) of the gene that encodes EGFR. In patients whose tumors progress on osimertinib, C797X and other resistance mutations in EGFR have been observed at a frequency of up to approximately 12% after first-line osimertinib and 20% after second-line osimertinib.
Current Treatment Paradigm in EGFR-mutant NSCLC and Limitations
EGFR biology and means of inhibiting EGFR. EGFR, a member of the RTK family, plays a critical role in maintaining normal cell physiology in many organs and tissues. Since EGFR signaling is implicated in the genesis and progression of many cancers, it has led to the development of several classes of EGFR inhibitors. For example, the discovery of ligand-independent EGFR signaling in cancers led to the development and clinical characterization of EGFR TKIs, particularly in NSCLC. In particular, activating mutations within the EGFR kinase domain were found in approximately 10% to 15% of caucasian NSCLC patients and up to 50% of East-Asian NSCLC patients, and it was in these patients where strong response to first-generation EGFR TKIs, such as gefitinib and erlotinib, was observed.
​
The mutations targeted by marketed EGFR inhibitors and the resulting levels of efficacy. The major EGFR genetic alterations observed in NSCLC, the exon 19 deletions and the exon 21 L858R substitution, are mutations that cause ligand-independent activation of EGFR. The activation causes downstream signaling that promotes cancer cell survival and proliferation. First- and second-generation EGFR TKIs bind to the EGFR kinase domain’s ATP-binding pocket to inhibit activity and signal transduction. These first- and second-generation TKIs, which include gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib and dacomitinib, induce a high response rate of approximately 70% to 75% and provide a median PFS of approximately 10 months to 14 months. These clinical results are superior to the previous standard of care front-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy in EGFR-mutant metastatic NSCLC.
​
Resistance and unmet need in EGFR-driven lung cancer. Despite these advances, resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs has been observed, resulting in patient relapse, disease progression and death. The most common resistance mutation that arises in response to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs is the T790M mutation, a gatekeeper mutation in exon 20 that blocks TKI access to the ATP-binding pocket. Osimertinib was developed initially to counter this resistance mutation. Osimertinib was first approved in the US and globally for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy. In this setting, osimertinib yielded a high response rate (approximately 65%) and improved PFS compared to chemotherapy. Subsequently, osimertinib was approved in the first-line metastatic setting for EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution NSCLC after showing improved efficacy compared to earlier-generation TKIs, with a median PFS of 19 months and median overall survival, or OS, of over three years. More recently, osimertinib was approved as an adjuvant treatment after tumor resection for patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution NSCLC. Lazertinib and almonertinib are two additional third-generation TKIs approved for 

23



EGFR-mutant NSCLC, both with similar mechanisms of action to osimertinib. Lazertinib monotherapy is approved in South Korea for patients with EGFR T790M mutation positive disease who have previously been treated with an EGFR TKI, and the drug is also being evaluated in combination with a MET/EGFR bispecific antibody, amivantamab, in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Almonertinib is approved in China for patients with EGFR T790M mutation positive disease who have previously been treated with an EGFR TKI.
​
Resistance to osimertinib and other third-generation TKIs is an emerging limitation to the success of current EGFR TKI therapy, as shown in Figure 13 below. Several of the resistance mechanisms that have been seen to arise in response to osimertinib are EGFR-independent, involving amplification or oncogenic changes in other signaling pathways, such as the MET gene. However, in both treatment-naïve patients and patients with EGFR T790M-positive disease who progress on osimertinib, EGFR resistance mutations have also been observed. The C797X mutation results in the conversion of the targeted cysteine, or C, at position 797 of EGFR, into another amino acid, or X, with conversion to serine, or S, being observed in the vast majority of cases. In addition, several other EGFR mutations are found in osimertinib-resistant patients. C797X and other resistance mutations in EGFR have been observed at a frequency of up to approximately 12% after first-line osimertinib and approximately 20% after second-line osimertinib. Therefore, we believe that there is a critical need for a fourth-generation EGFR TKI that can block the array of resistance mutations in EGFR that arise across the first- through third-generation EGFR TKI therapeutic landscape. A summary of the major classes of activating and resistance mutations that must be inhibited by a fourth-generation EGFR TKI is shown in Figure 14 below.

Figure 14. Schematic of activating EGFR mutations and resistance mutations that arise following treatment with first-, second- and third-generation EGFR inhibitors. Activating deletions in exon 19 are referred to as Del19 mutations.

​
Figure 15. Nomenclature used to describe the major classes of EGFR activating and resistance mutations.
An important element in the development of EGFR inhibitors is ensuring selectivity for mutant EGFR compared to the wild-type, or non-mutated, EGFR that is normally expressed in human tissues. Inhibition of wild-type EGFR leads to gastrointestinal and skin toxicities that can be serious and dose-limiting. First- and second-generation EGFR inhibitors are limited by this toxicity, although third-generation EGFR inhibitors, such as osimertinib, have improved selectivity for mutant, activated EGFR and therefore improved tolerability.
​
Our Solution: THE-349, a Fourth-Generation EGFR Inhibitor with broad mutational coverage, wild-type selectivity, and CNS activity
​
Using our structure-guided approach, we have developed intricate computer models of the EGFR binding site that have provided a map of potential residues to target for increased molecular interaction. We have leveraged these detailed maps in the design of THE-349, which inhibits activating forms of EGFR and mutant forms with C797X and T790M resistance mutations, with wild-type EGFR selectivity. Using the triple-mutant Del19/T790M/C797X, or DTC mutant, as an in vivo screen, we have shown that THE-349 is orally bioavailable and shows strong tumor growth inhibition in vivo. For example, THE-349 was profiled against a series of mutant EGFR variants in vivo, including the single-mutant variant L858R, or L mutant, the double-mutant variant L858R/T790M, or LT mutant, and the triple-mutant variant L858R/T790M/C797X, or LTC mutant, and was shown to have strong anti-tumor activity against all three. THE-349 demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in two intracranial models in mice, with increased survival highlighting CNS activity/penetration.
​
Broad EGFR Mutation Coverage and Wild-type Selectivity Supported by In Vitro Data
​
To determine the ability of THE-349 to broadly inhibit single-, double- and triple-mutant EGFR variants, we first evaluated its activity in a kinase inhibition assay using EGFR kinases containing various combinations of activating mutations (L858R or L; Del19, or D) alone, or in combination with a T790M, or T, resistance mutation and/or a C797X resistance mutation. In addition to testing C797S, or C, the most common C797X resistance mutation, we also tested variants with a C797G or a C797A resistance mutation. Activity in these assays is reported as IC50 values, which is the TKI concentration that inhibits kinase activity by 50%. Erlotinib and osimertinib, two approved EGFR inhibitors, were included as controls. As shown in Figure 16 below, erlotinib and osimertinib did not potently inhibit mutants with a T790M or a C797X mutation, respectively. In contrast, THE-349 demonstrated low nanomolar IC50 values against all single-, double- and triple-mutant EGFR variants tested.

Figure 16. Summary of biochemical IC50 values of THE-349 and controls (erlotinib and osimertinib) against a panel of mutant EGFR variants
To determine the ability of THE-349 to broadly inhibit single-, double- and triple-mutant EGFR variants in a cellular context, we engineered a panel of Ba/F3 cell lines so their survival is dependent on different mutant EGFR variants. We then used these cell lines to assess cellular potency as represented by the IC50 value. We also measured the potency of each TKI against wild-type EGFR, also represented by the IC50 value, by determining the concentration required to inhibit phosphorylation of wild-type EGFR by 50% in A431 cells. We had previously observed that clinical efficacy of first-, second-, and third-generation TKIs against specific mutant EGFR variants is associated with a substantially lower IC50 value against the mutant variant than against wild-type EGFR as measured using these assays.
​
Figure 16 below shows the potency of erlotinib and osimertinib against wild-type EGFR, as well as against eight EGFR variants representing all major classes of activating and resistance mutations. These include: (1) a Del19 activating mutation alone, or D mutant, L858R activating mutation alone, or L mutant; (2) four double-mutant variants, Del19/T790M, or DT mutant, and Del19/C797S, or DC mutant, L858R/C797S, or LC mutant, L858R/T790M, or LT mutant; and (3) two triple-mutant variants, Del19/T790M/C797S, or DTC mutant, and the LTC mutant. As expected, based on its clinical profile, erlotinib had potent activity against the D, L, LC and DC mutant variants, but not against any of the three variants that contain a T790M mutation. In contrast, osimertinib had potent activity against D, L, LT and DT mutant variants, but not against any of the three variants that contained a C797S mutation.
​
In contrast to erlotinib and osimertinib, as shown in Figure 16 below, THE-349 demonstrated potent activity against all eight mutant variants. That is, THE-349 potently inhibited EGFR with a common activating mutation and maintain potency in the presence of a T790M mutation, or a C797S mutation, or both T790M and C797S mutations in the same protein. In addition, in all cases, all five mutant EGFR variants are inhibited with potency at least ten-fold greater than that against wild-type EGFR, suggesting the potential for on target EGFR-driven efficacy without the toxicities associated with wild-type inhibition.

Tumor Regression in In Vivo Mouse Models Harboring EGFR Activating and Resistance Mutations
​
We evaluated the activity of THE-349 in mouse tumor models to determine whether it has the necessary pharmacologic activity in vivo. To do this, we subcutaneously implanted Ba/F3 cells engineered with EGFR-mutant variants into immunocompromised mice, then administered compounds orally to groups of mice. When osimertinib was included as a comparator, mice were dosed orally using a standard regimen reported in the literature, 25 mg/kg QD. The degree of anti-tumor activity for each TKI was calculated as the percent tumor growth inhibition, or TGI, relative to tumors in control mice, unless tumors regressed relative to the first day of treatment, in which case the percent tumor regression, or TR, was calculated. We did not observe any signs of overt toxicity associated with these treatments.
​
We next evaluated THE-349 in five in vivo models. As shown in Figure 18 below, THE-349 had strong anti-tumor activity in all five models. For example, in a triple-mutant model expressing an EGFR triple-mutant LTC variant, THE-349 induced 88% TR, while osimertinib had only modest anti-tumor activity. In models expressing an EGFR single-mutant L variant or an EGFR double-mutant LT variant, both THE-349 and osimertinib demonstrated strong anti-tumor activity.
​
THE-349, in agreement with our panel of in vitro data, suggests that it is possible to design compounds that are orally bioavailable, wild-type EGFR selectivity, and which have activity against single-, double- and triple-mutant EGFR variants.

Evaluation of CNS Activity
EGFR-mutant NSCLC commonly metastasizes to the CNS, and the frequency increases with lines of therapy. Thus, CNS activity is an important attribute for drugs intended to treat this disease. To assess the potential of THE-349 to exhibit meaningful CNS activity, we measured its anti-tumor properties in two intracranial mouse models and measured drug concentrations in the brain and plasma compartments. THE-349 demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in H1975 LTC and PC9 (D) intracranial models in mice, with increased survival highlighting CNS activity. CNS activity reflects the balance of strong potency and ~9% brain:plasma ratio (Kp) in mice, which was observed to be similar in rats.

​
Clinical Development Plan
​
We expect to submit an IND application for THE-349 to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 and to initiate the Phase 1/2 trial as soon as possible thereafter. We plan to pursue initial clinical development as monotherapy in patients with on-target resistance, as well as rapidly expand into evaluation of combination treatment with other relevant modalities and, if clinical data support, target a broader second line patient population. Monotherapy dose escalation will enroll patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and prior Osimertinib/third-generation TKI, enriched for patients with the C797X with or without T790M mutations. Monotherapy dose expansion will enroll patients into cohorts defined by on-target resistance mutations (C797X and T790M), presence of active brain metastases, to characterize CNS activity, as well as a treatment naïve population. We plan to explore combination of THE-349 and other relevant modalities that are active in EGFR-mutant NSCLC in Phase 1b dose escalation and then expansion, in patients previously treated with osimertinib both with and without on-target resistance mechanisms. Our expected clinical development plan for THE-349 is summarized in Figure 20 below.

Our Pan-variant BCR-ABL Program for Refractory CML and Ph+ ALL
Summary Overview
Our third program is a pan-variant TKI for the treatment of refractory CML and Ph+ ALL. Both diseases are driven by the BCR-ABL fusion gene product. Our goal is to develop a next-generation pan-variant TKI for patients with relapsed/refractory CML and newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. 
​
CML is a disease which remains BCR-ABL driven through multiple lines of therapy, and patients commonly will relapse with a BCR-ABL resistance mutation. Multiple therapies for CML have been approved; however, approximately 30-40% of patients started on any TKI will switch to an alternative TKI due to side effects or inadequate response. For patients refractory to first-generation, or 1G, and second-generation, or 2G, TKIs, the treatment options include ponatinib or asciminib, but neither has an optimal balance of safety and efficacy. 
​

29



Newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL adults have historically received chemotherapy followed by allogenic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant, or HSCT, and more recently the addition of BCR-ABL TKIs have improved outcomes in 1L treatment, despite their lack of FDA approval for this use, though five are National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, recommended. However, in newly diagnosed patients treated in combination therapy with 1G or 2G TKIs, relapse is associated with BCR-ABL resistance mutations in up to 75% of patients, with the T315I mutation observed most frequently. Ponatinib, a pan-variant inhibitor, has been shown to improve clinical outcomes compared to 1G and 2G TKIs; however, toxicity limits optimal dosing.
​
Preclinically, our lead molecules have shown a high degree of potency against BCR-ABL and clinically relevant resistance mutations, and significant kinome selectivity, including against key off-target kinases.
We expect to nominate a development candidate for this program by early 2024, with the goal of pursuing clinical development in patients with CML who have been previously treated with a 2G TKI or have the T315I mutation, and in combination therapy treatment for newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ ALL.
​
Our target product profile for BCR-ABL is below:
​

● | Potent and pan-variant inhibition of BCR-ABL, including the T315I gatekeeper mutation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Tolerability profile compatible with long duration of treatment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | For CML patients: Highly effective and well-tolerated option post-2G TKI; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | For Ph+ ALL patients: A TKI that can provide durable, relapse-free, outcomes and reduce the need for HSCT.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
A selective, well-tolerated, pan-variant BCR-ABL inhibitor could substantially improve clinical outcomes in refractory CML, and could reduce the need for HSCT in patients with Ph+ ALL when administered as a front-line therapy.
​
The Market Opportunity and Treatment Paradigm in CML and Ph+ ALL
CML is a disease which remains BCR-ABL driven through multiple lines of therapy, and patients commonly will relapse with a BCR-ABL resistance mutation. In the last decade, the annual incidence of CML has remained steady at approximately two cases per 100,000 adults and was estimated to be 9,000 people in the US in 2020. Multiple therapies have been approved and it is considered one of the great success stories in targeted oncology due to the prolonged life expectancy since imatinib’s approval in 2001; however, approximately 30% to 40% of patients started on any TKI will switch to an alternative TKI because of side effects or inadequate response. For patients refractory to first- and second-generation TKIs, the treatment options include ponatinib or asciminib, but neither has an optimal balance of safety and efficacy. Asciminib is not pan-variant but is better tolerated. Ponatinib is a potent pan-variant BCR-ABL inhibitor but has a black box warning for vascular occlusion, heart failure, and hepatotoxicity. Despite the limitations of the currently approved BCR-ABL inhibitors for CML, the market opportunity is estimated to be greater than $5 billion based on global sales of the five approved TKIs for the treatment of CML in 2021. 
Newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL adults have historically received chemotherapy followed by allogenic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT), and more recently the addition of BCR-ABL TKIs have improved outcomes in 1L treatment, despite their lack of FDA approval for this use (five are NCCN recommended). However, in newly diagnosed patients treated in combination therapy with 1G or 2G TKIs, relapse is associated with BCR-ABL resistance mutations in up to 75% of patients, with the T315I mutation observed most frequently. Ponatinib, a pan-variant inhibitor, has been shown to improve clinical outcomes compared to 1G and 2G TKIs; however, toxicity limits optimal dosing. We believe that for newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ ALL, a pan-variant BCR-ABL TKI with a more favorable safety profile has the potential to provide durable, relapse-free, outcomes and potentially reduce the need for HSCT.

In vitro characterization demonstrated pan-BCR-ABL activity with increased selectivity versus ponatinib
​
To assess the on- and off-target potency of compounds, we engineered a panel of Ba/F3 cell lines so their survival is dependent on wild type or key mutant variants of BCR-ABL, or on activated variants of other “off-target” kinases that are also potently inhibited by ponatinib, the only approved pan-variant BCR-ABL TKI. We also assessed the degree of toxicity of compounds towards endothelial cells, using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and assessed the degree of kinome selectivity in vitro using a panel of 330 kinases.
As shown in Figure 21, the on-target BCR-ABL potency of Compound 1 was similar to ponatinib as measured by IC50s, while the off-target potency of Compound 1, one compound in a series of molecules we are evaluating in lead optimization studied, was similar to that of ponatinib, while the off-target potency of Compound 1 was shown to be substantially lower than ponatinib in all of the off-target assays tested.

Figure 21. In vitro characterization of Compound 1 versus ponatinib in Ba/F3 cell line.
In vivo model of Compound 1 showed similar tumor regression activity and superior tolerability to ponatinib
​
To evaluate the in vivo activity of Compound 1 in mice, we subcutaneously implanted Ba/F3 cells engineered with a BCR-ABL E255V mutant, the mutant that Compound 1 had the lowest potency against, and then administered compounds orally to groups of mice. As shown in Figure 22, Compound 1 induced strong tumor regressions, comparable to those induced by ponatinib. Furthermore, Compound 1 demonstrated improved tolerability compared to ponatinib, with keratinized skin observed in 8 out of 10 mice dosed with 25 mg/kg of ponatinib, but in 0 out of 10 mice dosed with 120 mg/kg of Compound 1.

Our Predictive Resistance Assay™ is Driving Development of Additional Novel Therapeutics
​
Based on the use of our PRA for multiple TKI families, including our current programs, we believe the novel PRA approach we used to evaluate KIT, EGFR and BCR-ABL TKI therapies is suitable for the prosecution of diverse kinase targets, as well as targets from other oncogenic protein families. As we apply our PRA more widely, we are guided by the clear principles of our research and discovery approach. We will focus on clinically validated targets with clearly defined patient populations and significant unmet medical needs. We will leverage our core competencies in structure-guided design for novel small molecule development and use our PRA to identify candidates that demonstrate on-target pan-mutant activity against known activation and resistance mutations. We believe our insights into small molecule drug design allow us to design and develop small molecule inhibitors that address on-target mechanisms of resistance to prior generation inhibitors while maintaining selectivity and offering the potential for superior tolerability.
​
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, particularly the field of oncology, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary and novel products and product candidates. We believe that our pipeline, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with differentiated competitive advantages. However, we have competitors both in the US and internationally, which include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, emerging and start-up companies, universities and other research institutions.
​
The key competitive factors that will affect the success of product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. We also compete with these organizations to recruit and retain qualified scientific and management personnel. We will also face competition in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
​
Our competitors have developed, are developing, or may develop products, product candidates and processes competitive with ours. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, have significantly greater financial resources, established presences in markets, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, gaining reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. Our competitors may succeed in obtaining approval from the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities or in discovering, developing and commercializing product candidates in our field before we do.
​
There are several approved therapies for the treatment of conditions for which we are attempting or may attempt to develop product candidates. In addition, we believe that a significant number of product candidates are currently under development, and may become commercially available in the future.
​

● | With respect to our most advanced product candidate, THE-630, there are several large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies marketing drugs for the treatment of GIST, including Blueprint Medicines, Inc., or Blueprint, Cogent Biosciences, Inc., or Cogent, Novartis AG, Pfizer, Inc., Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Deciphera, and Bayer AG. We are also aware of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies developing drugs for the treatment of GIST, including AB Sciences S.A., Arog Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CTTP, Exelixis, Inc., IDRX, Inc., Immunicum AB, Jiangsu HengRui, Inc., Ningbo Tai Kang Medical Technology Co. Ltd., Taiho Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Xencor, Inc. and Merck KGaA. In particular, Cogent has disclosed its registrational trial evaluating bezuclastinib in combination with sunitinib, which is being conducted in patients with second-line GIST, and Deciphera has disclosed its plans to evaluate ripretinib in a subset of patients with second-

line GIST. If successful, these products may compete with THE-630 to the extent we are able to advance it into earlier lines of treatment for patients with GIST.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | With respect to THE-349, we are aware of other pharmaceutical companies with approved drugs for treatment-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC, including AstraZeneca plc’s osimertinib, lazertinib, which is marketed by Yuhan Corp. in South Korea, and almonertinib, which is under collaboration between Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. and EQRx, Inc., which is approved in China. In addition, THE-349 may face competition from drug candidates in development for EGFR-mutated NSCLC, including those being developed by Alpha Biopharma Inc., Astellas Pharma Inc., Black Diamond Therapeutics, Inc., Blueprint, Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Bridge Biotherapeutics, Inc., C4 Therapeutics, Inc., CTTP, Genosco Inc., Genprex, Inc. and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

​

● | With respect to our BCR-ABL program, there are currently six BCR-ABL TKIs approved for use in CML: Novartis AG’s Gleevec (imatinib), Tasigna (nilotinib), and Scemblix (asciminib), Bristol Myers Squibb’s Sprycel (dasatinib), Pfizer’s Bosulif (bosutinib), and Takeda’s Iclusig (ponatinib). Iclusig (ponatinib) is indicated for patients with CML who have resistance or intolerance to at least two prior TKIs. It is also approved for patients with the T315I mutation. Scemblix (asciminib), is a fourth-generation TKI marketed by Novartis AG which was recently approved by the FDA. Other BCR-ABL TKIs under investigation include Enliven Therapeutics’ ELVN-001 program, which is in Phase 1 studies, Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company’s vodobatinib, Ascentage Pharma’s olverembatinib, Terns Pharmaceuticals’ TERN-701, and others at various stages of development. While there are no approved TKIs for Ph+ ALL, imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib are recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and Takeda recently announced positive results in a registrational trial evaluating ponatinib versus imatinib that demonstrated ponatinib statistically superior efficacy to imatinib in newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ ALL.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We also face competition broadly across the oncology market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drugs and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, product candidates may not be competitive with them. Additionally, product candidates may need to compete with drugs that physicians use off-label to treat the indications for which we seek approval. Moreover, many companies are developing new oncology therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as product candidates progress through clinical development.
​
ARIAD License Agreement
In June 2018, we entered into a license agreement, or the ARIAD License Agreement, with ARIAD, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda, for an exclusive, transferable (subject to certain restrictions), sublicensable (subject to certain conditions), worldwide license, under certain of ARIAD’s patent rights, know-how and compounds and a certain ARIAD chemical library, to develop, use, manufacture, market and commercialize certain compounds, and products that contain such compounds, that are therapeutically useful for the treatment of diseases and disorders in humans, including with respect to KIT (referred to as C-KIT, CD117, and stem cell factor receptor in the ARIAD License Agreement). THE-630 is derived from intellectual property licensed to us under the ARIAD License Agreement and is therefore subject to the ARIAD License Agreement.
​
Pursuant to the terms of the ARIAD License Agreement and related stock purchase agreements, we issued an aggregate of 1,615,427 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock to ARIAD (which converted to shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering in October 2021). We are obligated to make tiered royalty payments to ARIAD that are low- to mid-single digits of our future net sales and those of our sublicensees of each product comprising a licensed ARIAD compound in each country, beginning on the first commercial sale of such product in such country and ending on the later of (1) ten years following such first 

33



commercial sale and (2) the expiry of all patents that cover the product in such country, or the royalty term. Our royalty payment obligations are subject to reductions in certain circumstances.
​
During the term of the ARIAD License Agreement, we agreed not to use any intellectual property licensed to us, or any biological materials provided to us, thereunder to develop, use, manufacture, market or commercialize the same with respect to EGFR or any compounds or products that are potentially therapeutically useful for the treatment of diseases and disorders in humans with respect to EGFR (also known as ErbB1, ErbB and HER1). We did not use any intellectual property licensed to us, or any biological materials provided to us, under the ARIAD License Agreement to develop any of our other programs.
​
ARIAD may terminate the ARIAD License Agreement (1) for our uncured material breach of such agreement, (2) if we, or any of our affiliates or sublicensees, commence, and do not stop after receiving notice from ARIAD, any interference or opposition proceeding in relation to, challenges to the validity or enforceability of, or opposition to any extension of or the grant of a supplementary protection certificate with respect to, any ARIAD patent or patent application licensed under the ARIAD License Agreement, or (3) in the event of our bankruptcy. 
​
We have the first right to control the prosecution of, and to bring enforcement actions for infringement by third parties with respect to, the patents licensed to us under the ARIAD License Agreement, with input from ARIAD. If we determine not to prosecute or enforce an ARIAD-licensed patent then ARIAD has the right to do so under certain conditions.
​
The ARIAD License Agreement terminates, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, on expiration of the royalty term for such product for the applicable country. Thereafter, the licenses from ARIAD to us with respect to such product for such country will convert to a fully paid, royalty-free, irrevocable, and perpetual license.
​
Intellectual Property
​
We seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including by pursuing patent applications that cover THE-630, THE-349 and any additional product candidates we may develop, and methods of using the same, as well as any other relevant inventions and improvements that we believe to be commercially important to the development of our business. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the US and in jurisdictions outside of the US directed to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates (including compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations) that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business, and to defend any patents we may own or in-license in the future, prevent others from infringing any patents we may own or in-license in the future, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
​
As of December 31, 2022, our worldwide patent portfolio consisted of seventeen issued patents and 54 pending patent applications that we own or license related to our KIT and EGFR inhibitor product candidates. Specifically, as of that date, we owned or licensed two issued US patents, three pending US non-provisional patent applications, one pending US provisional patent application, three pending PCT patent applications, fifteen issued foreign patents, and 47 pending foreign patent applications.
​

34



More specifically, with respect to our KIT inhibitor product candidate, we own one pending PCT patent application and two foreign patent applications in Argentina and Taiwan and we license two issued US patents, two pending US non-provisional patent applications, fifteen foreign patents and 38 pending foreign patent applications, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and South Korea. Any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications are expected to have nominal expiration dates ranging from 2037 to 2042, absent any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions for regulatory delay. The KIT portfolio includes filings covering compositions of matter and methods of using our most advanced product candidate, THE-630, including one licensed patent with issued claims directed to composition of matter that encompass THE-630.
​
With respect to our EGFR inhibitor product candidate, we own one pending US provisional patent application, one pending US non-provisional patent application, and two pending PCT patent applications, and 7 pending foreign patent applications, including China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, and Mexico. Any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications are expected to have nominal expiration dates ranging from 2041 to 2043, absent any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions for regulatory delay.
​
Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In the US, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest US non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued US patent that covers or claims an FDA approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called patent term extension. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the US varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
​
The patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has been the subject of much litigation in recent years. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications and those of our licensors and collaborators may not result in patents being issued which protect product candidates or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive product candidates. Moreover, obtaining and enforcing patents in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is inherently uncertain, due in part to ongoing changes in the patent laws. Changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the US and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property and may increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities.
​
Commercial Strategy
We intend to retain significant development and commercial rights to product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, to commercialize product candidates on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the US and other regions. We currently have no sales, marketing, or commercial product distribution capabilities. However, we intend to build a focused sales and marketing organization and the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time in the US, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of product candidates. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which product candidates and programs are 

35



being developed. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence or alter our commercialization plans.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of THE-630, THE-349, as well as any other product candidates we may develop through our programs, for preclinical and clinical testing. We also expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and any other product candidates we may develop through our programs for commercial supply, if any product candidates obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our product candidates and any other product candidates we may develop through our programs and, if marketing approval is obtained, our commercial products.
​
However, as we progress towards commercialization of product candidates, we anticipate expanding the supply chain to include multiple contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs. We believe this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities and equipment, while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of product candidates.
​
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose procedural and documentation requirements. These regulations govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance. Our CMOs are required to comply with these regulations and are assessed through regular monitoring and formal audits. Our third-party manufacturers are required to manufacture any product candidates we develop under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and other applicable laws and regulations.
​
We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of companion diagnostics, which are assays or tests that identify an appropriate patient population, if needed for any product candidates that receive marketing approval.
Government Regulation
The FDA, and other regulatory authorities in and outside the US, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, manufacture, import, export, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, and promotion of drugs and biologics. We, along with third parties we work with, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing, and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the jurisdictions in which we wish to conduct studies or seek marketing approval of drug product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and biologics and ensuring subsequent compliance with applicable legal requirements presents a variety of risks and requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
​
In the US, where we are initially focusing our drug development and commercialization, we believe our product candidates, as small molecule drugs, would be regulated as new drugs rather than biologics. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing, approval or any other regulatory requirements relating to product manufacture, handling, safety, advertising, promotion, packaging, labeling, export, import, distribution, or sale, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for proposed or ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approvals, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, or criminal prosecution.

Preclinical Studies and Clinical Trials for Drugs
Before testing any drug in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulation and requirements, including good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements under 21 C.F.R. Part 58 and animal testing requirements under the Animal Welfare Act Amendments of 1976 (7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq.). The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND.
​
An IND is a submission to the FDA under which a sponsor proposes to administer an investigational product to humans. An IND must become effective before the proposed clinical trials may begin. The IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a full or partial clinical hold. The FDA must notify the sponsor of the grounds for the hold, and any identified deficiencies must be resolved before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. After the 30-day time period, the FDA can still raise concerns about the conduct of a proposed or ongoing trial and impose a full or partial clinical hold.
​
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to study subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, who generally are physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in a clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
​
Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee, or IEC, for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable compared to the anticipated benefits. The IRB or IEC also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA, the IRB or IEC, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials, including the reporting of certain types of adverse events to the FDA, as well as reporting completed clinical trials to public registries such as www.ClinicalTrials.gov, a clinical trials database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.
​
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the US is subject to the requirements of the applicable jurisdiction and may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the FDA may nevertheless accept the results of the study in support of an NDA if the FDA determines that the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if one is deemed necessary.
​
Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap.
​

● | Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product in a limited population of healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

37




metabolism, and distribution of the investigational product in humans, evaluate the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the drug’s potential efficacy, to determine the optimal dosages and dosing schedule, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended, with the other available evidence, to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. Under certain circumstances, the FDA can conclude that one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation plus confirmatory evidence is sufficient to establish effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials or post-marketing studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional evidence from the treatment of study subjects in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting, or in some cases to confirm clinical benefit. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of NDA approval.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA all participating investigators no later than fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Expanded Access
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational drug products outside of controlled clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. FDA regulations allow access to investigational products under an IND by the sponsor or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis.
​
In addition, the Right to Try Act from 2018 provides, among other things, an additional mechanism for patients with a life-threatening condition who have exhausted approved treatments and are unable to participate in clinical trials to access certain investigational products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial, are the subject of an active IND, and are undergoing investigation in a clinical trial that is intended to form the primary basis of a claim of effectiveness in support of FDA approval. There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its investigational products available to eligible patients under the Right to Try Act.
​

US Marketing Approval for Drugs
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA package requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a “refuse-to-file” decision by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective for the indications sought and whether the facilities in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged, or held meet standards designed, including current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements, designed to assure and preserve the product’s continued identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, or PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
​
Further, under PDUFA, each NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. For fiscal year 2023, the application fee for each application containing clinical data is $3,242,026. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each approved prescription drug, which has been set at $393,933 for fiscal year 2023. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on applications for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
​
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides advice and recommendations to the FDA as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
​
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more select clinical trial sites involved in conducting pivotal studies to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may require additional clinical or preclinical testing or recommend other actions, such as requests for additional information or clarification, that the applicant might take in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If the FDA issues an approval letter, the approval authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indication(s).
​
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies be conducted to further assess a product’s safety and efficacy, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. 

39



​
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the US, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the US when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the US for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a marketing application. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of PDUFA application fees.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the use for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity from the date of FDA approval during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the “same drug” for the same use, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of “clinical superiority” over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. The FDA defines “same drug” with respect to small molecule drugs as a drug that contains the same active moiety as a previously approved drug and is intended for the same use as the previously approved drug. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the US may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition, or if the manufacturer chooses to provide consent to approval of other applications. In February 2022, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for THE-630 for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. 
Expedited Development and Review Programs for Drugs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs and biologics to get them to patients more quickly than standard FDA review timelines typically permit. We intend to apply for these programs for product candidates, as applicable.
A new drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition, or it has been otherwise designated as a qualified infectious disease product. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed. Rolling review means that the FDA may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application.
In addition, a new drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation, in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient product development program beginning as early as Phase 1 and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development.

40



Any drug product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review and Accelerated Approval. A drug product is eligible for Priority Review, once an NDA is submitted, if the product that is the subject of the marketing application has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under Priority Review, the FDA’s goal date to take action on the marketing application is six months compared to ten months for a standard review, running from the date of FDA’s acceptance of the application for review in the case of a new molecular entity and otherwise running from the date of submission of the application to FDA.
The FDA may grant Accelerated Approval to a drug product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant Accelerated Approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.

The Accelerated Approval pathway is contingent on a requirement that the sponsor conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited proceedings to withdraw approval of the product. Periodic reports must be submitted to FDA on study progress. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. In addition, the FDA requires, as a condition for Accelerated Approval, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. After the 120-day period has passed, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
Even if a drug product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval, though they may expedite the development or review process.
Pediatric Study Plan and Pediatric Exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, as amended, or PREA, certain NDAs and certain NDA supplements must contain data that can be used to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product has been assessed to be safe and effective, and provide an assessment of the data gathered to support the safety and effectiveness of the product in the entire pediatric population. For a cancer drug directed at a molecular target, the pediatric testing requirement extends to pediatric cancers involving the molecular target even if different than the claimed adult cancer in the NDA. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to a drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, except that PREA will apply to an original NDA for a new active ingredient that is orphan-designated if the drug is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.

41



A drug can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the US. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
US Post-Approval Requirements for Drugs
Drugs approved by the FDA are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to manufacturing establishment registration and product listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, field alerts regarding issues with distributed drug products, and promotion and advertising compliance, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”). Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
​
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS, or FDA withdrawal of product approval.
​
US Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of our future product candidates, some of our US patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. 
Upon any approval of an NDA we receive, we may also be eligible to receive certain periods of regulatory exclusivity. For example, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the US to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another version of such drug that seeks to rely in whole or in part on the approved NDA with the exclusivity. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement for patents that the NDA holder has listed with the FDA.
Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
Companion diagnostics provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. Companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. In the US, the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption or FDA exercise of enforcement discretion applies, diagnostic tests generally require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercialization. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are clearance of a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FDCA, or 510(k), and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA.
To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, or for certain modifications to devices that have received 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device, which is typically a previously 

42



510(k)-cleared device. A proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device if the subject device (1) has the same intended use as the predicate device and (2) either (a) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or (b) has different technological characteristics but does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device and the submitted information demonstrates that the subject device is as safe and effective as the predicate device. If the FDA determines that the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, the subject device may be cleared for marketing. The 510(k) premarket notification pathway generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed, but can take longer.
A PMA must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures. FDA has committed to performance goals of reviewing original PMAs that are not referred to an Advisory Committee within 180 days and reviewing PMAs referred to an Advisory Committee within 320 days (excluding days when a request for additional information is pending with the applicant), although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or the device is determined to be unsafe or ineffective following initial marketing.
On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance document, for novel therapeutic products that depend on the use of a diagnostic test and where the diagnostic device could be essential for the safe and effective use of the corresponding therapeutic product, the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic, although the FDA recognizes that there may be cases when contemporaneous development may not be possible. However, in cases where a drug cannot be used safely or effectively without the companion diagnostic, the FDA’s guidance indicates it will generally not approve the drug without the approval or clearance of the diagnostic device. The FDA also issued a draft guidance in July 2016 setting forth the principles for co-development of an in vitro companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product. The draft guidance describes principles to guide the development and contemporaneous marketing authorization for the therapeutic product and its corresponding in vitro companion diagnostic.
Once cleared or approved, the companion diagnostic device must adhere to post-marketing requirements including the requirements of the FDA’s QSR, establishment registration and device listing, adverse event and device malfunction reporting, reporting of recalls and corrections, along with product marketing requirements and limitations. Like drug makers, companion diagnostic makers are subject to unannounced FDA inspections at any time during which the FDA will conduct an audit of the product(s) and the company’s facilities for compliance with its authorities.
Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of products following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the US in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the US Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.

43



Healthcare Laws
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers, and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the US, these laws include federal and state anti-kickback, false claims (for example, False Claims Act), physician transparency, and patient data privacy (for example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996(HIPAA)) and security laws and regulations, including those described below. Comparable laws exist in other jurisdictions.
Insurance Coverage and Reimbursement
In the US and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing healthcare services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, managed care organizations and other third-party payors, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the US, principal decisions about Medicare reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS and regional contractors responsible for administering the Medicare program. CMS and these contractors decide whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree.
​
Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the third-party payor’s determination that use of a product is (1) a covered benefit under its health plan; (2) safe, effective and medically necessary; (3) appropriate for the specific patient; (4) cost-effective; and (5) neither experimental nor investigational. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Moreover, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product candidate does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product candidate. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors, and coverage and reimbursement levels for products can differ significantly from payor to payor.
​
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, and imposing controls to manage costs. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of the product, which will require additional expenditure above and beyond the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. 
​
Moreover, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drug products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls or price increase penalties, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. This interest has resulted in meaningful proposed and enacted reform measures affecting healthcare reimbursement and drug pricing, including the enactment in August 2022 of significant changes to potential Medicare drug product reimbursement, as well as manufacturer rebate and discount obligations, under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
​

44



In addition, coverage and reimbursement for companion diagnostic tests is separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical products. Challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement similar to those applicable to pharmaceutical products will apply to companion diagnostics.
​
Compliance with Other Federal and State Laws or Requirements; Changing Legal Requirements
If any products that we may develop are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the US Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, among other requirements to which we may be subject. The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive recordkeeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products, and state licensure.
​
European Union Drug Development
Similar to the US, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the Clinical Trials Directive, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (NCA), and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. The Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 entered into application on January 31, 2022 and is directly applicable, thus the rules governing clinical trials are further harmonized. The Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a transition period during which the Clinical Trials Directive continues to apply to certain trials. However, all trials conducted under the Clinical Trial Directive must be transitioned to conduct under the Clinical Trials Regulation by January 31, 2025, if still ongoing at that point.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union and three European Free Trade Association States (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of marketing authorizations, a centralized MA and a national MA.

● | The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for

products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.

● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SmPC), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States or CMS) for their approval. If the CMS raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the CMS).

​
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. Similar to the US patent term-restoration, Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) serve as an extension to a patent right in Europe for up to five years. SPCs apply to specific pharmaceutical products to offset the loss of patent protection due to the lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval. Alongside patent protection, there are a number of regulatory incentives offered (including SPC extensions, regulatory data protection and orphan market exclusivity, amongst others). 
Outside the US, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization. 
Government Regulation of Personal Data Collection in the EU and UK
In the event we conduct clinical trials in the European Union, we will be subject to additional privacy restrictions. The collection and use of personal health data in the EEA is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data by any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA to the extent they process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, enhanced requirements for securing personal data, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and creates direct obligations on service providers acting as processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the US. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA member states, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result, depending on the type of violation, in fines of up to 2% of a company’s global turnover for the preceding financial year, or €10 million, whichever is greater; or up to 4% of a company’s global turnover for the preceding financial year, or €20 million, whichever is greater. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects

the right to claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, maintaining compliance with the GDPR will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place additional controls and processes ensuring compliance with data protection rules. There has been increasing enforcement of the GDPR since it took effect in 2018, but less so in biopharmaceutical development, so we face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the requirements on any future trials and we may be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of the law. Further, the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, means that it has in force its own legislation which is aligned with the GDPR, including the Data Protection Act 2018 and provisions of the GDPR incorporated into UK domestic law, or UK GDPR. The requirements are similar except that the United Kingdom is now regarded as a “third country” for the purposes of transfers of personal data from the EEA. Transfers continue to flow freely from the UK to the EEA following an adequacy decision from the European Commission adopted on June 28, 2021 and valid for four years, which may be renewed, if the European Commission finds that the UK continues to ensure an adequate level of protection.
​
Data protection authorities’ enforcement and advisory activities differ across the EU, creating some uncertainty in the manner in which data protection authorities seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. Data protection authorities may both conduct random audits of companies doing business in the EU, and act on complaints filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance are onerous and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
​
Should we utilize third-party distributors, compliance with such foreign governmental regulations would generally be the responsibility of such distributors, who may be independent contractors over whom we have limited control.

Employees and Human Capital
As of February 28, 2023 we had 38 full-time and part-time employees, of which 15 have M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Of our full-time and part-time employees, 25 were engaged in research and development activities and 13 were engaged in business development, finance and general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
​
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, motivating and integrating our existing and future employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants, and directors through grants of stock-based compensation awards and payments of cash-based performance bonus awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating our employees to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
